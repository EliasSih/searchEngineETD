This was tested by exposing female undergraduate students to media-portrayed idealised images that varied in their level of relevance, salience, or attainability. A negative impact of these images was indicated by greater post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation inaccuracy. In contrast, a positive impact was considered to have occurred when body dissatisfaction decreased and body size estimation was more accurate. If the images had a neutral impact on body image, one would expect little difference between groups or over time. A further aim was to determine whether a higher level of trait tendency to compare was related to more negative responding at post-exposure. In addition, thin ideal internalisation and restraint were examined as possible moderators. Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 indicated that idealised image relevance and salience had little differential impact on post-exposure body image. That is, exposure to thin idealised images, irrespective of the salience and relevance manipulations, resulted in similar post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation. In contrast to this, the attainability of the image seemed to influence post-exposure responding, at least in terms of body size estimation (Study 4). Higher trait tendency to compare was associated with a greater amount of self-reported comparison with the images, but had little impact on body image. Surprisingly, these results were not moderated by thin ideal internalisation or restraint. The role of individual differences was explored with additional analyses in Study 5, which revealed that, when the power is sufficient, thin ideal internalisation, restraint, and self-reported comparisons with the images predicted post-exposure body dissatisfaction, but not body size estimation. Overall, this program of research suggests that idealised image features do not play a vital differential role in determining post-exposure body image, unless it is the body itself that is being manipulated. Results from this research support the idea that the mere presence of an idealised body is sufficient to activate negative responses, and there was little, if any, evidence for the occurrence of positive responses. These findings are discussed in terms of social comparison and schema theory, and in terms of their practical implications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media portrayed idealised images</field><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="subject">social comparison theory</field><field name="subject">Social comparison</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"More than a liver" - the role of the social work practitioner in hepatitis C treatment centres</field><field name="creator">Mouton, Marlize, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hepatitis C is a fast growing infectious disease in Australia and is often associated with related psycho-social and mental health problems.  The conventional treatment process for hepatitis C is challenging due to a number of reasons.  This study explored social workers&#146; perceptions of the contribution of their role in hepatitis C treatment centres in relation to the treatment experience of patients.  The roles that social workers fulfill, their contribution to the multidisciplinary team and towards a culturally competent service, were explored.  Furthermore the knowledge, skills and values required for providing a competent service in a hepatitis C treatment setting was explored.  The broad theoretical frameworks that inform social work practice were considered, especially the biopsycho-social model, the strengths perspective, the critically reflexive approach and communications theory.  This qualitative study used a semi-structured interview method for data collection.  Ten social workers in hepatitis C treatment clinics participated in the study.  The findings highlight the needs of patients and how social worker participants described helping to address and meet these needs by employing their knowledge, skills and values through their social work roles and interventions in a team context in a multicultural and multi-faceted work environment.  A major challenge that social workers described was to keep patients on treatment despite debilitating side effects that diminish patients' motivation to complete treatment.  A shortcoming in the service was described to be the limited psychiatric support available at many treatment centres.  The findings lead to a number of recommendations to improve social work services in hepatitis C treatment settings.  More research was recommended in areas such as motivational techniques, psychiatric support, and effective group work strategies.  The need for increased funding for social work positions in the hepatitis C field was also highlighted.  It is anticipated that findings of this study can be applied to hepatitis C treatment in broader settings such as prisons, drug and alcohol settings and general practice.  This research will contribute to literature in the field of hepatitis C treatment models and in the field of social work practice in hepatitis C contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interferon treatment compliance</field><field name="subject">Social Work</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Treatment -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Multi disciplinary team</field><field name="subject">Chronic illness</field><field name="subject">Psycho social assessments</field><field name="subject">Social workers</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Australia -- Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C -- Patients</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing brush: an exploration of Taoist aesthetics</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Yi-Lan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dancing Brush video installation is dedicated to legendary Taiwanese dancer Tsai Jui-Yue (1921-2005) in the memory of her suffering, creativity and faith in life. This work reveals the true meaning of Chinese scroll paintings as an infinity of time and space. It draws on the notion of mobility as expounded in the I Ching or Book of Changes. Dancing Brush creates a modern cityscape where the principal of Taoism, ancient Chinese landscape painting, and calligraphy meet new media aesthetics. The focus of this thesis is to reassess media arts practice and aesthetics via the traditions of Chinese Taoist aesthetics. The research was conducted in three dimensions: ??non-linear aesthetics?? in Chinese arts as the new media art form, ??unity of emptiness and fullness?? as the animation principle, and ??subtraction aesthetics?? as the principle of creativity. I propose Dancing Brush video installation as a presentation of ??aesthetics of wandering contemplation??. The work suggests a feature of Chinese moving image aesthetics as a ??spatial montage?? form of media arts. I applied the Taoist ??decreative-creative process?? as the creative method in which the ??decreative?? process leads to the ??creative??. The ??decreative-creative process?? is based on the Taoist teachings of zi-ran (spontaneity) and wu-wei (non-action). I interpret it as ??subtraction aesthetics: less is more??. The process is to eliminate interferences with restricted narrative format and visual effects, then to receive the immediate presentation of things as pure materials. Through the subtracting process, it gains not less but more. Kong Bai (emptiness or formless) in Chinese art is the result of subtraction aesthetics. It reveals the creative principle derived from the Taoist idea of ??usefulness of useless??. The ??subtracting process?? in creating animation is to bring ??unknown?? to life. The ??image beyond image?? is the product of ??unity of emptiness and full?? where Chinese artistic realm yi-jing is created.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Taoist Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">subtractions aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The geomorphology of Southeast Australian mountain streams</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Chris J., Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the morphology and sediment transport dynamics of mountain streams in southeast Australia. Mountain streams represent important geomorphological and ecological systems in Australia which have hitherto been poorly studied. The variability of mountain stream reach morphology was investigated at the regional scale using topographical surveys and sediment sampling techniques. Study sites were stratified by slope and local lithology. Eight channel-morphologies including Bedrock, Cascade, Step-pool, Planebed, Pool-Riffle, Cascade-pool, Riffle-step and Infilled, were identified using an objective statistical approach. Overall, channel types were found to correspond to existing reach-scale mountain stream templates. Five morphologies were associated with a specific lithology type which controlled the size and shape of grains supplied to the channels.  Differences in coarse sediment transport processes between morphologies were investigated using stream monitoring techniques and Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. Monitoring results from a 3 year period indicated that channel beds are resistant to entrainment with shear stress thresholds for bedload transport ranging between 64 to 74 N/m2. Transport of reach median grain sizes requires floods that exceed bankfull discharge. Existing competence equations were found to over-predict the hydraulic driving force and consequently, a modified entrainment model was used to account for the regional channel characteristics.   OSL dating was investigated as a tool to provide data on long-term sediment transport processes. Minimum age model results from the OSL dates show overall agreement with a selected entrainment model, and indicate differences in sediment transport dynamics between some reach morphology types. A regime model was used to quantify the physical domains of different channel morphologies. Limitations of the model were overcome by modifying the sediment supply surrogate to better reflect the dominant transported bedload size. Morphology types were delineated according to different sediment transport capacity-sediment supply domains.  The distribution of channel morphology types within a series of catchments in southeast Australia was modelled within a GIS platform using the diagnostics of reach morphology derived from this study. The model provides a conceptual framework to evaluate the potential link between channel form, potential habitat diversity and aquatic biodiversity within the channel network in mountain streams.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mountain streams</field><field name="subject">morpho-statistical classification</field><field name="subject">channels</field><field name="subject">optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL)</field><field name="subject">bed material storage</field><field name="subject">morphologies</field><field name="subject">habitat diversity</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">bedload transport</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">sediment</field><field name="subject">geomorphology</field><field name="subject">Southeast</field><field name="subject">Southeastern</field><field name="subject">river channels</field><field name="subject">sedimentation</field><field name="subject">deposition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Invasive alien species and the protection of biodiversity: the role of quarantine laws in resolving inadequacies in the international legal regime</field><field name="creator">Riley, Sophie, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem of invasive alien species (IAS) is recognized as the second most serious threat to loss of biodiversity after habitat destruction. It is a problem largely created by humans as they transport and introduce species, deliberately and accidentally, from one part of the globe to another. The pressures exerted on biodiversity by international trade are one of the most serious aspects of the IAS problem. Although states are under obligations in international environmental law to prevent the entry of, and control, those alien species that threaten biodiversity, to date state practice has often been found wanting. In particular, quarantine regulation, which can be a state??s first line of defence against IAS, is mainly used by states to protect their farming and agricultural product sectors rather than biodiversity at large. The reasons for this include lack of domestic resources and lack of guidance at the international level. However, even if states were to expand the purview of quarantine, the question arises whether they would be able to use quarantine regulation to protect biodiversity from IAS while simultaneously fulfilling their international trade law obligations. This study seeks to answer this question by examining international environmental law and international trade law in their application to quarantine regulation. In doing so, the study identifies many areas of conflict. The different policies that underpin environmental and trade regimes mean that environmental concepts, such as the precautionary principle and the ecosystem approach, are difficult to apply within the international trade law regime. A way of achieving a more harmonized international response to the problem of IAS is suggested by incorporating environmental considerations into the international standards used by states to design and implement domestic quarantine measures. To facilitate the practical implementation of international standards the study further recommends appropriate financial and institutional capacity building mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SPS Agreement</field><field name="subject">Invasive Alien Species</field><field name="subject">Quarantine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family Size and Relative Need</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Bruce William, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three questions concerned with the relative income needs of families of different sizes - often summarised by indices known as ???equivalence scales???. The first is the extent to which researchers and policy makers should offset the costs of family composition (eg the expenditure costs of children) with the benefits associated with demographic choice (eg the ???joys of parenthood???). Chapter 2 concludes that there are demographic and financial market constraints that will often make a narrow focus on expenditure costs appropriate for distributional research and tax/transfer policies. However, this will not always be the case. One implication of this result is that it may be reasonable for distributional research to use different equivalence scales for adults and children in the same household. Part 2 of the thesis introduces a new method for the estimation of the within-household income distribution and expenditure costs of different family types. This is based upon the household welfare model of Samuelson together with Lau???s method for modelling the joint consumption of household goods. In Chapter 4, this method is applied to the estimation of equivalence scales for older singles and married couples. The estimation is based upon a detailed set of assumptions about the extent of joint consumption for 17 different commodity groups. The main conclusions are that: the theoretical model fits the observed behaviour well (with the exception of some home production effects); that aged couples share their income relatively evenly; and that the relative rate of pension for aged singles in Australia is probably too low. In Part 3, the thesis examines how changes in poverty can be estimated when there is uncertainty about the equivalence scale. The thesis proposes a new method which permits a set of upper and lower bounds for the equivalence scale to be assumed, which in turn determine upper and lower bounds for the increase in poverty. This method is applied to measure the change in poverty in Australia during the 1980s. Equivalence scales can be found that imply either an increase or a decrease in poverty.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer equivalence scales</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">living standards</field><field name="subject">household welfare</field><field name="subject">intra-household allocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of arterial stiffness by angiotensin receptors and nitric oxide in the insulin resistance syndrome</field><field name="creator">Brillante, Divina Graciela, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin resistance syndrome [INSR] is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and affects up to 25% of the Australian population. The mechanism underlying the relationship between the INSR and increased cardiovascular risk is controversial. We postulated that perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system [RAS] and endothelium-derived NO may be implicated in the development of early vascular changes in the INSR.  Repeated measurements of arterial stiffness [using digital photoplethysmography] and haemodynamic parameters in response to vasoactive medications were used to demonstrate the functional expression of angiotensin II [Ang II] receptors and NO synthase [NOS].  Ang II acts via two main receptor sub-types: the Ang II type 1 [AT1] and Ang II type 2 [AT2] receptors. The AT1 receptor is central to the development of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. The role of AT2 receptors in humans is controversial but is postulated to counter-act AT1 receptor mediated effects in diseased vascular beds. We demonstrated increased AT1 and AT2 receptor-mediated effects in small to medium-sized arteries of subjects with early INSR [Chapter 6].  In addition, functional expression of AT2 receptors in adult insulin resistant humans [Chapter 5], but not in healthy volunteers [Chapter 4] was demonstrated. AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with early INSR resulted in improvements in vascular function, with a consequent functional down-regulation of AT2 receptors [Chapter 7].  Functional NOS expression was demonstrated to be increased in subjects with early INSR compared with healthy controls [Chapter 6]. This was postulated to be a homeostatic response to counteract early vascular changes in subjects with early INSR. AT1 receptor blockade in these subjects reduced functional NOS expression [Chapter 8].  In conclusion, patients with early INSR represent a model of early disease where early intervention may be able to reverse the process incited by the initial exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Early vascular changes in these individuals are mediated at least in part, by increased AT1 receptor activity and/or expression, and may be detected by changes in arterial stiffness indices and non-invasive vascular reactivity studies. There is a compensatory increase in AT2 receptor and NOS expression/activity to counter-act these vascular changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial stiffness.</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Angiotensin receptors.</field><field name="subject">AT1 receptor.</field><field name="subject">AT2 receptor.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defendants, mental illness and negligence law: a critique</field><field name="creator">Bromberger, Nikki, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">At common law, liability in negligence is based generally on an objective standard of reasonable care. As a consequence of this idea those who possess reduced capacities, as compared to the ordinary reasonable person, may be held to standards which they are incapable of reaching. Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. Children are not required to behave the way reasonable adults behave. Rather, when the defendant is a child, courts take into account the capabilities which are a concomitant of the defendant???s age. A defendant???s mental illness, on the other hand, is not considered by courts in Australia (or elsewhere) to be relevant when determining liability in negligence. It has been argued that in this regard the common law is incoherent and unfair. This thesis considers whether these claims of incoherence and unfairness can be substantiated. In so doing, it considers the philosophical underpinnings of tort law in order to explore possible bases for the current law. It also examines a number of more specific accounts which attempt to justify the present law as it relates to mental illness. It is argued that none of these discussions provide a convincing basis for the different treatment in law between child defendants and defendants with a mental illness. The discussion extends beyond the confines of tort law to criminal law for explanations for the apparent incoherence. It notes the suggestion that the criminal law???s response to defendants with a mental illness has been fuelled to some extent by a misunderstanding of mental illness and a fear of those suffering from such illnesses. The thesis examines whether this negative attitude towards mental illness, which some scholars have referred to as ???sanism???, is at work in the few Australian decisions which have considered the common law position in relation to mentally ill defendants. Possible changes to this area of law are then outlined and considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activation of unsaturated N&#926;N, C=O, and C=C bonds using complexes of ruthenium and rhodium</field><field name="creator">Page, Michael John, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a broad range of coordination and organometallic chemistry on a series of ruthenium and rhodium complexes towards the aim of activating unsaturated N &#926; N, C=O, and C=C bonds.  The dinitrogen complex [RuTp(pzP)(N2)]BPh4 (5) (where Tp= tris(pyrazolyl)borate, and PzP= 1-(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)pyrazole) was synthesized via displacement of the chloride ligand from the complex [RuTp(pzP)Cl] (1). It was found that N2 coordination proceeded through an unusual oxidation/reduction cycle with the Ru(III) intermediate, [RuTp(pzP)CI]BF4 (6), isolated upon reaction of 1 with AgBF4 in THF. Investigations of the coordination chemistry of the related Tp complex [RuTp(Bp)PPh3] (4) (where Bp= bis(pyrazolyl)borate), resulted in several unusual reactions occurring on the Bp chelate. Reaction of 4 with AgBF4 gave the unusual product [RuTp(BpF')PPh3] (6), which had the Bp B-hydride substituents replaced by fluoride substituents from the BF4 anion, (i.e. BpF,). Alternatively, reaction of 4 with AgOTf, or SOCb, led to the synthesis of the products [RuTp(BpoH)PPh3]OTf (34), and [RuTp(BpoH)PPh3]Cl (35), respectively, which have a single hydroxyl substituent substituted in place of the two B-hydrides to yield a highly unusual neutral borane chelate (BpOH).  A series of ruthenium tris(pyrazolyl)methane (Tpm) complexes [RuTpm(PPh3)2Cl]BPh4  (44.BPh4) 	RuTpm(PPh3CI2]	(46),         [RuTpm(PPh3)2CI]BPh4 	            (44.BPh4) [RuTpm(PPh3)(MeCN)Cl]BPh4   (50),	          [RuTpm(PPh3HMeCN)](BF4)2        (51), [RuTpm(PPh3)(MeCNh](BF4)2 (52), and [RuTpm(MeCNhCI]BPh4 (54.BPh4) were synthesized. These complexes varied in the number of labile acetonitrile ligands they contained, the net charge of the complex, and the presence or absence of strongly coordinating phosphine coligands on the complex. The influence of these properties on the catalytic activity of the complexes for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated. It was shown that the net charge and number of labile MeCN donors on the complex had little influence on the activity of the catalyst. It was also observed that the catalyst [RuTpm(MeCN)2CI]BPh4 (54.BPh4), which does not contain a strongly coordinating PPh3 ligand, would rapidly decompose during catalysis.  A series of bis(tert-butylthiomethyl)pyridyl (SNS tBU ) pincer complexes [Ru(SNStBU)(PPh3)Cb] (65), [Ru(SN StBU)(PPh3)(MeCN)CI]BPh4 (66), [Ru(SNStBU)(PPh3)(MeCN)2](BF4h (67), and [Ru(SNStBU)(MeCN)Cb] (68) were synthesized and their as catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated. The activity of these complexes for as transfer hydrogenation catalysts was shown to increase as the number of labile coligands on the complex increased, with an extremely high transfer hydrogenation activity obtained using 68. The catalytic activity of 68 is one of the fastest to be reported in the literature, achieving a superlative TOF (turnover frequency) of 87360 h- I.  The coordination of SNStBu in 66 and the related complexes [Ru(SNS (MeCN)2CI]BPh4 (70), and [Ru(SNS)(MeCN)2CI]2[??-Ag(MeCN)2]2(BF4)4(71) was observed to yield a range of different conformational isomers. These isomers were studied in detail using low temperature NMR and 20 NOESY and COSY IH_1H correlation experiments. The complex 71 was also characterized crystallographically and was shown to have an unusual tetrametallic macrocyclic structure with two [Ru(SNS)(MeCN)2C1r moieties bridged by two [Ag(MeCN)2r ions through a chloro and thioether donor group.  The hydrogenation of unsaturated olefinic bonds was achieved using a series of Rh N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of the type [Rh(L)(COD)]BPh4 (where L= and NHC-pyrazolyl chelate). A series of NHC-pyrazoly ligands (L) were synthesized that contained varying degrees of steric bulk on the pyrazolyl and NHC donor group. The influence of these steric parameters on the rhodium complex structure and activity of the complexes as catalysts for the hydrogenation of styrene was investigated.

The materiality of the contemporary book is examined by revisiting its historical origins in the Middle Ages, to discover the extent in which the ???new??? media technology of mechanical printing determined the design and production of the fifteenth century book. Parallels were then drawn between these effects and those of digital technology on the book in this current New Media Age. The results revealed the book as a palimpsest, where remnants of ???older??? media remain embedded in the design and form of the ???new.??? While fundamentally situated in the field of graphic design, the study also ventures into the disciplines of architecture and the semiotic theories of Umberto Eco and Gunther Kress. The design of the research includes historical and theoretical analysis, case studies of selected contemporary book objects and a series of studio investigations into the space, form, techniques, processes and materials of traditional and contemporary book construction. The theories and design practices of William Morris, implemented in the studio investigations, included researching the origins of book production in the fifteenth century and the traditional hand technologies of papermaking, printmaking and bookbinding. New media investigations included experimental work with laser etching and the embedding of printed, paper pages in porcelain. A synthesis of the theoretical and practical research findings, was then interpreted as semiotic conceptual matrices, from which a Conceptual Framework was constructed. Conclusions drawn from the study reveal the design of the book as a palimpsest of past technologies that remain embedded in the design of the contemporary book. As a material demonstration of the thesis, a series of threedimensional conceptual models were developed as reading sites informing the design of contemporary books as palimpsest readings of the book as a material object for the New Media Age.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Books</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein engineering of DNA polymerase I: thioredoxin dependent processivity</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Joyce, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">DNA polymerases are found in a diverse range of organisms, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, viruses and bacteriophage. T7 DNA polymerase is a replicative enzyme from E. coli bacteriophage T7. It relies on the thioredoxin binding domain (TBD) of phage gene 5 protein (gp5) and E. coli thioredoxin (Trx) for processive replication of phage DNA. Although T7 DNA polymerase is processive, it is also thermolabile. In order to design a thermostable and processive DNA polymerase, the structural stabilities of the TBD and Trx were studied in respect to their binding affinity and affect on enzyme processivity. An artificial operon was designed for coexpression of subunits of T7 DNA polymerase. By means of a 9??His-tag at the amino terminus of gp5, T7 DNA polymerase complex was purified by one-step nickel-agarose chromatography, with subunits gp5 and Trx co-eluting in a one to one molar ratio. Purified T7 DNA polymerase was assayed for polymerase activity, processivity and residual activity and compared to the commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The two enzymes were not identical with commercial T7 DNA polymerase being less processive at 37??C. Mass spectrometry of the two enzymes identified a mutation of Phe102 to Ser in the Trx subunit (TrxS102) of commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The Ser102 mutation, was found near the carboxyl terminal helix of Trx. TrxS102 was less stable than wild type Trx. In the study of the TBD structural stability, a hybrid polymerase was constructed by inserting the TBD motif into the homologous position in the Stoffel fragment of Taq DNA polymerase. The hybrid enzyme was coexpressed with Trx from an artificial operon; however, the TBD inserted retained a mesophilic binding affinity to Trx. The chimeric polymerase required 100 molar excess of Trx for processive polymerase activity at 60??C. TBD structural deformation at elevated temperatures was hypothesized to be the cause of the change in the subunit stoichiometry. Mutagenesis of TBD would be required to increase its thermostability. An efficient, rapid high throughput mutagenesis method (SLIM) was invented and would be appropriate for further studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA polymerases</field><field name="subject">protein engineering</field><field name="subject">thioredoxin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis of amines and imines organometallic catalysts</field><field name="creator">Rumble, Sarah Louise, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes investigations into the catalysed syntheses of amines and imines using organoiridium and organorhodium complexes with N-donor ligands as the catalysts. These catalysed syntheses were achieved via hydroamination, hydrosilylation, and hydrogenation reactions, as well as tandem hydroamination/imine reduction reactions. An in situ catalysis study found that the most active catalysts for the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1) to give 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (4) were formed from a combination of catalyst components that resulted in an electron deficient metal centre, indicating that an alkyne binding mechanism was most likely. The kinetics of the hydroamination of 4-pentyn-1-amine (1), catalysed by the complexes [Rh(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (7), [Ir(bim)(CO)2][BPh4] (8), [Rh(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (9),and [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) (bpm = bis(1-pyrazolyl)methane and bim = bis(Nmethylimidazol- 2-yl)methane) were modelled and compared. The nature of the metal centre was found to have the most influence on the rate of the product release step, while the nature of the N-donor ligand was found to have the most influence on the rate of the substrate binding step. The investigation of the catalysed hydroamination of the phenyl substituted alkynylamines 5-phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (2), 4-phenyl-3-butyn-1-amine (13) and 2- phenyl-4-pentyn-1-amine (34) revealed a difference in catalytic activity between the rhodium and iridium complexes depending on the alkyne substituent. A series of novel rhodium(I) complexes were synthesised: [RhClCO(Mes-DAD(Me))] (38), [RhClCO(Mes-BIAN)] (22), [Rh(COD)(Mes-BIAN)][BF4] (39), [Rh2(COD)2(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (40) and [Rh2(CO)4(bmimen)](BPh4)2 (41), where Mes- DAD(Me) = biacetylbis(2,4,6-trimethylphenylimine), Mes-BIAN = bis(2,4,6- trimethylphenylimino)acenapthene and bmimen = 1,2-bis[(1-methyl-2- imidazolyl)methylene-amino]ethane. The cationic complex 40 was found to be an active hydroamination catalyst, while the neutral complexes 38 and 22 were only active in the presence of the tetraphenylborate counterion. A range of imines was found to be efficiently reduced to their respective amines via hydrosilylation or hydrogenation using the iridium(I) complex [Ir(bpm)(CO)2][BPh4] (10) as catalyst. The hydrosilylation reaction was found to be significantly faster in a protic solvent (methanol), giving the desilylated amines without the need for a desilylation step. The mechanism of this reaction was proposed to involve a monohydride iridium(I) complex as a key intermediate. The tandem hydroamination/hydrosilylation of a series of alkynylamine substrates was achieved using the iridium complexes 8 and 10, in which the iridium complex catalyses the two mechanistically distinct reactions in the one-pot. Catalysed tandem hydroamination/hydrogenation reactions were also achieved, but were less facile.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amines</field><field name="subject">organometallic catalysts</field><field name="subject">imines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23422</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Living within protected areas in Vietnam: situations, issues and strategies</field><field name="creator">Thuy Thi Phan</field><field name="description">Many of the world&#8217;s protected areas (PAs) are inhabited, and this is a challenge for governments, organizations and individuals who need to reconcile the demands of both conservation and development. Resettlement has been seen as one strategy to achieve this. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that in countries such as Vietnam little information on biodiversity conservation has been documented and information both on the resettled people and the condition of PAs after resettlement &#8211; are either scanty or completely absent. This study focused on the perspectives of people living within PAs in Vietnam, and examined their socio-economic situations, the development and conservation issues they confront, and the strategies that are employed by various levels of government and other agencies to deal with their presence within PAs. This was done using Pu Mat National Park (PMNP) as the main case study in order to address three questions: (1) What were the conservation and development issues people within PMNP faced? (2) Why was resettlement chosen and how was it implemented? and (3) What were the impacts of the resettlement program in ensuring both conservation and development outcomes. Another five supplementary case studies: Cuc Phuong National Park, Ba Be National Park, Xuan Son National Park, Cat Tien National Park and Pu Huong Nature Reserve were selected as comparisons with PMNP. The case studies were examined using a variety of qualitative and quantitative data derived from documentary sources, key informants, semi-structured interviews, group discussions and participant observation. PMNP has extremely high biodiversity and is of nternational conservation significance. It was officially confirmed as a PA, the highest classification for biodiversity conservation in Vietnam. An ethnic minority group, the Dan Lai, live in three villages located on the upper streams of the Khe Khang Valley 15-45 km within the Park&#8217;s Core Zone in one of the most important conservation areas of PMNP. The Dan Lai, however, have been doubly disadvantaged because their location remains undeveloped and their lives are restricted by conservation regulations. As a result, since 1997 when Pu Mat Nature Reserve was established, their living standards have deteriorated. Resettlement projects have had mixed effects on the livelihoods of the Dan Lai in both the short- and long-terms, with negative impacts outweighing the positive. In both cases, the resettled people received more advantages in terms of regional development and support from other projects. However, the land at the new site was of poor quality, and the Dan Lai, who are not used to an intensive farming system, suffered agricultural failures. Resettlement also failed in mitigating the marginalization of the affected people in the program&#8217;s early stages. In terms of conservation outcomes, however, the resettlement projects impacted positively in both the short- and long-terms. The local people in resettled villages now have better knowledge about conservation and their attitudes toward conservation are more positive. In the new sites they are also less involved in forest exploitation. It appears that the Dan Lai have not been the main cause of recent biodiversity loss in the Park as they have mainly exploited forest products for their subsistence needs. Rather, people from outside, some of them professional hunters, fishermen and loggers, have more seriously impacted on conservation. However, with increasing exposure to people from outside and accelerating forest exploitation and economic development, the Dan Lai&#8217;s influence on the Park is now beginning to pose a greater danger to conservation. Taking all these factors in account, this study concluded that resettlement into more developed areas would now be the most appropriate action for the Dan Lai remaining in the Park. With the five supplementary case studies, overall it was found that, on the one hand, the residents of PAs have very low living standards. On the other, it cannot be denied that these people pose significant threats to conservation as populations rapidly increase and lifestyles are gradually shifting to embrace a market orientated economy. Several strategies have been employed in the five supplementary case studies but most of these have not been effective or enduring. All five PAs, except Pu Huong Nature Reserve, have pursued a resettlement approach. When resettlement has been undertaken only a part of the population has been relocated with more people needing to be moved in the future. Other collaborative management approaches have been only party employed in two cases. Because of the diversity and complexity of different situations in various PAs in Vietnam, it is not possible to prescribe a single strategy or framework for people living within them. However, in the six cases examined in this study, the strategies selected have not achieved the expected outcomes. This indicates that finding an effective framework for this issue that is practical in the Vietnamese context is an urgent task. Experience from resettlements both within Vietnam and globally demonstrates that in order to achieve both development and conservation objectives, appropriate resources and a well developed plan are required for successful resettlement.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:162396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re-interpreting Modern Chinese Art: An Analysis of Three Women Artists In Twentieth-Century China (Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen)</field><field name="creator">Hwee Leng Teo</field><field name="description">There have been only sporadic attempts to highlight Chinese women&#8217;s role and influence in art, even though their contribution has been major. This thesis seeks to understand the significance of women&#8217;s participation in modern Chinese art history through the narratives and works of Pan Yuliang, Nie Ou and Yin Xiuzhen, who were professionally active at different political stages of twentieth-century China. Using an interdisciplinary framework, drawing on concepts from theories such as modernism, feminism and postcolonialism, this thesis analyzes a culturally specific field in art history and the interrelationship between various factors that have contributed to it. As artists of a peripheral culture, various factors in the artistic production of Chinese women have been overlooked and often misinterpreted. This thesis argues that the three artists in this study have produced different, individualized responses to the Euro-American model of modernism. To highlight the cultural specificity of China, the introductory chapter will include a short comparative analysis between Chinese modernism and the modernisms of other Asian countries. The adoption of Western art forms by early overseas-trained Chinese artists such as Pan indicates as many intricacies and ambivalences as in the complex relationship of China with Western imperialism. Chapter Two situates the Westernized works of Pan in the context of Chinese modernism, pre-feminism and the semi-colonized state of early twentieth-century China. In relation to the theories of orientalism and provincialism, implications of the ambiguities of Pan&#8217;s representations are extended to debates that explore the subjectivity and identity of non-European artists in their quest for modernism. Nie Ou was born into the era when the Chinese Communists had just taken over in 1949. Under the autocratic rule of the Communists, Nie was exiled to the northern countryside during her early adulthood as part of the &#8220;re-educating the elite&#8221; program. Chapter Three demonstrates how Nie successfully emerged from the repercussions of the Cultural Revolution. During this period of intensified Chinese nationalism, Nie found ways to merge the influences of the restrictive style of Socialist Realism and the poetic Chinese literati painting tradition to create an individualized style of representation. China underwent rapid modernization in the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter Four examines the works of contemporary artist Yin Xiuzhen who, with her avant-garde installations, has pushed the boundaries of what constitutes conventional Chinese art. This chapter analyzes Yin&#8217;s works in the context of late twentieth-century China, where the nation was no longer a Socialist monolith but a complex amalgam in which old and new, Socialist and capitalist, modern and postmodern co-existed. Yin&#8217;s works will be studied in relation to theories of postmodernism, postfeminism and globalism. Chapter Five consolidates the earlier chapters by reflecting on how various conditions throughout the twentieth century have changed and shaped the role of women in Chinese art history. The concluding chapter will consider the influence Chinese women artists may have on the art discourse in China today, and perhaps across other cultures. This chapter will explore the constraints upon them and the potential of their future role, not only in China but also in the broader sense of what it means to be an artist internationally.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Chinese culture, Chinese women artists, feminism, postcolonialism, modernism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sovereignty and Responsibility</field><field name="creator">Luke Glanville</field><field name="description">The object of this thesis is to consider the relationship between sovereignty and responsibility and to examine how this relationship has developed over time. There is a conventional story told by many scholars of International Relations which holds that sovereignty has &#8216;traditionally&#8217; entailed the absence of responsibility and accountability. It has meant that states have a right to govern themselves however they choose, free from outside interference. Only in recent years, the tale goes, have the indefeasible rights that sovereigns have long enjoyed been challenged by notions that sovereigns are responsible and accountable for the protection of their populations. Ideas of &#8216;sovereignty as responsibility&#8217; and &#8216;the responsibility to protect&#8217; which have emerged since the end of the Cold War are framed as radical departures from the way in which sovereignty has been &#8216;traditionally&#8217; understood. This thesis challenges this conventional account of the history of sovereignty. It argues that the notion that sovereignty entails responsibilities is not new. Rather, responsibilities have been an enduring feature of the social and historical construction of sovereignty. The thesis demonstrates that sovereignty has been understood to involve varied and evolving responsibilities since it was first articulated in early modern Europe and it traces the historical development of the particular tension between the right of sovereign states to be self-governing and free from outside interference and their responsibility to secure the safety of their populations.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sovereignty</field><field name="subject">responsibility</field><field name="subject">responsibility to protect</field><field name="subject">international history</field><field name="subject">constructivism</field><field name="subject">English school</field><field name="subject">non-intervention</field><field name="subject">humanitarian intervention</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systems science analysis of the context/s of child protection reform in Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Joel Cullin</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">Child protection, reform, systems science, complexity, cybernetics, system theory, organisational reform, Queensland child protection system, Department of Child Safety.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrogen Removal in Bioelectrochemical Systems</field><field name="creator">Bernardino Virdis</field><field name="description">Bioelectrochemical systems couple the oxidation of an electron donor at the anode with the reduction of an electron acceptor at the cathode, using microorganisms to catalyse one or both reactions. When the overall reaction is exergonic, a power output is generated and the system is referred to as microbial fuel cell (MFC); when power is added to the system and hydrogen is produced at the cathode through electrolysis of water, the system is referred to as microbial electrolysis cell (MEC). This PhD thesis is principally focused on the microbial fuel cells technology. Microbial fuel cells are regarded as a sustainable technology for electric energy generation from the oxidation of organic substrates contained in wastewater. The rising need for renewable energy sources and sanitation has encouraged intense research in this novel technology. Nevertheless, up untill now the interest has been primarily focused on the anodic oxidation of organic matter contained in wastewater. However, in addition to organics, wastewater also contains other pollutants, such as soluble nitrogen compounds, for which specific treatment is required. In conventional wastewater treatment systems, the organics available in the wastewater are typically used as electron donor during denitrification. However, a considerable fraction (&gt;50%) of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) is still oxidized aerobically due to the large recirculation flows from the nitrification to the denitrification stages required in anoxic/aerobic configurations to allow for low nitrate levels in the final effluent. This increased COD demand is normally fulfilled by supplementary COD addition, with consequent increase of treatment costs. Alternatively, microorganisms can use inorganic carbon substrates and inorganic electron donors such as hydrogen for denitrification. However, the use of compressed hydrogen is hampered by its low solubility. As a solution, electrochemical hydrogen production permits in situ delivery of the electron donor and is advantaged by simplified control and dissolution of H2. The energy requirements to provide reducing power for denitrification can be decreased if bacteria use the electrode directly as electron donor without intermediate hydrogen production in bioelectrochemical systems. However, fundamental knowledge on bioelectrochemical denitrification is still lacking, therefore, this PhD thesis aims to fill some of these knowledge gaps and to solve some of the bottlenecks of the use of biocathodes. In particular, the goals of this work are: (i) to produce a suitable microbial community able to use the cathode as the sole electron donor during denitrification; (ii) to engineer a bioelectrochemical system able to couple the cathodic denitrification with the oxidation of organics at the anode; (iii) to characterize and quantify the electron losses during anodic and cathodic processes; (iv) to develop a bioelectrochemical system that maximises the nitrogen removal by integrating the nitrification stage into the cathode; finally, (v) to provide an insight into the structural properties of the biofilm performing nitrogen removal at the cathode. The results reveal that microbes can effectively utilize the electrode as electron donor for nitrate reduction to gaseous nitrogen at a redox potential that excludes intermediate production of hydrogen. Measurements revealed that acetoclastic methanogenesis and bacterial growth were responsible for causing the major electron losses at the anode. Adjusting the anodic potential did not achieve a significant overall reduction of the electron losses. At the cathode, the charge transfer efficiencies were instead very high, with the losses only due to the generation of nitrous oxide. Moreover, adjustments of the cathode potential resulted in higher efficiency. High carbon and nitrogen removal was obtained with a COD demand for denitrification as low as 2.4 g per g nitrogen denitrified, which is much lower than typically observed in heterotrophic&#8211;based nitrogen removal technologies (&gt;7 g g 1). Nitrogen was removed at rates up to 0.256 kg N m-3 d-1, which is comparable to other autotrophic denitrification processes. Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was observed in a combined system with cathodic aeration, at bulk dissolved oxygen (DO) levels up to 5 mg L-1, which is considerably higher than normally considered feasible for the process. Confocal laser scanning microscope analysis revealed the existence of a structured biofilm where putative nitrifying organisms occupied the outer layers in contact with the aerated bulk liquid, and putative denitrifying organisms occupy the layers closer to the electrode. These findings are significant in the field of bioelectrochemical systems as they help to unravel some of the complex questions relating to biocathodes. Additionally, the system provides an attractive option to achieve a very high level of nitrogen removal from wastewater with low COD/N ratios due to the selective utilisation of the COD for the denitrification reaction via the electrical transfer of reducing equivalents from the anode to the cathode. However, this research creates new questions, particularly regarding the mechanisms of electron transfer at the cathode. Also a number of practical design and optimisation challenges need to be overcome before wider applications can be considered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbial fuel cells</field><field name="subject">Biocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrochemical systems (BESs)</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Nitrification</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Framework for the Long-Term Operation of a Mobile Robot via the Internet</field><field name="creator">Shervin Emami</field><field name="description">This report describes a docking system to allow autonomous battery charging of a mobile robot, and a Web interface that allows long-term unaided use of a sophisticated mobile robot by untrained Web users around the world. The docking system and Web interface are applied to the biologically inspired RatSLAM system as a foundation for testing both its long-term stability and its practicality for real-world applications. While there are existing battery charging and Web interface systems for mobile robots, the developed solution combines the two, resulting in a self-sufficient robot that can recharge its own batteries and stay accessible from the Web. Existing mobile robots on the Internet require manual charging by a human operator, leading to significant periods when the robot is offline. Furthermore, since the robot may be operational for extended periods without powering down, it may perform learning operations that require significantly longer operation than a single battery-recharge cycle would allow. The implemented Web interface makes use of the RatSLAM navigation system. RatSLAM provides the onboard intelligence for the robot to navigate to the user-supplied goal locations (such as &#8220;go to location X&#8221;), despite long paths or obstacles in the environment. The majority of the existing robot interfaces on the Internet provide direct control of the robot (such as &#8220;drive forward&#8221;) and therefore the users suffer greatly from the inherent delays of the Internet due to the time lag between performing an action and seeing the feedback. Instead, the robot in this study uses an onboard intelligent navigation system to generate all low-level commands. Due to the minimal input required to give high-level commands to the robot, the system is robust to the long and highly unpredictable delays of Internet communication. Traditional methods of autonomous battery charging for mobile robots have had limited reliability, often due to the mechanical docking system requiring a highly precise connection. Therefore, the mechanical design of the implemented battery charging system improves reliability by allowing for a significantly larger navigation error. In addition, the robot uses a standard vision sensor for both the long-range and short-range stages of navigation to the battery charger, compared to the many systems that require an omnidirectional camera and a high-resolution Laser range finder for this process. The result of this study is a public web interface at "http://ratslam.itee.uq.edu.au/robot.html" (currently offline), where any Web user in the world can watch and control the live mobile robot that is using RatSLAM for navigation, as it drives in its laboratory environment without human assistance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">10 Technology</field><field name="subject">mobile robotics</field><field name="subject">telerobotics</field><field name="subject">web robots</field><field name="subject">supervisory control</field><field name="subject">docking</field><field name="subject">autonomous recharging</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of bacterial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis.</field><field name="creator">Psaltis, Alkis James</field><field name="description">This thesis embodies research investigating the role that bacterial biofilms play in the pathogenesis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). It focuses on their detection on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients and the implications of their presence. Finally, it addresses deficiencies in the innate immune system that may predispose to their development in this condition. Bacterial biofilms are structural assemblages of microbial cells that encase themselves in a protective self-produced matrix and irreversibly attach to a surface. Their extreme resistance to both the immune system as well as medical therapies has implicated them as playing a potential role in the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases. Although their role in many diseases is now well established, their objective presence and importance in CRS remains largely unknown. Chapter 1 of this thesis reviews the current literature pertaining to CRS and biofilms and critically evaluates the small body of research relating to this topic. Chapter 2 describes the development of a sheep model to study the role of bacterial biofilms in rhinosinusitis. It compares the use of traditional electron microscopy (EM) and more recent confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) in the detection of biofilms on the surface of sinus mucosa. The results of this study inferred a causal relationship between biofilms and the macroscopic changes that accompany rhinosinusitis. Furthermore it illustrated the superiority that CSLM has over EM in the imaging of biofilms on sinus mucosa Chapter 3 and 4 outline the results of human studies utilizing the more objective CSLM to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial biofilms on the sinus mucosa of CRS patients and their effect on post-operative mucosal healing. The results of these studies demonstrated a biofilm prevalence of approximately 50% in the CRS population studied and suggested, that biofilm presence may predispose to adverse post-operative outcomes following sinus surgery. Chapter 5 and 6 describe experiments examining the level of the innate immune system&#8217;s anti-biofilm peptide lactoferrin, in patients with CRS. Lactoferrin was found to be downregulated at both an mRNA and protein level in the majority of CRS patients, with biofilm positive patients demonstrating the most significant reduction. In summary, this thesis provides further evidence that bacterial biofilms play a major role in the pathogenesis and disease persistence in a subset of CRS patients. Deficiencies in components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin, may play an important role in the predisposition of certain individuals to the initial development of bacterial biofilms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biofilms; chronic rhinosinusitis; lactoferrin</field><field name="subject">Sinusitis</field><field name="subject">Biofilms</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/50962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pivotal role of insulin-like growth factors in pregnancy success.</field><field name="creator">Sferruzzi-Perri, Amanda Nancy</field><field name="description">Appropriate placental development in early gestation is essential for subsequent placental function and hence optimal fetal growth and pregnancy outcome. Placental insufficiency has been implicated in common disorders of pregnancy, which result in fetal and maternal mortality or morbidity, and also increase the risk of poor health in adult offspring. Prior to the onset of maternal blood flow to the placenta at ~10 weeks of gestation, placentation occurs in a relatively hypoxic environment, which is essential for healthy pregnancy. IGF-II is abundantly expressed by the invasive trophoblast and may interact with oxygen to regulate placentation. Additionally, maternally-derived IGFs may act on the placenta and the mother to regulate fetal growth. This thesis investigated the role and interaction of oxygen and IGF-II on human placental outgrowth during early pregnancy in vitro. Furthermore, the impact of maternal IGF treatment during early to mid pregnancy, on placental development and substrate transfer, nutrient partitioning between the mother and fetus, and fetal growth, were also determined in mid and late gestation in guinea pigs. We have demonstrated, using human early first trimester placental villous explants, that IGF-II mediates the effect of hypoxia on placental outgrowth. Culture of placental explants in hypoxia, or with exogenous IGF-II, enhanced trophoblast outgrowth and inhibited TGF-&#946;1 activation, a negative regulator of trophoblast function. In addition, culture of explants in hypoxia induced Igf2 gene expression in outgrowing trophoblast, without altering Upar, Igf1r, Igf2r or Tgf&#946;1 transcription. We propose that this novel interaction of oxygen, IGF-II and TGF-&#946;1 during pregnancy is an important determinant of placental development. Furthermore, we showed that exogenous IGF-II stimulates villous explant trophoblast outgrowth in placenta from &gt;10 weeks gestation, suggesting that IGF-II may be a potential therapeutic agent to enhance placental growth. In guinea pigs, maternal treatment with IGF-I or IGF-II, in early to mid pregnancy, has sustained anabolic effects on fetal growth, enhanced fetal survival and increased placental delivery, and fetal and maternal utilization of, glucose and amino acids near term. These effects were also evident by mid gestation following earlier IGF-I treatment. Despite these similar pregnancy outcomes, there were IGF specific effects on the placenta and mother, suggesting that IGFs may mediate some of their effects via different pathways. IGF-I administration severely reduced maternal adiposity in late pregnancy, elicited its effects by substantially improving development of the placental exchange region, which correlated with placental function. We have suggested that the discrete effects of IGF-I and IGF-II stem from distinct interactions of the IGFs with various receptors. Maternal administration of an analogue of IGF-II that selectively interacts with IGF2R (Leu &#178;&#8311;-IGF-II), revealed that many of the effects of IGF-II treatment, were mediated by IGF2R, while IGF-I presumably acts through IGF1R. Together, this work has highlighted the major and somewhat complementary roles of maternal IGFs during the first half of pregnancy, in regulating placental development, fetal growth and pregnancy success. Importantly, it indicates the potential use of maternal IGFs in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to pregnancy complications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Somatomedin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influences on the sorption affinity of soil organic matter for non-ionic organic pollutants.</field><field name="creator">Ahangar, Ahmad G.</field><field name="description">Sorption of non-ionic organic compounds to organic matter is usually characterized as a partitioning interaction, which is quantified by K [subscript]oc, the organic-C normalized partitioning coefficient. However K [subscript]oc for any single compound varies considerably between soils, often by a factor of 3-10. This study addresses some of the potential causes of this variability. Forty-four soil cores were collected from a 2 ha paddock. Ten of these cores were selected for sorption measurements. The chemical composition of the soil organic matter (SOM) was determined using &#185;&#179;C NMR analysis. It was found that K [subscript]oc for diuron was positively correlated with aryl C (r&#178; = 0.59) and negatively correlated with O-alkyl C (r&#178; = 0.84). There were no such correlations for phenanthrene K [subscript]oc. A second set of experiments was carried out to investigate the effects of SOM&#8211; mineral interactions on the sorption properties of a selection of the soils. It was found that HF-treatment increased K [subscript]oc for both phenanthrene and diuron. The HF treatment removes mineral matter leaving the organic phase unaffected by the treatment. The increase in K [subscript]oc on HF-treatment soils provides strong evidence that interactions between organic matter and soil minerals block organic matter sorption sites. Furthermore, following HF-treatment, there was a positive correlation between K [subscript]oc for phenanthrene and aryl C and carbonyl C and a negative correlation with O-alkyl C. This suggests that the non-constancy of the relationship between organic matter chemistry and K [subscript]oc, for whole soils in the case of phenanthrene, may be a consequence of variability of the effect of organic matter-mineral interactions on K [subscript]oc. The influence of lipids on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene to soils was also investigated. Lipids are known to cover the surfaces of organic matter in soil. K [subscript]oc for diuron and phenanthrene were consistently higher for the lipid-extracted soils than for the whole soils (average of 31% for diuron and 29% for phenanthrene), indicating that lipids block sorption sites on the organic matter. Sorption experiments on one pair of HF-treated soils indicated that the blocking effects of minerals and lipids are independent, because lipid extraction and HF-treatment combined increased K [subscript]oc by more than either treatment alone. In the last experiment, the effect of solvent conditioning on the sorption of diuron and phenanthrene was investigated. The K [subscript]oc values for compounds were consistently higher for solvent-treated whole soil and lipid-extracted soil than corresponding soils before solvent treatment. Solid-state &#185;&#179;C NMR spectra of the solvent-treated soils indicated that there were no significant changes in the chemical structure of SOM caused by solvent treatment. Solvent treatment changes the physical conformation of the SOM, increasing its sorption affinity. The key findings from the research are: &#8226;	Variations in sorption affinity for diuron are related to differences in the soil organic matter chemistry. &#8226;	SOM-mineral interactions can have a substantial influence on K [subscript]oc for non- ionic compounds. &#8226;	Lipids may block the active sorption sites on the SOM thereby diminishing sorption overall. &#8226;	Solvent conditioning can change the physical conformation of SOM and lead to enhancement sorption of diuron and phenanthrene.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sorption; Non-ionic organic pollutant; Soil sorption affinity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of antibody, complement and immune complexes as mediators of immune-injury</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Ian James</field><field name="description">In guinea-pig nephrotoxic nephritis (NTN) induced by a sheep antibody there was minimal glomerular capillary deposition of C3 or accumulation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMN) in the heterologous phase. The C4 deficient (C4d) strain developed the same injury as normal Dunkin-Hartley animals. Complement depletion with cobra venom factor, PMN depletion with nitrogen mustard or anti-PMN serum and treatment with antihistamines, aprotinin and indomethacin provided no protection. The relationship between the dose of nephrotoxic antibody and the proteinuria was similar for the &#947;1 and &#947;2 subclasses and the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of &#947;1 antibody. However, the F(ab&#8217;) and the F(ab) antibody fragments, though fixing on the GBM did not cause proteinuria. It is Concluded that the development of proteinuria in this system: is largely independent of the C/PMN system; is due to the fixation of the F(ab&#8217;)2 fragment of the antibody molecule; and does not depend on an intact Fc piece. In the autologous phase of NTN induced by sheep antibody to GBM in DH and C4d strain gp, &lt;50% of animals developed proteinuria at the height of the autologous antibody response despite high anti-sheep immunoglobulin titres and fixation of the gp IgG and complement in the kidneys. Only 2 of 37 animals (5.4%) developed progressive disease. In a passive model of autologous phase injury using high titre rabbit antibody to sheep IgG, proteinuria failed to occur despite fixation of up to 95&#181;g of rabbit antibody per kidney. Repeated injection of sheep nephrotoxic antibody caused a persisting nephritic syndrome but not the characteristic proliferative lesion of anti-GBM diseases in other species. Because antibody responses to the alternative complement pathway activator cobra venom factor, are T-dependent and B-mice therefore do not develop resistance to its action it was possible to examine whether renal injury occured under circumstances of protracted alternative pathway activation. After periods of up to three months, no evidence from measurements of blood urea or proteinuria or from examination with light microscopy, immunofluorescent or electron microscopy was obtained to indicate a direct nephrotoxic effect of this type of complement activation. These studies do not support the concept that glomerular injury in patients with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis and hypocomplementaemia from C3 nephritic factor are due to the continued activation of the alternative pathway. The clinical course and levels of anti-GBM antibody were compared in 20 patients with Goodpasture&#8217;s syndrome treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression (8 patients), immunosuppression alone (4patients) or no specific therapy (8 patients). There was a more rapid fall in the level of anti-GBM antibody and pulmonary haemorrhage was less protracted in the patients treated with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. In this group, one patient who presented with severe renal failure showed a marked improvement in renal function and there was no progression of disease in the four with milder renal involvement. Two of the four patients treated with immunosuppression alone and only two of the eight patients who received no specific therapy maintained normal renal function. In the group which received no specific therapy, one of the six patients who progressed to renal failure had mild renal involvement initially. There was a significant correlation between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of the morphological changes seen at renal biopsy but not between the level of anti-GBM antibody and the severity of lung haemorrhage. The course and outcome of the disease in these patients not treated or treated with immunosuppression alone was better than that described in earlier reports of this disease, while those patients with plasma exchange and immunosuppression fared even better. An adequately stratified controled trial of immunosuppression in plasma exchange versus immunsuppression alone is justified. Immune complex (IC) levels were measured in normal subjects using the C1q solid phase, C1q deviation, C1q binding and polyethylene glycol precipitation assays. Significant changes in IC levels were seen in normals with each of the assays but the pattern of variation was not consistent between assays or subjects or in the same subject from day to day. There were no consistent changes with meals, time of day, exercise or the prior administration of prednisone. Low levels of IC appeared to be normal in plasma, but the variation in IC levels was not explained. Normal IC may well comprise mixtures of non-specific immunoglobulin aggregates, rheumatoid factor-immunoglobulin complexes, idiotype anti-idiotype complexes as well as specific antibody complexes with antigens from food, infective agents and other sources. Eighty-six patients with primary glomerulonephritis had circulating IC levels measured in 4 IC assays at the time of percutaneous renal biopsy. Patients with acute glomerulonephritis and type 1 mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis showed the greatest positivity rate overall while patients with membranous glomerulonephritis had the lowest rate. overall, just over half the patients with primary glomerulonephritis were positive in any one assay and &lt;5% in any three assays. Repeat samples taken from the same patients after an interval of some months often showed the same pattern of reactivity in the 4 assays or a return towards lower values. Thirty-one patients with proven acute myocardial infarction (MI) were studied prospectively at the time of admission to hospital and at 3, 7, and 18 days using 4 IC assays. Each assay showed an increased incidence of IC activity in MI with 76% of patients being Positive in at least one assay on one or more of the sampling days. A positive IC assay did not show a significant correlation with cardiac failure, pericarditis, post MI syndrome or previous infarction. The presence of IC was found to correlate with serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum enzymes and ESR and suggested that complexed CRP or other acute phase proteins may account for some of the IC activity found with less specific assays. The measurement of IC levels in MI has not proved helpful in the diagnosis, management or prediction of outcome in this disorder. In recipients of cadaveric renal transplants circulating IC as detected by the C1q deviation test were found in more than two thirds of patients with recent graft. IC levels were found to rise after rejection episodes and also after episodes of infection. Low or rapidly falling IC levels soon after transplantation were associated with good graft function. Sera from 4 patients with systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE) were shown to contain abnormal lipoproteins which behaved as IC. One IC lipoprotein (ICVLDL) had the density in ultracentrifugation of very low density lipoprotein, but a markedly altered electrophoretic mobility. A second IC lipoprotein (ICIDL) had the electrophoretic mobility of very low density lipoprotein but was slightly denser than low density lipoprotein on ultracentrifugation. Both the ICVLDL and ICLDL contained IgG and behaved as IC in the C1q deviation test, platelet aggregation and rheumatoid factor inhibition assays, but not in the conglutinin and C1q binding assays and the C1q solid phase assays. These differences could be due to the low densities of the ICVLDL and ICLDL. The abnormal lipoprotein IC disappeared with clinical remission in two patients and were not present in the sera of other patients with inactive or mild SLE, type 4 hyperlipidaemia or during prednisone therapy or plasma exchange for other conditions. These IC appeared to be markers of severe and active SLE.</field><field name="date">1984</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reflecting diversity or selecting viewpoints : an analysis of the GM debate in New Zealand's media 1998-2002 : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of PhD in Communication at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ashwell, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The advent of genetically modified (GM) food in New Zealand in 1998 saw the beginning of a highly politicised debate about GM use in the country. The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adjusting the parameter estimation of the parentage analysis software MasterBayes to the presence of siblings : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Statistics at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Heller, Florian</field><field name="description">Parentage analysis is concerned with the estimation of a sample&#8217;s pedigree structure, which is often essential knowledge for estimating population parameters of animal species, such as reproductive success. While it is often easy to relate one parent to an offspring simply by observation, the second parent remains frequently unknown. Parentage analysis uses genotypic data to estimate the pedigree, which then allows inferring the desired parameters. There are several software applications available for parentage analysis, one of which is MasterBayes, an extension to the statistical software package R. MasterBayes makes use of behavioural, phenotypic, spatial and genetic data, providing a Bayesian approach to simultaneously estimate pedigree and population parameters of interest, allowing for a range of covariate models. MasterBayes however assumes the sample to be a randomly collected from the population of interest. Often however, collected data will come from nests or otherwise from groups that are likely to contain siblings. If siblings are present, the assumption of a random population sample is not met anymore and as a result, the parameter variance will be underestimated. This thesis presents four methods to adjust MasterBayes&#8217; parameter estimate to the presence of siblings, all of which are based on the pedigree structure, as estimated by MasterBayes. One approach, denoted as DEP, provides a Bayesian estimate, similar to MasterBayes&#8217; approach, but incorporating the presence of siblings. Three further approaches, denoted as W1, W2 and W3, apply importance sampling to re-weight parameter estimates obtained from MasterBayes and DEP. Though fully satisfying adjustment of the estimate&#8217;s variance is only achieved at nearly perfect pedigree assignment, the presented methods do improve MasterBayes&#8217; parameter estimation in the presence of siblings considerably, when the pedigree is uncertain. DEP and W3 show to be the most successful adjustment methods, providing comparatively accurate, though yet underestimated variances for small family sizes. W3 is the superior approach when the pedigree is highly uncertain, whereas DEP becomes superior when about half of all parental assignments are correct. Large family sizes introduce to all approaches a tendency to underestimate the parameter variance, the degree of underestimation depending on the certainty of pedigree. Additionally, the importance sampling schemes provide at large uncertainty of pedigree comparatively good estimates of the parameter&#8217;s expected values, where the non importance sampling approaches severely fail.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Statistical analysis</field><field name="subject">Animal pedigrees</field><field name="subject">Population parameters</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230200 Statistics::230204 Applied statistics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gold nanoparticles for biosensor development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the degree of Doctor of Philosphy in Chemistry, Institute of Fundamental Science, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xiuqian</field><field name="description">Gold nanoparticles, are one of the most widely investigated nanoparticles (NP) and are normally synthesized by the reduction of metal salts in citrate solution. The reason for studying this nanostructured material from a technological standpoint is mainly the anticipated application in different areas based on optical properties explained with plasmon resonance. The main work of this study was to develop different sensing systems using gold nanoparticles. Three techniques have been utilized, being lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). A one-step semi-quantitative LFIA strip test was developed using colloidal gold coated by a partially-purified polyclonal antibody (pAb) raised in sheep as a signal generator, and bovine serum albumin-Estriol-16-glucuronide (BSA-E3-16G) conjugates as the capture agent spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane as the test line. In this system, gold nanoparticles were applied for visualising the response. The application of the strip sensor to urinary samples from pregnant woman proved successful. A quantitative evaluation of low levels of E3-16G in liquid media was developed based on SPR, which used the same pAb-nanogold conjugates employed for the LFIA analysis. The assay can be carried out directly on any urine samples without sample pretreatment. In this system, gold nanoparticles were utilized as high mass label to improve the sensitivity of the assay. A SERS probe was developed which comprised of Raman reporter molecules (RRM) and gold NPs. Results showed that the conducting polymer materials of 3&#8217;-[(E)-2-(4-R-phenyl)ethenyl]-2&#8217;2&#8217;:5&#8217;,2&#8221;-terthiophene (R-pe3T, where R is NO2 or NH2) showed significant enhancement.

The emergence of the sustainability concept has seen a concomitant rise in the interest of its measurement. It has been suggested that through the analysis of regulatory and non-regulatory methods, the attainment of how sustainable freshwater use in vineyards can be assessed. Regulation has to date been the policy tool of choice in regards to environmental protection. While regulation is often necessary, non-regulatory approaches may, in some circumstances, serve as useful supplements to an effective regulatory regime. There are a number of stages to achieving the aim of this research. The first is designed at galvanising New Zealand&#8223;s will to stride out down the sustainability road through the development of the sustainable vineyard concept. Investigations into regulatory freshwater policies were undertaken to assess the relative efficacy of such methods in guiding vineyards in sustainable freshwater use. The research then explored the elements of freshwater use as they relate to non-regulatory methods for achieving sustainable environmental outcomes. Qualitative research was undertaken through the instigation of an email questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to provide an understanding of freshwater use in vineyards within Marlborough. The research focuses on the discussion of the methodological considerations which are important in developing a working framework for assessing how vineyards achieve sustainable freshwater use. The ideal properties and characteristics of sustainability are identified and critically examined. An evaluation of the different types of regulatory and non-regulatory policies on freshwater management are considered. Both regulatory and non-regulatory methods were seen to be significant in developing an operational framework, as they are capable of representing the management of freshwater use and sustainability practices in vineyards. It is observed that the policy goal of both regulatory and non-regulatory organisations in achieving sustainable freshwater outcomes generally cannot be attained to the full satisfaction of all the dimensions of sustainability. Rather, sustainable freshwater use could be considered as a &#8222;road&#8223; and not a fixed destination. Along the way, trade-offs and balances have to be made. It is up to individual vineyard managers to weight the various alternatives, with the policy and decision makers providing information upon which rational choices can be based. This research demonstrates the efficacy of regulatory and non-regulatory methods in guiding sustainable environmental outcomes. It appears that the &#8222;ideals&#8223; of policies, as outlined in the literature and data collected, recommend an overall adaptive management approach if achieving sustainable freshwater use is the ultimate goal.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable water use</field><field name="subject">Sustainable vineyards</field><field name="subject">Sustainable winegrowing</field><field name="subject">Marlborough vineyards</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300903 Sustainable development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparing theoretical analyses of student learning of science: the case of chemistry in a year 7 classroom</field><field name="creator">Xu, Li Hua</field><field name="description">This study sought to address two connections that are fundamental to studies of science teaching and learning in classroom settings. The first one is the connection between classroom instruction and student learning outcomes, and the second one is the relationship between theoretical choice and analytical results. In this study, two theoretical perspectives were employed in parallel to examine a sequence of nine lessons on the topic of &#8220;Matter&#8221; in a Year 7 science classroom. These two theoretical perspectives are: Distributed Cognition (Hutchins, 1995) and Variation Theory (Marton and Tsui, 2004). The results of each analysis were compared and contrasted in an attempt to identify their similarities and differences in describing and explaining the classroom practice documented.The analyses from both theoretical lenses pointed to several issues underlying student difficulties identified in this classroom, including the problematic macroscopic-microscopic relationship, the lack of attention to &#8220;substance&#8221;, and the taken-for-granted temperature conditions. However, the two theoretical perspectives differed in their capacity to accommodate learning at different levels, to address the connection between instruction and learning, and to identify and advocate the likely benefits of particular instructional approaches. Distributed Cognition unfolded the connection between teaching and learning by a careful examination of social interactions and the utilization of artefacts in these interactions. It speculated learning occurring in different types of social configurations and interactions found in a science classroom (e.g. collaborative activities). From the perspective of Distributed Cognition, the inappropriate employment or coordination of resources was the key factor contributing to the limited success in establishing shared understanding among the participants in the classroom. Variation Theory explicitly modelled the connection between instruction and learning through the idea of patterns of variation, and it provided some general principles to evaluate the teaching of a specific topic. From the perspective of Variation Theory, it was the lack of appropriate variation in the key attributes of the object of learning that contributed to the limited success in developing student capability to make differentiations between critical and uncritical aspects of a scientific concept. But current applications of Variation Theory do not include learning occurring in the private domain of the classroom (e.g. student-student interaction) and are silent on the role of collaborative activity (e.g. group work) in learning.The juxtaposition of the parallel analyses showed that the two theories are complementary and mutually informing in their explanations of the documented classroom practice. But their assumptions about what constitutes learning and what contributes to that learning differed from each other. This study suggested that we should focus our attention on the identification of the contingencies of compatibilities in our efforts to combine or synthesize elements of different theories. In this study, the local combination of the results generated from the parallel analyses contributed to a more complete understanding of science learning as it occurred in the classroom.The findings of this study should inform science teaching, curriculum development, and instructional design of science classrooms. It also generated implications for research into science classrooms and suggested the need for the science education community to examine the role of theory and the relationship between theoretical choice and analytical results obtained through the employment of a particular theory.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education, classroom research, student learning, distributed cognition, variation theory</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mysticism of John Saba</field><field name="creator">Colless, Brian Edric</field><field name="description">This edition and translation of some of the mystical discourse of the eighth-century Nestorian monk John of Dalyatha is an attempt to fill part of the gap that exists in our knowledge of Syrian Christian mysticism.</field><field name="date">1969</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mysticism, spirituality, Syriac Christians, John of Dalyatha, 8th century</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The education of women in England 1650-1750: changes in ideas and pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Scott, Catherine Elizabeth Margaret</field><field name="description">The period 1650 to 1750 in England saw the development of small but positive changes in the education of women and girls.  Increasingly, various writers began to argue that more attention and resources needed to be devoted to the way in which girls were taught. Although the accepted curriculum of religion, various kinds of needlework,  reading, household management, music, dancing, history and French was not seriously questioned, there were attempts  by authors such as Charles Rollin and Archbishop Fenelon of Cambrai to write schemes of study that taught these skills and topics in a more rigorous and interesting manner.  A key development was the entry of women into the discussion, with writers such as Mary Astell and Bathusa Makin arguing for the need of better schools and a richer, more serious curriculum for girls.  As this thesis is focused as much as possible on actual teaching practices as well as shifts in ideology,  changes in the way Primers and Spelling books, which were used by mothers and governesses as aids to teach young children to read  are also examined. Increasingly, there was a recognition of the need for intelligent girls to be stretched and of the danger to the household of badly educated mothers and wives. Female authors expressed their frustration with the limited education offered to girls. This thesis examines a range of authors and texts, including the fictional work of Sarah Fielding, the personal records left by eighteenth- century governess Nelly Weeton and discussions which took place in newspapers such as the Spectator, in order to tease out and illustrate the development of these changes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education, England, girls, 1650-1750</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-speed optical transmission system using coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing</field><field name="creator">Tang, Yan</field><field name="description">Recently, Coherent Optical Orthogonal Frequency-division Multiplexing (CO-OFDM) has been considered as a promising technology for high-speed optical transmission due to its easiness of dispersion compensation, high optical spectral efficiency and superior scalability over the channel dispersion and data rate.

This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Delineating the source, geochemical sinks and aqueous mobilisation processes of naturally occurring arsenic in a coastal sandy aquifer</field><field name="creator">O???Shea, Bethany Megan, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Elevated arsenic concentrations have been reported in a drinking water and irrigation-supply aquifer of Stuarts Point, New South Wales, Australia. Arsenic occurrence in such aquifers is potentially a major issue due to their common use for high yield domestic and irrigation water supplies. Ten multi-level piezometers were installed to depths of approximately 30 m in the sand and clay aquifer. Sediment samples were collected at specific depths during drilling and analysed for chemical and mineralogical composition, grain size characteristics, potential for arsenic release from solid phase and detailed microscopic features. From this data, a full geomorphic reconstruction allowed the determination of source provenance for the aquifer sediments. The model proposed herein provides evidence that the bulk of the aquifer was deposited under intermittent fluvial and estuarine conditions; and that all sediments derive from the regional arsenicmineralised hinterland. More than 200 groundwater samples were collected and analysed for over 50 variables. The heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments causes redox stratification to occur, which in turn governs arsenic mobility in the groundwater. The bulk of the aquifer is composed of fluvial sand deposits undergoing reductive dissolution of iron oxides. Arsenic adsorbed to iron oxide minerals is released during dissolution but re-adsorbs to other iron oxides present in this part of the aquifer. The deeper, more reducing fluvial sand and estuarine clay groundwaters have undergone complete reductive dissolution of iron oxides resulting in the subsequent mobilisation of arsenic into groundwater. Some of this arsenic has been incorporated into iron sulfide mineral precipitates, forming current arsenian pyrite sinks within the aquifer. The extraction of groundwater from the aquifer for irrigation and drinking water supply induces seawater intrusion of arsenic-rich estuarine water, bringing further dissolved arsenic into the aquifer. A greater understanding of the source, sinks and mobilisation of arsenic in this aquifer contributes to our broad understanding of arsenic in the environment; and allows aquifer specific management procedures and research recommendations to be made. Any coastal or unconsolidated aquifer that has sediments derived from mineralised provenances should consider monitoring for arsenic, and other potentially toxic trace elements, in their groundwater systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater - New South Wales - Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of Australian catholic social welfare, 1920-1985</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Damian John, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the neglected history of Australian Catholic social welfare, focusing on the period, 1920-85. Central to this study is a comparative analysis of diocesan welfare bureaux (Centacare), especially the Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide agencies. Starting with the origins of professional welfare at local levels, this thesis shows the growth in Catholic welfare services across Australia. The significant transition from voluntary to professional Catholic welfare in Australia is a key theme. Lay trained women inspired the transformation in the church???s welfare services. Prepared predominantly by their American training, these women devoted their lives to fostering social work in the Church and within the broader community. The women demonstrated vision and tenacity in introducing new policies and practices across the disparate and unco-ordinated Australian Catholic welfare sector. Their determination challenged the status quo, especially the church???s preference for institutionalisation of children, though they packaged their reforms with compassion and pragmatism. Trained social workers offered specialised guidance though such efforts were often not appreciated before the 1960s. New approaches to welfare and the co-ordination of services attracted varying degrees of resistance and opposition from traditional Catholic charity providers: religious orders and the voluntary-based St Vincent de Paul Society (SVdP). For much of the period under review diocesan bureaux experienced close scrutiny from their ordinaries (bishops), regular financial difficulties, and competition from other church-based charities for status and funding. Following the lead of lay women, clerics such as Bishop Algy Thomas, Monsignor Frank McCosker and Fr Peter Phibbs (Sydney); Bishop Eric Perkins (Melbourne), Frs Terry Holland and Luke Roberts (Adelaide), consolidated Catholic social welfare. For four decades an unprecedented Sydney-Melbourne partnership between McCosker and Perkins had a major impact on Catholic social policy, through peak bodies such as the National Catholic Welfare Committee and its successor the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. The intersection between church and state is examined in terms of welfare policies and state aid for service delivery. Peak bodies secured state aid for the church???s welfare agencies, which, given insufficient church funding proved crucial by the mid 1980s.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church charities -- Australia -- Catholic Church -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social workers -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Volunteer workers in social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Professions -- Social aspects -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems</field><field name="creator">O???Connell, Amanda Elizabeth, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the effects of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems. After a midgestational asphyxial episode in fetal sheep (30 min total umbilical cord occlusion at 90 days; term 150 days) the hydrops that resulted had not completely resolved by 130 days. While the heart and kidneys were apparently unaffected, the brain and lung weights were 37% and 50% lower than sham values, respectively and there were joint contractures. The effects of maternal renal disease on the offspring were investigated. Although in utero fetuses of subtotally nephrectomised ewes (STNx) had altered urine flow rates, sodium excretion, haematocrits, plasma chloride and plasma renin levels, by 1-2 weeks after birth these values in the lambs (STNxL) were similar to controls (ConL) under baseline conditions. Body weight and the weights of most organs were similar, including the kidney, in which glomerular number was normal. In the neonatal period, the lambs were subjected to four challenges: furosemide (2 mg/kg intravenous bolus), infusion of angiotensin II and phenylephrine, intravenous infusion of 0.15M saline (50 ml/kg over 30 min) and haemorrhage (20% estimated blood volume over 10 min). These challenges revealed evidence of programming of several aspects of the renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems in the STNx offspring. As young adults at 6 months of age, male and female offspring of STNx ewes were normotensive and had normal renal function. On a high salt diet (HSD, 0.17M NaCl in 8L water for 5-7days), female offspring of both groups did not become hypertensive. However, the STNx offspring must have retained salt and water as plasma sodium was increased and haematocrit was decreased. In the STNx offspring only, there was a relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mean arterial pressure, indicating an inability to maintain a constant GFR in response to changes in arterial pressure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatology</field><field name="subject">Fetus - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">Renin-angiotensin system</field><field name="subject">Kidneys</field><field name="subject">Sheep- Embryos</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of personality on responses to stressors: an examination of the Grossarth-Maticek personality inventory</field><field name="creator">Caponecchia, Carlo, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Grossarth-Maticek and colleagues presented longitudinal evidence for personality Type being related to disease. Type 1s (cancer prone) and Type 2s (CHD prone) were proposed to be dependent on others, in contrast to the autonomous Type 4s, who had a lower mortality rate at follow-up. Stress was the mechanism proposed to account for the effects of personality on disease, yet this claim has not been systematically investigated. Four studies compared responses of Type 1, 2 and 4 individuals to stress and non-stress tasks. Types 1 and 2 showed increased salivary cortisol responses to an uncontrollable maths stress task (relative to control) compared to Type 4s, and scored higher on perceived stress, state-anxiety, and measures of negative mood, consistent with the implications of the Grossarth-Maticek hypothesis. No significant differences were evident between the Types in response to progressive muscle relaxation, suggesting stress is necessary for Type differences to emerge. Further, Types 1 and 2 responded differently to different stressors (maths vs. exam), arguing against criticisms that Types 1 and 2 are indistinguishable. The relation between Grossarth-Maticek Type subscales was further clarified through their correlations with each other (controlling for mood, stress and social desirability), and with the Lifestyle Defense Mechanisms (LDM) inventory, a psychometric refinement of the Grossarth-Maticek scales. A prospective study examining mortality rates in a sample exposed to environmental noise stressors revealed no prediction of death or cause of death by Grossarth-Maticek Type. This may have been due to the relative youth of the sample, short (7 year) follow-up period, and consequently low death rate. The current research is the first to show different responses to different stressors between Types 1 and 2, and revealed converging evidence for the claim that stress is the mechanism for Type effects on disease. Additionally, theoretical issues in conceptions of stress, and models of the relation between the Types, stress and disease were considered. This project suggests that after a history of criticisms, the Grossarth-Maticek typology should be re-considered for its public health implications, and along with the LDM inventory, should be considered for further investigation of the relation between personality variables and disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Personality tests</field><field name="subject">diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/29374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct shear behaviour of steel fibres in a cementitious matrix.</field><field name="creator">Lee, Gregory G, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation into the direct shear behaviour of steel fibre reinforced composites utilising discrete fibres at pre-defined angles and fibres randomly distributed is described. The direct shear tests encompassed the complete range of loading from its initial application to failure of the double L-shaped push-off specimens. Hooked-ended and straight steel fibres were used in the tests with the fibres oriented at angles of ??75??, ??60??, ??45??, ??30??, ??15?? and 0?? with respect to a plane normal to the loading direction. The embedment lengths of the fibres, related to the total fibre length lf , each side of the shear plane were 0.5lf :0.5lf and 0.25lf :0.75lf . In addition to the single fibre tests, tests were conducted on randomly oriented steel fibre reinforced composites with fibre volumes of 0.005, 0.010, 0.015, and 0.020 with hooked-ended and straight steel fibres.  In addition to the tests outlined above, a series of non-destructive tests employing radiographic techniques was carried out to produce photographic images of events taking place of fibres pulling out from a cementitious element. The tests consisted of hooked-ended steel fibres oriented at angles of -60??, -30??, 0??, +30?? and +60?? to the cracking plane and straight fibres oriented at angles of -60??, 0?? and +60??. The non destructive technique allowed the internal behaviour occurring within the specimen along the shear plane to be investigated without impacting on the direct shear tests.  The angle of the fibre to the interface plane is an important parameter in determining the behaviour of the fibres under load and for the mode of failure; viz fibre pullout or fibre fracture. The effect of the end hook on behavioural aspects becomes increasingly less significant for more acute fibre angles where bending and snubbing effects become increasingly influential on the load versus displacement behaviour and mode of failure.  Contrary to expectations, the fibre embedment length had little influence over the peak loads attained for the discrete fibre tests and, in a number of specimens, fibres pulled out from the longer embedded side. This observation is contrary to the generally accepted assumption that a fibre remains rigidly embedded on the long side and pulls out from short side. The traditional role that uniform bond stresses along a fibre length and friction have played in the description of fibre behaviour is not as significant as previously reported, other effects such as snubbing are more important in anchoring a fibre. Various models need to be revised with this observation in mind.  The experimental results and observations from the discrete hooked-ended and straight steel fibres investigation are incorporated in the development of a behavioural model, the Variable Engagement Model II (VEMII). The VEMII describes the behaviour of randomly oriented discontinuous steel fibre reinforced composites loaded in shear. The model is verified against a series of randomly distributed fibre reinforced mortar specimens carried out in this study. Two forms of models are analysed: 1) a model based on the observation of lumped shear stresses at the fibre hook and in the snubbing zone; and 2) a uniform fibre bond stress applied along the embedded part of the fibre. The lumped bond stress approach and the uniform approach were found to give reasonable comparisons with the test data for the hooked-ended fibres but were conservative for the straight fibres. The VEMII confirms the applicability of the uniform bond approach adopted by previous researchers even though it does not correspond to the observations of fibre pullout behaviour of single fibres. The VEMII model provides a versatile approach that can also be applied to hybrid fibre combinations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="subject">Fibers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The single source chemical vapour deposition of alkaline earth metal oxide thin films</field><field name="creator">Hill, Matthew Roland, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal oxide thin films are dynamic materials that have revolutionised the nature of semiconductor and electronic thin film devices. Recently, progress has stagnated in some aspects due to the increasingly complex deposition apparatus required, and the dearth of suitable precursor complexes of certain ???difficult??? metals. This thesis seeks to address both of these issues. The application of a precursor complex, Mg6(O2CNEt2)12 to the SSCVD of MgO thin films delivered the highest quality films ever reported with this technique. The resultant films were found to be of purely (111) orientation. Due to the nature of the precursor, the chemical reactions occurring at the surface during SSCVD growth result in a high growth rate, low flux environment and films of (111) orientation have been achieved without the amorphous underlayer. This finding has important implications for buffer layers in perovskite thin film devices. The unprecedented precursor chemistry has been used as a basis for the extremely high quality material produced, along with the unusual, yet beneficial structural morphology it possesses. A new range of barium complexes with single encapsulating ligands have been prepared for use in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of BaTiO3 thin films. A novel pathway to an unprecedented class of barium carbamates is reported, and also new dianionic bis ??-ketoesterates and their barium, strontium, and calcium analogues were synthesised. High resolution mass spectrometry showed the barium bis ??-ketoesterate derivatives to be monomeric, and preliminary testing indicated some volatility in these species. Insights were gained into the likely successful pathways to building a volatile heterobimetallic precursor complex containing an alkaline earth metal. The knowledge of intimate mixing in heterobimetallic precursor complexes was extended by some novel chemistry to develop the first mixed Zn/Mg carbamato cluster complexes. These complexes were found to be excellent SSCVD precursors for ZnxMg1-xO thin films. Thin films were deposited with these precursors and exhibited a single preferred orientation, with a constant amount of magnesium throughout the bulk of the films. Investigation of the light emission properties of the films revealed significant improvements in the structural order commensurate with the incorporation of magnesium, and the formation of the ZnxMg1-xO alloy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metal oxide semiconductors -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Chemical vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Alkaline earth metals</field><field name="subject">Thin films -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface grafting of polymers via living radical polymerization techniques; polymeric supports for combinatorial chemistry</field><field name="creator">Zwaneveld, Nikolas Anton Amadeus, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The use of living radical polymerization methods has shown significant potential to control grafting of polymers from inert polymeric substrates. The objective of this thesis is to create advanced substrates for use in  combinatorial chemistry applications through the use of g-radiation as a radical source, and the use of RAFT, ATRP and RATRP living radical techniques to control grafting polymerization. The substrates grafted were polypropylene SynPhase lanterns from Mimotopes and are intended to be used as supports for combinatorial chemistry. ATRP was used to graft polymers to SynPhase lanterns using a technique where the lantern was functionalized by exposing the lanterns to gamma-radiation from a 60Co radiation source in the presence of carbon tetra-bromide, producing short chain polystyrene tethered bromine atoms, and also with CBr4 directly functionalizing the surface. Styrene was then grafted off these lanterns using ATRP.  MMA was graft to the surface of SynPhase lanterns, using g-radiation initiated RATRP at room temperature. It was found that the addition of the thermal initiator, AIBN, successfully increased the concentration of radicals to a level where we could achieve proper control of the polymerization.  RAFT was used to successfully control the grafting of styrene, acrylic acid and N,N???-dimethylacrylamide to polypropylene SynPhase Lanterns via a -initiated RAFT agent mediated free radical polymerization process using cumyl phenyldithioacetate and cumyl dithiobenzoate RAFT agents.  Amphiphilic brush copolymers were produced with a novel combined RAFT and ATRP system. Polystyrene-co-poly(vinylbenzyl chloride) created using gamma-radiation and controlled with the RAFT agent PEPDA was used as a backbone. The VBC moieties were then used as initiator sites for the ATRP grafting of t-BA to give a P(t-BA) brush that was then hydrolyzed to produce a PAA brush polymer.  FMOC loading tests were conducted on all these lanterns to assess their effectiveness as combinatorial chemistry supports. It was found that the loading could be controlled by adjusting the graft ratio of the lanterns and had a comparable loading to those commercially produced by Mimotopes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ATRP</field><field name="subject">RAFT</field><field name="subject">Radiation</field><field name="subject">polymerization</field><field name="subject">grafting</field><field name="subject">living radical polymerization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/33361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of idealised image features in determining post-exposure body image and social comparisons</field><field name="creator">Aldridge, Fiona Jane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research examined the role that idealised image characteristics have in determining post-exposure body image and amount of self-reported social comparisons. This was tested by exposing female undergraduate students to media-portrayed idealised images that varied in their level of relevance, salience, or attainability. A negative impact of these images was indicated by greater post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation inaccuracy. In contrast, a positive impact was considered to have occurred when body dissatisfaction decreased and body size estimation was more accurate. If the images had a neutral impact on body image, one would expect little difference between groups or over time. A further aim was to determine whether a higher level of trait tendency to compare was related to more negative responding at post-exposure. In addition, thin ideal internalisation and restraint were examined as possible moderators. Studies 1, 2a, 2b, and 3 indicated that idealised image relevance and salience had little differential impact on post-exposure body image. That is, exposure to thin idealised images, irrespective of the salience and relevance manipulations, resulted in similar post-exposure body dissatisfaction and body size estimation. In contrast to this, the attainability of the image seemed to influence post-exposure responding, at least in terms of body size estimation (Study 4). Higher trait tendency to compare was associated with a greater amount of self-reported comparison with the images, but had little impact on body image. Surprisingly, these results were not moderated by thin ideal internalisation or restraint. The role of individual differences was explored with additional analyses in Study 5, which revealed that, when the power is sufficient, thin ideal internalisation, restraint, and self-reported comparisons with the images predicted post-exposure body dissatisfaction, but not body size estimation. Overall, this program of research suggests that idealised image features do not play a vital differential role in determining post-exposure body image, unless it is the body itself that is being manipulated. Results from this research support the idea that the mere presence of an idealised body is sufficient to activate negative responses, and there was little, if any, evidence for the occurrence of positive responses. These findings are discussed in terms of social comparison and schema theory, and in terms of their practical implications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">media portrayed idealised images</field><field name="subject">body image</field><field name="subject">social comparison theory</field><field name="subject">Social comparison</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dancing brush: an exploration of Taoist aesthetics</field><field name="creator">Yeh, Yi-Lan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dancing Brush video installation is dedicated to legendary Taiwanese dancer Tsai Jui-Yue (1921-2005) in the memory of her suffering, creativity and faith in life. This work reveals the true meaning of Chinese scroll paintings as an infinity of time and space. It draws on the notion of mobility as expounded in the I Ching or Book of Changes. Dancing Brush creates a modern cityscape where the principal of Taoism, ancient Chinese landscape painting, and calligraphy meet new media aesthetics. The focus of this thesis is to reassess media arts practice and aesthetics via the traditions of Chinese Taoist aesthetics. The research was conducted in three dimensions: ??non-linear aesthetics?? in Chinese arts as the new media art form, ??unity of emptiness and fullness?? as the animation principle, and ??subtraction aesthetics?? as the principle of creativity. I propose Dancing Brush video installation as a presentation of ??aesthetics of wandering contemplation??. The work suggests a feature of Chinese moving image aesthetics as a ??spatial montage?? form of media arts. I applied the Taoist ??decreative-creative process?? as the creative method in which the ??decreative?? process leads to the ??creative??. The ??decreative-creative process?? is based on the Taoist teachings of zi-ran (spontaneity) and wu-wei (non-action). I interpret it as ??subtraction aesthetics: less is more??. The process is to eliminate interferences with restricted narrative format and visual effects, then to receive the immediate presentation of things as pure materials. Through the subtracting process, it gains not less but more. Kong Bai (emptiness or formless) in Chinese art is the result of subtraction aesthetics. It reveals the creative principle derived from the Taoist idea of ??usefulness of useless??. The ??subtracting process?? in creating animation is to bring ??unknown?? to life. The ??image beyond image?? is the product of ??unity of emptiness and full?? where Chinese artistic realm yi-jing is created.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-linear aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Taoist Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">subtractions aesthetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42906</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Family Size and Relative Need</field><field name="creator">Bradbury, Bruce William, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines three questions concerned with the relative income needs of families of different sizes - often summarised by indices known as ???equivalence scales???. The first is the extent to which researchers and policy makers should offset the costs of family composition (eg the expenditure costs of children) with the benefits associated with demographic choice (eg the ???joys of parenthood???). Chapter 2 concludes that there are demographic and financial market constraints that will often make a narrow focus on expenditure costs appropriate for distributional research and tax/transfer policies. However, this will not always be the case. One implication of this result is that it may be reasonable for distributional research to use different equivalence scales for adults and children in the same household. Part 2 of the thesis introduces a new method for the estimation of the within-household income distribution and expenditure costs of different family types. This is based upon the household welfare model of Samuelson together with Lau???s method for modelling the joint consumption of household goods. In Chapter 4, this method is applied to the estimation of equivalence scales for older singles and married couples. The estimation is based upon a detailed set of assumptions about the extent of joint consumption for 17 different commodity groups. The main conclusions are that: the theoretical model fits the observed behaviour well (with the exception of some home production effects); that aged couples share their income relatively evenly; and that the relative rate of pension for aged singles in Australia is probably too low. In Part 3, the thesis examines how changes in poverty can be estimated when there is uncertainty about the equivalence scale. The thesis proposes a new method which permits a set of upper and lower bounds for the equivalence scale to be assumed, which in turn determine upper and lower bounds for the increase in poverty. This method is applied to measure the change in poverty in Australia during the 1980s. Equivalence scales can be found that imply either an increase or a decrease in poverty.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer equivalence scales</field><field name="subject">poverty</field><field name="subject">living standards</field><field name="subject">household welfare</field><field name="subject">intra-household allocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of arterial stiffness by angiotensin receptors and nitric oxide in the insulin resistance syndrome</field><field name="creator">Brillante, Divina Graciela, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin resistance syndrome [INSR] is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and affects up to 25% of the Australian population. The mechanism underlying the relationship between the INSR and increased cardiovascular risk is controversial. We postulated that perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system [RAS] and endothelium-derived NO may be implicated in the development of early vascular changes in the INSR.  Repeated measurements of arterial stiffness [using digital photoplethysmography] and haemodynamic parameters in response to vasoactive medications were used to demonstrate the functional expression of angiotensin II [Ang II] receptors and NO synthase [NOS].  Ang II acts via two main receptor sub-types: the Ang II type 1 [AT1] and Ang II type 2 [AT2] receptors. The AT1 receptor is central to the development of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. The role of AT2 receptors in humans is controversial but is postulated to counter-act AT1 receptor mediated effects in diseased vascular beds. We demonstrated increased AT1 and AT2 receptor-mediated effects in small to medium-sized arteries of subjects with early INSR [Chapter 6].  In addition, functional expression of AT2 receptors in adult insulin resistant humans [Chapter 5], but not in healthy volunteers [Chapter 4] was demonstrated. AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with early INSR resulted in improvements in vascular function, with a consequent functional down-regulation of AT2 receptors [Chapter 7].  Functional NOS expression was demonstrated to be increased in subjects with early INSR compared with healthy controls [Chapter 6]. This was postulated to be a homeostatic response to counteract early vascular changes in subjects with early INSR. AT1 receptor blockade in these subjects reduced functional NOS expression [Chapter 8].  In conclusion, patients with early INSR represent a model of early disease where early intervention may be able to reverse the process incited by the initial exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Early vascular changes in these individuals are mediated at least in part, by increased AT1 receptor activity and/or expression, and may be detected by changes in arterial stiffness indices and non-invasive vascular reactivity studies. There is a compensatory increase in AT2 receptor and NOS expression/activity to counter-act these vascular changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial stiffness.</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Angiotensin receptors.</field><field name="subject">AT1 receptor.</field><field name="subject">AT2 receptor.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment manager trading behaviour and performance</field><field name="creator">Looi, Adrian, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents an examination of the trading behaviour of active Australian fund managers. The thesis begins with an analysis of how fund manager trades relate to stock returns in the past, the present, and the future. The dissertation next proceeds to investigating how fund size affects fund performance, trading and portfolio construction. Finally, using earnings announcements as the locus for trading sequences, we analyse the nature of the information used by fund managers to predict stock returns.  This research is presented in the form of three essays. The first essay investigates how active fund manager trades relate to stock returns. Using a unique database of daily transactions from Australian equity managers, we document that our sample of institutional investors exhibit statistically and economically significant predictive power in forecasting future stock returns over the ten days following their trades. Furthermore, detailed analysis indicates that manager style is important in understanding the link between institutional trading and stock returns. The essay finds growth-oriented managers are momentum traders, while style-neutral and value managers are contrarian. Further, the contemporaneous relation between institutional trading and returns depends on trade size, broker use, and investment style. Finally, the study documents that trades and returns are inversely related for value/contrarian managers and directly related for style-neutral and growth managers.  The second essay presents an analysis of how fund size affects investment performance. Recent studies find evidence that small funds outperform large funds. This fund size effect is commonly hypothesized to be caused by transaction costs. Due to the lack of transactions data, prior studies have investigated the transaction costs theory only indirectly. This study however, analyses the daily transactions of active Australian equity managers and finds aggregate market impact costs incurred by large managers are significantly greater than that Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by package formation and portfolio characteristics consistent with transaction cost intimidation. An analysis of the interaction between transaction cost intimidation and the fund size effect documents that large managers pursue a highly active trading strategy, and accordingly suffer more from the fund size effect than is the case for large funds following a less active trading strategy. This suggests the fund size effect is related to transaction costs as trading activity is a good proxy for expected market impact.  Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by fund managers to trade. While a number of recent mutual fund performance studies find data, prior studies have investigated the transaction costs theory only indirectly. This study however, analyses the daily transactions of active Australian equity managers and finds aggregate market impact costs incurred by large managers are significantly greater than that Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by package formation and portfolio characteristics consistent with transaction cost intimidation. An analysis of the interaction between transaction cost intimidation and the fund size effect documents that large managers pursue a highly active trading strategy, and accordingly suffer more from the fund size effect than is the case for large funds following a less active trading strategy. This suggests the fund size effect is related to transaction costs as trading activity is incurred by small managers. Furthermore, large managers exhibit preferences for trade evidence of outperformance relative to suitably constructed benchmarks, limited research exists as to whether such outperformance is due to privately collected information, or merely expedient interpretation of publicly released information. In this essay an examination of the trade sequences of fund managers around earnings announcements is performed, and evidence is presented revealing an increased Occurrence of buy-sell trade sequences around good announcements and vice versa for bad announcements. The results also show an increase in the frequency of fund managers not trading before announcements, only to subsequently purchase during good announcements. Taken together, this evidence suggests managers are reliant on private information before earnings announcements, as well as them engaging in 'interpretation' of earnings announcements when they do not receive a private signal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business.</field><field name="subject">Managers.</field><field name="subject">Investments.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of cultural learning during the hospital briefing process from a facilities management perspective</field><field name="creator">Chandra, Venny, Centre for Health Assets Australasia, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The continued development of Facilities Management (FM) as a profession largely depends on it playing a stronger strategic role in the decision-making of organisations. This requires the capability of better understanding the clients' facility needs and requirements, which ultimately means that Facilities Managers must learn about the nature of clients' organisations and their organisational cultures. This study contends that in a project it is the briefing process that provides the greatest opportunity for cultural learning to occur, a process wherein it is important for the actors to converge upon shared understanding of facility needs and requirements. By focusing on culture at a cognitive rather than a behavioural level, this study has specifically attempted to identify the types of knowledge learned during a briefing process, to explore the process of cultural learning and the factors that encourage or impede such learning, and to produce an insight into the process.  A hospital partnering project was adopted as a case study for investigating the process of cultural learning during the briefing process. Using Nonaka's (1994) theory of Knowledge Creation, this study portrays the briefing process as one wherein the social processes during briefing facilitate the conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge in a cyclical way. Sackmann's (1991) categorisation of knowledge has been used to analyse the social interactions during briefing by dissecting the different levels of knowledge being shared. In support of the cognitive perspective of learning and the conceptual understanding of culture as mindsets or cognitions, Laukkanen's (1996) Comparative Cause Mapping method was used to measure the cultural learning occurring among members of both the FM and their clients' groups, using an in-depth inquiry into five key concepts during the briefing process. Data was collected longitudinally during the briefing process using real-time observations and semi-structured interviews which maximised the comparative measures of similarities and differences in the Cause Maps depicting cultural learning.  This integration of culture, learning, and briefing theories usmg Nonaka's (1994) knowledge creation theory, Sackmann's (1991) categorisation of knowledge, and Laukkanen's (1996) Comparative Cause Mapping method has produced interesting and useful insights into the process of cultural learning during the briefing process within a hospital partnering project. The study has found that significant cultural learning did take place during the briefing process and that partnering projects can present opportunities for this to occur. In particular, it is established that cultural learning is best conceived of as a process of social construction in which individuals, subgroups and groups engage in a collective approach to understanding facility needs and requirements. More specifically, briefing meetings were found to represent contexts for social interactions in which cultural learning took place. This learning occurred in constantly negotiated boundaries and through conflicts and disagreements, with actors competing in a dynamic process of social construction to have their version of understanding of the clients' needs and requirements prevail. The diverse client groups within the hospital context being studied provided a management opportunity for Facility Managers to act as 'mediators', which facilitated cultural learning. Finally, FM technical knowledge was shown to be an important tool for the FM group during the process of cultural learning as the participants negotiated their versions of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture.</field><field name="subject">Facility management.</field><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of multidrug transporters in childhood malignancies</field><field name="creator">Pajic, Marina, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the foremost causes of treatment failure in childhood malignancies. MDR is a multifactorial process, but classic resistance to cytotoxic drugs has most often been associated with over-expression of one or more MDR transporter proteins in malignant cells, conferring on them the ability to extrude an extraordinarily diverse array of endo- and xenobiotics out of the cell. The best characterized multidrug transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP), belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene superfamily, and have been previously implicated in the development of drug resistance in the clinical context. The work described herein examined the various aspects of the MDR genotype and phenotype in the childhood malignancies acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and neuroblastoma.  The first series of studies tested the hypothesis that morphine, a potential Pgp substrate, might influence the efficacy and/or toxicity of clinically used chemotherapy agents which are substrates for Pgp. The results, however, provided no evidence in a variety of human tumour cell lines of morphine influencing response to selected chemotherapeutic drugs. This finding is particularly important as morphine remains to be the opioid of choice for the treatment of cancer pain in the clinic.  The second series of studies examined the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MDR1 gene, encoding Pgp, and in the MRP1 gene, on patient outcome in childhood ALL or neuroblastoma, with a view to identifying novel prognostic markers for these malignancies. It was found that two of the examined SNPs in the MRP1 gene were associated with improved outcome in neuroblastoma, which had not previously been demonstrated in this disease. Moreover, each of the relevant MRP1 SNPs were associated with lower MRP1 gene expression in both patient samples and tumour cell lines, supporting previous studies indicating that low MRP1 expression in neuroblastoma is strongly associated with improved patient outcome. Importantly, the results of this study suggest a role for selected MRP1 polymorphisms in predicting clinical response in neuroblastoma.  Finally, a series of studies were undertaken, using both in vitro and in vivo model systems, to test the efficacy of putative small molecule inhibitors of the MRP1 gene and its transcriptional regulator, the MYCN oncogene, in neuroblastoma. These studies demonstrated for the first time the efficacy of a novel compound, 4H10, at reversing multidrug resistance either in cultured neuroblastoma cells, or in the MYCN transgenic mice, which develop neuroblastoma that closely mirror the human disease. The results indicate that inhibition of MRP1 function has potential clinical importance in the treatment of neuroblastoma, and therefore warrant further research in this area. In contrast, the results failed to provide evidence of the in vivo efficacy of the novel putative small molecule MYCN inhibitors analysed in these studies. Collectively, the findings of these studies contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of clinical drug resistance, and may help in the development of new approaches for risk assessment and treatment of aggressive childhood malignancies and thereby improve the long-term outlook of children diagnosed with these debilitating diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multidrug resistance.</field><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of inflammation-associated S100 proteins in fibroblasts and their expression in atherosclerosis</field><field name="creator">Rahimi, Ahmed Farid, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The multigene family of Ca2+-binding S100 proteins comprises 22 members that have various important intra- and extracellular roles. The three inflammation-associated members of this family???S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 (collectively termed &amp;quotcalgranulins&amp;quot)???are constitutive neutrophil and monocyte proteins also expressed by macrophages within acute and chronic inflammatory lesions, but not in tissue macrophages. They are expressed in human/murine wounds and by appropriately activated macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes in vitro. The &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot are implicated in leukocyte activation/deactivation, fatty acid transport, leukocyte/fibroblast chemotaxis, transmigration and adhesion, embryogenesis, wound healing, protection against oxidants and antibacterial defence. Chapter 3 of this thesis explores growth-factor- and cytokine-mediated regulation and expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in fibroblasts, and demonstrates spatio-temporal expression of S100A8 in rat dermal wounds. Fibroblasts are stromal resident cells with important regulatory immune-inflammatory functions in wound healing, tissue remodelling and fibrosis. Fibroblast migration, proliferation, differentiation and their synthetic repertoire are modulated by various factors including extracellular matrix components, growth factors, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and cytokines. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), interleukin-1?(IL-1? and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are potent fibroblast mitogens; PDGF and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-? are fibroblast chemoattractants. FGF-2 and IL-1?promote fibroblast proliferation, whereas TGF-?promotes myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon ?(IFN?, tumour-necrosis factor ? (TNF?, TGF-?and PDGF did not induce the S100A8 gene in fibroblasts whereas FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) maximally induced mRNA 12 hr. after stimulation and this declined over 36 hr. The FGF-2 response was strongly enhanced and prolonged by optimal levels of heparin (1-10 IU/ml), maximally at 18 hr. post-stimulation. FGF-2/heparin-induced responses depended on cell-cell contact in vitro. IL-1?(10 U/ml) alone, or in synergy with FGF-2/heparin strongly induced the gene in 3T3 and primary fibroblasts. Dexamethasone (10???6 M) enhanced LPS- and FGF-2/-IL-1?induced responses. S100A9 mRNA was not induced by any of these mediators. Induction of S100A8 in the absence of S100A9 was confirmed in primary fibroblast-like cells by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction. FGF-2-heparin- and IL-1?induced mRNA expression depended on de-novo protein synthesis and was partially mediated by the mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway of activation. Preliminary promoter deletion analyses indicated that FGF-2-responsive elements in the gene promoter were distinct from those responsive to IL-1? TGF-?(2 ng/ml) significantly suppressed gene induction mediated by FGF-2 ?heparin/LPS/dexamethasone, but not by IL-1? TGF-?may compromise mRNA stability. Protein levels in FGF-2-heparin-IL-1?stimulated fibroblasts correlated well with mRNA levels and expression was mainly cytoplasmic. Immunohistochemistry indicated S100A8 associated with keratinocytes, neutrophils, macrophage-like cells and some hair follicles in wounded rat skin. Rat wounds also contained numerous S100A8- positive fibroblast-like cells 2 and 4 days post-injury; numbers declined by 7 days. Upregulation of S100A8 by FGF-2/IL-1? down-regulation by TGF-? and time-dependent expression of S100A8 in wound fibroblasts suggest a role in fibroblast differentiation at sites of inflammation and repair. Intracellular fibroblast-derived S100A8 may also regulate intracellular redox equilibrium and antioxidant defence. Atherosclerosis is a progressive chronic disease with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. S100A1 and S100B are associated with dendritic cells and lymphocytes in experimental rodent and human atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes and macrophages in plaques of ApoE???/??? mice express S100A9 but not S100A8. Myeloperoxidase and HOClmediated oxidative mechanisms are fundamental in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and S100A8 is exquisitely sensitive to HOCl oxidation which generates sulphinamide bonds, novel non-reducible cysteine-lysine covalent bonds. Chapter 4 of this thesis presents novel evidence that, in contrast to the murine ApoE???/??? model, the three human &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot were expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques, but not in normal arteries. High levels of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were evident in macrophages and foam cells. Some neovessels were anti-S100A8-/anti-S100A9-immunoreactive; S100A9 staining was also evident on the extracellular matrix. Patterns of expression of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were overlapping in serial sections, except that only smooth muscle cells were S100A12-positive. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA were also expressed by macrophages, foam cells and endothelial cells, indicating gene up-regulation rather than passive protein uptake. Western blotting of plaque extracts revealed monomeric S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 and larger complexes. Some were resistant to reduction, suggesting non-disulfide covalent cross-linking, possibly via sulphinamide bonds. Stable S100A8-S100A9 complexes were also detected after immunoaffinity purification. In an in-vitro system, molar ratios of HOCl of &amp;gt1 generated stable complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 whereas ~800 and ~100-fold excess HOCl oxidises apolipoprotein B-100 and BSA, respectively. S100A8 and S100A9 protected low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against HOCl oxidation in a thiol-independent manner. Because HOCl-oxidised S100s did not contain epitopes recognised by an antibody used to detect HOCl-oxidised proteins in plaque, levels of oxidised proteins in plaque are likely to be significantly greater than described. S100A8 and S100A9 may protect LDL by functioning as HOCl-scavengers. However, chronic oxidative cross-linking of S100A8 and S100A9 with other proteins and extracellular matrix components may contribute to plaque pathogenesis. These studies support key roles for the &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot in chronic inflammation, wound healing and atherogenesis possibly by regulating cellular differentiation, activation and modulation of redox-dependent mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Calcium-binding proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activation of unsaturated N&#926;N, C=O, and C=C bonds using complexes of ruthenium and rhodium</field><field name="creator">Page, Michael John, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a broad range of coordination and organometallic chemistry on a series of ruthenium and rhodium complexes towards the aim of activating unsaturated N &#926; N, C=O, and C=C bonds.  The dinitrogen complex [RuTp(pzP)(N2)]BPh4 (5) (where Tp= tris(pyrazolyl)borate, and PzP= 1-(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)pyrazole) was synthesized via displacement of the chloride ligand from the complex [RuTp(pzP)Cl] (1). It was found that N2 coordination proceeded through an unusual oxidation/reduction cycle with the Ru(III) intermediate, [RuTp(pzP)CI]BF4 (6), isolated upon reaction of 1 with AgBF4 in THF. Investigations of the coordination chemistry of the related Tp complex [RuTp(Bp)PPh3] (4) (where Bp= bis(pyrazolyl)borate), resulted in several unusual reactions occurring on the Bp chelate. Reaction of 4 with AgBF4 gave the unusual product [RuTp(BpF')PPh3] (6), which had the Bp B-hydride substituents replaced by fluoride substituents from the BF4 anion, (i.e. BpF,). Alternatively, reaction of 4 with AgOTf, or SOCb, led to the synthesis of the products [RuTp(BpoH)PPh3]OTf (34), and [RuTp(BpoH)PPh3]Cl (35), respectively, which have a single hydroxyl substituent substituted in place of the two B-hydrides to yield a highly unusual neutral borane chelate (BpOH).  A series of ruthenium tris(pyrazolyl)methane (Tpm) complexes [RuTpm(PPh3)2Cl]BPh4  (44.BPh4) 	RuTpm(PPh3CI2]	(46),         [RuTpm(PPh3)2CI]BPh4 	            (44.BPh4) [RuTpm(PPh3)(MeCN)Cl]BPh4   (50),	          [RuTpm(PPh3HMeCN)](BF4)2        (51), [RuTpm(PPh3)(MeCNh](BF4)2 (52), and [RuTpm(MeCNhCI]BPh4 (54.BPh4) were synthesized. These complexes varied in the number of labile acetonitrile ligands they contained, the net charge of the complex, and the presence or absence of strongly coordinating phosphine coligands on the complex. The influence of these properties on the catalytic activity of the complexes for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated. It was shown that the net charge and number of labile MeCN donors on the complex had little influence on the activity of the catalyst. It was also observed that the catalyst [RuTpm(MeCN)2CI]BPh4 (54.BPh4), which does not contain a strongly coordinating PPh3 ligand, would rapidly decompose during catalysis.  A series of bis(tert-butylthiomethyl)pyridyl (SNS tBU ) pincer complexes [Ru(SNStBU)(PPh3)Cb] (65), [Ru(SN StBU)(PPh3)(MeCN)CI]BPh4 (66), [Ru(SNStBU)(PPh3)(MeCN)2](BF4h (67), and [Ru(SNStBU)(MeCN)Cb] (68) were synthesized and their as catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated. The activity of these complexes for as transfer hydrogenation catalysts was shown to increase as the number of labile coligands on the complex increased, with an extremely high transfer hydrogenation activity obtained using 68. The catalytic activity of 68 is one of the fastest to be reported in the literature, achieving a superlative TOF (turnover frequency) of 87360 h- I.  The coordination of SNStBu in 66 and the related complexes [Ru(SNS (MeCN)2CI]BPh4 (70), and [Ru(SNS)(MeCN)2CI]2[??-Ag(MeCN)2]2(BF4)4(71) was observed to yield a range of different conformational isomers. These isomers were studied in detail using low temperature NMR and 20 NOESY and COSY IH_1H correlation experiments. The complex 71 was also characterized crystallographically and was shown to have an unusual tetrametallic macrocyclic structure with two [Ru(SNS)(MeCN)2C1r moieties bridged by two [Ag(MeCN)2r ions through a chloro and thioether donor group.  The hydrogenation of unsaturated olefinic bonds was achieved using a series of Rh N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of the type [Rh(L)(COD)]BPh4 (where L= and NHC-pyrazolyl chelate). A series of NHC-pyrazoly ligands (L) were synthesized that contained varying degrees of steric bulk on the pyrazolyl and NHC donor group. The influence of these steric parameters on the rhodium complex structure and activity of the complexes as catalysts for the hydrogenation of styrene was investigated. It was found that increasing the steric bulk around Rh decreased the activity of the catalyst.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhodium.</field><field name="subject">Activation (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Ruthenium.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion. The findings from this thesis provide insights on tacit collusion in an oligopoly and policy implications from a learning perspective. With modelling flexibility, our co-evolutionary approach can be extended to study strategic behaviour in an oligopoly considering many other market characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Price fixing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Finance -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Oligopolies -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">3D imaging and modeling of carbonate core at multiple scales</field><field name="creator">Ghous, Abid, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The understanding of multiphase flow properties is essential for the exploitation of hydrocarbon reserves in a reservoir; these properties in turn are dependent on the geometric properties and connectivity of the pore space. The determination of the pore size distribution in carbonate reservoirs remains challenging; carbonates exhibit complex pore structures comprising length scales from nanometers to several centimeters. A major challenge to the accurate evaluation of these reservoirs is accounting for pore scale heterogeneity on multiple scales. This is the topic of this thesis.  Conventionally, this micron scale information is achieved either by building stochastic models using 2D images or by combining log and laboratory data to classify pore types and their behaviour. None of these capture the true 3D connectivity vital for flow characterisation. We present here an approach to build realistic 3D network models across a range of scales to improve property estimation through employment of X-ray micro-Computed Tomography (&#956;CT) and Focussed Ion Beam Tomography (FIBT). The submicron, or microporous, regions are delineated through a differential imaging technique undertaken on x-ray CT providing a qualitative description of microporosity. Various 3-Phase segmentation methods are then applied for quantitative characterisation of those regions utilising the attenuation coefficient values from the 3D tomographic images. X-ray micro-CT is resolution limited and can not resolve the detailed geometrical features of the submicron pores. FIB tomography is used to image the 3D pore structure of submicron pores down to a scale of tens of nanometers. We describe the experimental development and subsequent image processing including issues and difficulties resolved at various stages.  The developed methodology is implemented on cores from producing wackstone and grainstone reservoirs. Pore network models are generated to characterise the 3D interconnectivity of pores. We perform the simulations of petrophysical properties (permeability and formation resistivity) directly on the submicron scale image data. Simulated drainage capillary pressure curves are matched with the experimental data. We also present some preliminary results for the integration of multiscale pore information to build dual-scale network models. The integration of multiscale data allows one to select appropriate effective medium theories to incorporate sub-micron structure into property calculations at macro scale giving a more realistic estimation of properties.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Focussed Ion Beam Tomography (FIB)</field><field name="subject">Pore Network Model</field><field name="subject">X-ray micro Computed Tomography (CT)</field><field name="subject">Petrophysical Properties</field><field name="subject">Microporosity</field><field name="subject">Carbonate Reservoirs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF)  and Singapore&#146;s Industrial Relations</field><field name="creator">Gan, Kah Chun Bernard, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the formation, development, role and behaviour of the Singapore National Employers' Federation (SNEF). Its focus is primarily the field of labour management. It addresses key issues in the role of the SNEF from its formation in 1980 to 2004, in the institutional context of Singapore's politics, economic development and industrial relations. This longitudinal study makes a substantial original contribution to understanding Singapore's leading national employers' association, and is a pioneering study of a national employers' association in East Asia.  The thesis is a qualitative case-study, using fieldwork interviews, primary documents and the secondary literature as data sources. Through the critical event method, the work focuses analysis on key junctures for the SNEF's development and change during the period examined. In addition, the author employs the Sheldon and Thornthwaite (1999) model of employers' association strategy in framing the analysis of the thesis' central questions, and in examining SNEF's strategic decisions in response to changes in its external environment. By analysing how the SNEF's external roles and internal relations changed during each period, the research draws attention to the dynamic nature of this employers' association in the rapidly changing conditions marking Singapore's development. Given the central role of the People's Action Party (PAP) in Singaporean society, a central theme of this thesis is how the SNEF balances political pressures from Singapore's government-dominated corporatist system, with the needs of its diversified membership. The narrative core of the thesis identifies five distinct periods of Singaporean industrial relations - through the lens of the SNEF - reflecting larger economic developments through which the government guided the economy and society. The thesis finds that, while the SNEF is an independent and apolitical organisation, it is nevertheless deeply embedded in the Singaporean variant of corporatism. Accordingly, the SNEF's role and behaviour are inherently guided by the PAP's ideology of pragmatism and, in Singapore, sectoral interests deferred to and institutionally served national interests.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Employers' Association</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">Industrial Relations</field><field name="subject">SNEF</field><field name="subject">Corporatism</field><field name="subject">Employment Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Healing segmental diaphyseal defects using membrane guided bone regeneration</field><field name="creator">Patel, Minoo Keki, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Segmental gap defects in long bones are amongst the most difficult to heal. Membrane guided bone regeneration is a type of guided tissue regeneration wherein the gap defect is contained within a membrane ?? usually semi-permeable.  The aim of this thesis was to establish a reproducible cross-species model and to investigate the nature of membrane guided bone regeneration in detail. In a sheep tibia model, using reinforced ePTFE (expanded poly-tetra-fluoro-ethylene) tubes, critical 2.5 cm gap defects healed in 13/13 sheep compared with healing in only 2/11 in the control group (p&lt;0.05). Radiographic features in the ePTFE group included a horseshoe shaped endosteal regenerate, and postero-lateral periosteal regenerate. DEXA analysis demonstrated significantly larger area of bone formation in the membrane group (p&lt;0.05). Overall bone mineral density was also better in the membrane group (p&lt;0.05). Angiography showed 57 % vascularity posteriorly in the gap region compared to 43 % anteriorly (p=0.01) and 1.8 vessels /cm2 in the membrane group compared to 1.3 vessels/cm2 in the controls (p=0.01). Microscopy demonstrated new bone formation both within and outside the membrane. Periosteal bone was denser and mature while endosteal new bone was woven in nature, interspersed with cartilage islands. The collagen pattern observed in phase contrast microscopy indicated the endosteal new bone to be in continuity with the cambium layer of the cortex. These findings were reproduced in a rabbit forearm model, with union in 20/20 membrane specimens and non-union in 20/20 controls. In human subjects, using a meshed periosteal autograft, as a bioactive membrane, to contain cancellous autograft, union was obtained in 9/9 recalcitrant non-unions, including seven cases of congenital pseudoarthrosis of the tibia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44775</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein engineering of DNA polymerase I: thioredoxin dependent processivity</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Joyce, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">DNA polymerases are found in a diverse range of organisms, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, viruses and bacteriophage. T7 DNA polymerase is a replicative enzyme from E. coli bacteriophage T7. It relies on the thioredoxin binding domain (TBD) of phage gene 5 protein (gp5) and E. coli thioredoxin (Trx) for processive replication of phage DNA. Although T7 DNA polymerase is processive, it is also thermolabile. In order to design a thermostable and processive DNA polymerase, the structural stabilities of the TBD and Trx were studied in respect to their binding affinity and affect on enzyme processivity. An artificial operon was designed for coexpression of subunits of T7 DNA polymerase. By means of a 9??His-tag at the amino terminus of gp5, T7 DNA polymerase complex was purified by one-step nickel-agarose chromatography, with subunits gp5 and Trx co-eluting in a one to one molar ratio. Purified T7 DNA polymerase was assayed for polymerase activity, processivity and residual activity and compared to the commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The two enzymes were not identical with commercial T7 DNA polymerase being less processive at 37??C. Mass spectrometry of the two enzymes identified a mutation of Phe102 to Ser in the Trx subunit (TrxS102) of commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The Ser102 mutation, was found near the carboxyl terminal helix of Trx. TrxS102 was less stable than wild type Trx. In the study of the TBD structural stability, a hybrid polymerase was constructed by inserting the TBD motif into the homologous position in the Stoffel fragment of Taq DNA polymerase. The hybrid enzyme was coexpressed with Trx from an artificial operon; however, the TBD inserted retained a mesophilic binding affinity to Trx. The chimeric polymerase required 100 molar excess of Trx for processive polymerase activity at 60??C. TBD structural deformation at elevated temperatures was hypothesized to be the cause of the change in the subunit stoichiometry. Mutagenesis of TBD would be required to increase its thermostability. An efficient, rapid high throughput mutagenesis method (SLIM) was invented and would be appropriate for further studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA polymerases</field><field name="subject">protein engineering</field><field name="subject">thioredoxin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The modulating impact of skill level in the execution of knee extension in fast front kicking in taekwondo</field><field name="creator">Landeo, Raul , Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fast pushing like forms of knee extension were previously studied (van Ingen Schenau, 1994, Bobbert 1994). From these the role of mono and bi-articular muscles was established for this type of pushing like motion patterns. The way whipping like forms of knee extension are controlled is however less understood. This study investigated the impact of skill level in modulating fast forms of knee extension. The investigation was carried out by using a Taekwondo fast front kicking action, mean peak leg angular velocity 18.65 rads/s, as the subject task. A total of 40 healthy male and female participants volunteered to take part in this study. Of these, 20 were skilled martial arts athletes while the remaining 20 were unskilled. Expert and novice groups were randomly divided into treatment and control groups. A ten week intervention program aimed at increasing the skill level of participants of the expert and novice groups was conducted. The kinematic profile of the execution of a fast front kick performed under various settings of velocity, range of motion and degrees of freedom was obtained by a high speed camera. The myoelectrical activity of selected muscle units was simultaneously obtained while kicks were video recorded. Expert and novice participants were tested pre and post intervention program.  Of the available kinematic variables such as segmental angular velocities, joint linear velocities and intersegmental timing and coordination, it was found that only: peak ankle linear and leg angular velocities, intersegmental timing, thigh to leg peak angular velocity ratio and a calculated performance index, have the potential to discriminate differences in skill level in this form of kicking. Pre and post intervention differences between groups were assessed from these variables. It was of interest to this study to identify the sources of these differences. To this end, an inverse dynamics analysis of the interaction between segments during the execution of a front kick was performed. It was found that the interaction between segments evolves with increases in skill level. Expert athletes utilize a i) precursor knee flexion moment to assist hip flexion moment during the initial stages of the kicking action and ii) a late hip flexion moment to assist further increases of kicking speed. These moments were absent in the execution of a front kick by novice athletes. These findings were also obtained form an optimization approach to the analysis of interactive moments during kicking. An important conclusion from these analyses is that the view of a front kick as a proximal to distal motion pattern is inadequate. Evidence from this study suggests that this action is best defined as a distal-proximal-distal motion pattern in an expert population. It then indicates that skill gains rely on the utilization of intrinsic muscle properties to assist the execution of tasks like a front kick.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Segments Interaction</field><field name="subject">Kicking</field><field name="subject">Skill</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory and motor roles of tachykinins, vanilloids and acid in the urinary bladder mucosa</field><field name="creator">Sadananda, Prajni, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The bladder mucosa plays an essential role in bladder function. Several receptors are expressed on mucosal cells and the mucosal release of mediators is considered to contribute to bladder afferent signalling. However, mucosal motor activity has not been previously examined. The aim of this thesis was to examine the role of vanilloid TRPV1 and tachykinin NK2 receptors in the bladder mucosa. In addition, the expression and function of novel acid sensing ion channels (ASICs) was explored.  Pig and rat models were employed to examine potential species specific differences. In organ bath experiments, the tachykinin, neurokinin  A (NKA), was demonstrated to be a potent contractile agent of the pig mucosa. Mucosal responses to NKA were higher than those in intact strips and were mediated by the NK2 receptor, as evidenced by antagonist studies. Immunostaining revealed smooth muscle actin expression on suburothelial myofibroblasts, suggesting their potential role in mucosal contractile activity.  To examine the endogenous sources of NKA, contraction and ATP release in response to TRPV1 agonists. capsaicin and acid, were assessed in pig and rat mucosa. In pig mucosal strips, capsaicin did not evoke contraction or ATP release. However, acid (in the physiological range of normal urine) resulted in contraction and a 25-fold increase in ATP release compared with basal. In contrast, in rat mucosal strips, both capsaicin and acid were potent stimuli for ATP release. Acid-evoked ATP release was shown to be mediated via both the TRPV1 and ASIC receptors. ASIC receptor mRNA expression was demonstrated in the rat bladder mucosa and detrusor.  Results from this thesis demonstrate novel characteristics of the bladder mucosa: its ability to contract, distinct from the detrusor muscle. The contraction of the mucosa via NK2 receptors has provided a new (so far, overlooked) target for drugs in the treatment of bladder diseases. In addition, acid has been shown to be an important stimulus in modulating bladder function. With the focus of current bladder research shifting towards the sensory pathways, acid may represent an important endogenous initiator of bladder sensation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44979</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of bacteria associated with Australian wine grapes using cultural and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Bae, Sung Sook, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a systematic investigation of bacterial species associated with wine grapes cultivated in Australian vineyards during 2001-2004. Grapes, sampled throughout cultivation, were analysed for bacterial species using a combination of cultural and molecular methods. Red (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot) and white (Chardonnay, Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc) grape varieties were examined. Factors affecting the bacterial ecology of grapes were considered. The bacterial populations of mature undamaged grapes at harvest were consistently low at 102-103 CFU/g. Higher populations (103-106 CFU/g) were found on grapes at earlier stages of maturity and correlated with application of Bacillus thuringiensis as a biological pesticide. B. thuringiensis was the most prevalent bacterial species on wine grapes throughout cultivation, as determined by plate culture, enrichment culture and PCR-DGGE. B. thuringiensis carried over into wine processing but did not grow in juice or wine and did not adversely affect the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Oenococcus oeni in liquid culture. B. thuringiensis inhibited the growth of several spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi found on grapes. Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens was the second most prevalent species detected on wine grapes. Its populations rarely exceeded 103-104 CFU/g. Other bacteria (Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas) were sporadically found on grapes. Lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria were rarely detected on undamaged grapes by culture and PCR-DGGE methods. A greater incidence of lactic acid bacteria was detected by specific enrichment procedures, especially on damaged grape berries. Species found were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus mali, Lactobacillus lindneri and Lactobacillus kunkeei. The malolactic organism, O. oeni, was never isolated from any grape sample, raising questions about its enological origin. Enrichment cultures also revealed the presence of other bacteria (e.g. Sporolactobacillus inulinus, Asaia siamensis) not previously found on wine grapes. Atypical, hot and dry conditions during cultivation may account for the low populations of bacteria found on wine grapes. This factor combined with the overwhelming presence of B. thuringiensis prevented meaningful comparisons of data to determine influences of vineyard location, grape variety, grape maturity, climate and viticultural practices on the bacterial ecology of grapes. More systematic and controlled studies of these variables are required.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Meaning of UML Models</field><field name="creator">O'Keefe, Greg</field><field name="description">The Unified Modelling Language (UML) is intended to express complex ideas
in an intuitive and easily understood way. It is important because it is widely
used in software engineering and other disciplines. Although an official definition
document exists, there is much debate over the precise meaning of UML models.
&#182;
In response, the academic community have put forward many different proposals
for formalising UML, but it is not at all obvious how to decide between
them. Indeed, given that UML practitioners are inclined to reject formalisms as
non-intuitive, it is not even obvious that the definition should be &#147;formal&#148; at all.
Rather than searching for yet another formalisation of UML, our main aim is to
determine what would constitute a good definition of UML.
&#182;
The first chapter sets the UML definition problem in a broad context, relating
it to work in logic and the philosophy of science. More specific conclusions about
the nature of model driven development are reached in the beginning of Chapter 2.
We then develop criteria for a definition of UML. Applying these criteria to the
existing definition, we find that it is lacking in clarity. We then set out to test the
precision of the definition. The test is to take an apparently inconsistent model, and
determine whether it really is inconsistent according to the definition.
&#182;
Many people have proposed that UML models are graphs, but few have justified
this choice using the official definition of UML. We begin Chapter 3 by arguing
from the official definition that UML models are graphs and that instantiation
is a graph homomorphism into an interpretation functor. The official definition of
UML defines the semantics against its abstract syntax, which is in turn defined by
a UML model. Chapters 3 and 4 prepare for our test by resolving this apparent
circularity. The result is a semantics for the metamodel fragment of the language.
&#182;
In Chapter 5, we find, contrary to popular belief, that the official definition does
provide sufficient semantics to classify the example model as inconsistent. Moreover,
the sustained study of the semantics in Chapters 3 to 5 confirms our initial
argument that the semantic domain is graphs. The Actions are the building blocks
of UML&#146;s prescriptive dynamics. We see that they can be naturally defined as graph
transformation rules. Sequence diagrams are the main example of descriptive dynamics,
but we find that their official semantics are broken. The &#147;recorded history&#148;
approach should be replaced, we suggest, by a graph-oriented dynamic logic.
&#182;
Chapter 6 presents our early work on dynamic logic for UML sequence diagrams
and further explores the proposed semantic repairs. In Chapter 7, guided
by the criteria developed in Chapter 2, we critically survey the UML formalisation
literature and conclude that an existing body of graph transformation based work
known as &#147;dynamic metamodelling&#148; is very close to what is required.
&#182;
The final chapter draws together our conclusions. It proposes a category theoretic
construction to merge models of the syntax and semantic domain, yielding
a type graph for the graph transformation system which defines the dynamic semantics
of the language. Finally, it outlines the further work required to realise a

In this respect, a tax system needs to confront two fundamental (and interrelated) questions &#150; first, precisely how the tax or impost should be imposed and, secondly, who should bear the legal obligation or onus of payment. These issues can be conceptualised not only from a purely legal or positivist perspective, in terms of identifying who will incur the obligation to pay tax, but also in terms of a more economic and instrumental standpoint as to which entity or individual should effectively be paying the tax. These alternatives may not result in the same conclusions, particularly for the taxation of business forms. To provide one example, if the business form has separate legal entity status from its members, should the business form, as a legal person, be subject to tax separately from its members? From a legal standpoint the response to this question is that such a business form should bear the impost. However, from an economical perspective it may be preferable that the business income and/or losses are directly allocated to its members. Indeed, tax transparency (aggregate approach) has been argued as an economically superior model, although it is not without its critics...</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tax transparent companies</field><field name="subject">tax neutrality</field><field name="subject">tax system</field><field name="subject">Limited Liability Companies</field><field name="subject">LLC</field><field name="subject">Limited Liability Partnerships</field><field name="subject">LLP</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100615.094301</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Libyan Attitudes towards Islamic Methods of Finance: An Empirical Analysis of Retail Consumers, Business Firms and Banks</field><field name="creator">Gait, Alsadek Hesain Abdelsalam</field><field name="description">Libya is a predominately Muslim country where Islamic finance has not yet been established. However, given the current extensive program of financial reform in Libya and the rapid growth and appeal of Islamic finance in comparable economies, there is growing pressure for a system of Islamic finance to be provided. There is then a pressing need for research into the prospects for Islamic finance from a consumer and provider perceptive to inform this debate and thereby meet the needs of policymakers, financial service providers and prospective users. Accordingly, this study of Libyan attitudes towards Islamic methods of finance, the first study attempted in the Libyan context and one of few studies globally, applies a model derived from the Theory of Reasoned Action to analyse attitudes towards Islamic finance. The particular focus is to understand how the Theory of Reasoned Action can be used for predicting and understanding attitudes towards the potential use of Islamic methods of finance by Libyan retail consumers, business firms and banks. Four main research questions are posed to address this objective. First, does awareness of Islamic methods of finance influence attitudes towards the use of Islamic finance? Second, do socioeconomic, demographic and other factors influence attitudes towards Islamic finance? Third, what are the principal motivating factors towards the potential use of Islamic finance? Finally, is religion the major influence on the likelihood of engaging in Islamic finance? Three surveys of 385 retail consumers, 296 business firms and 134 bank managers in Libya are conducted in 2007/08 to achieve this objective. Descriptive analysis and multivariate statistical analysis (including factor analysis, discriminant analysis and binary logistic regressions) are used to analyse the data. The principal findings are that awareness of Islamic methods of finance and socioeconomic, demographic and business characteristics are key determinants of the likelihood of the use of Islamic finance. Further, religion plays a key, though not the only, role in influencing these attitudes. The thesis findings are of key importance in informing future financial industry practice and financial policy formation in Libya.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Islamic finance</field><field name="subject">finance</field><field name="subject">Libya</field><field name="subject">Islam</field><field name="subject">financial reform</field><field name="subject">financial policy</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100615.104528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

In order to inform consumers about their products or services, marketers apply a variety of advertising strategies. One particular strategy is &#8220;contextual advertising&#8221;, which refers to the strategic placement of advertisements in an editorial environment whose theme is relevant for the promoted product or service (Belch &amp; Belch, 2009, p. 492). Also in advertising research, contextual advertising received a considerable amount of attention. Scholars have investigated the effectiveness of contextual advertising in online and offline media. Researchers as well as practitioners have particularly focused on content-based relationships between advertisements and the theme of the editorial environment in which the advertisement is placed. With a focus on online media, the present study aimed to investigate this content-based relationship but also to examine what other types of relationships between the different contents on a webpage the user constructs. Advertising has also been investigated in the area of semiotics. Several scholars analysed advertisements in order to reveal their meaning-affordances. A second interest in the present study derives from semiotic studies and theories, which emphasise the individual&#8217;s significance in the meaning-making process but also exclude the individual from their analysis. A potential contradiction could be seen here and by investigating how users interpret a particular webpage, this study aimed to examine what insights an analysis can provide that is solely focused on the webpage user. In order to capture users&#8217; interpretations of a webpage&#8217;s contents and to investigate what types of relationships between these contents users construct semi-structured interviews with six participants were conducted. The participants were invited to look at a webpage from the website www.healthyfood.co.nz. Following the interviews, the participants&#8217; responses were transcribed, categorised and analysed. Findings from the study revealed that several participants constructed relationships between advertisements and the editorial content based on content-similarity but also on design-similarity as well as their personal knowledge about sponsorship relationships and income-investment relationships. Personal knowledge also appeared to be important for the interpretation of the webpage. The participants&#8217; interpretation of the webpage were also guided by their personal interest in the contents, their individual contexts like socio-cultural background, experiences and beliefs as well as environmental factors such as time and the layout of the interview location. The results of the study support the significant role of the individual in the process of meaning making and further contribute to an extended understanding of contextual advertising. Practical suggestions for the advertising area and future research were also identified.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Online communication</field><field name="subject">Online advertising</field><field name="subject">Contextual advertising</field><field name="subject">Perception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical modelling of mixing between rectangular jets present in tangentially fired brown coal boilers.</field><field name="creator">Scarsella, Alessio Angelo</field><field name="description">Large scale power generation commences with the combustion of coal or other fuel, which in turn converts high pressure water into steam which then drives a turbine thus generating electricity. Burning high moisture coal, such as lignite, for power generation implies that a significant amount of energy is wasted in vaporising the moisture, which could otherwise be used in the steam raising process. This implies that more moist coal would be required to drive the same process than if the coal was drier, thus increasing the amount of combustion products such as greenhouses gases. Introducing a dried coal in an existing boiler will significantly change the heat flux profiles, which could result in boiler damage or excessive fouling. Flame temperature is influenced by the supply of reactants; in most cases the limiting reactant will be oxygen. The supply of oxygen (through air) to a pneumatically transported coal stream and subsequent reaction is controlled by the localised fluid mechanics or &#8216;mixing&#8217;. This research aims to provide an understanding of the mixing process between the pneumatically transported coal and air in brown coal fired boilers by modelling the individual jets. The effects of the change in velocity ratio for the air (secondary) jets and fuel (primary) jets of rectangular burners typical of those found in brown coal fired boilers has been studied experimentally and is reported in this thesis. In particular, scientific analysis was used to investigate the physical mechanisms which control fuel-air mixing, and to quantify the concentration of primary and secondary fluid. The concentration data was used in a regression model in conjunction with a reactive combustion model, developed from a 1:30 scale cold model of the Yallourn W&#8217; stage 2 boiler, in order that overall boiler performance can be assessed. This overall study is fundamental as a result of the questions raised concerning the future of brown coal in modern society. A qualitative flow visualisation study of the unconfined 1:30 scaled primary, and two adjacent rectangular jets, was conducted using single colour planar laser induced fluorescence. The characteristics of the jet flow were examined by imaging individually seeded primary and secondary jets and were visualised through four different planes longitudinally, on the axes of each jet. In addition, a transverse qualitative and quantitative study on the rectangular jets was also conducted for the individually seeded jets, and was visualised through planes of flow perpendicular to the direction flow, specifically at axial stations of x/D =0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The flow characteristics were also examined under different co-flow conditions, particularly secondary to primary jet velocity ratios (&#955;) of 0, 0.55, 1.4, 2.8, 3.6 and &#8734;. This quantitative data yields the basis for a 3D regression model to predict fuel-air mixing in actual boilers. A semi-quantitative investigation into some geometrical modifications on the rectangular jets was also conducted at velocity ratios of &#955;=0, 0.55 and 1.4. The rectangular nozzles were fitted with base plates orientated at 90 degrees and 60 degrees to the direction of flow. The longitudinal flow visualisation study highlighted the effect of velocity ratio on the flow field of the primary and secondary jets. In particular it showed that the main structures of the primary and secondary jets are sensitive to the co-flowing conditions. The primary jet also experienced the formation of coherent structures close to the bluff body re-circulation region for &#955;&gt;2.8. The quantitative transverse analysis of the rectangular jets showed that the primary jet and secondary jets close to the nozzle exit plane distorted with a change in co-flowing conditions. The primary jet experienced distortion for &#955;&gt;1.4, and the secondary jets experienced distortion for &#955; &lt;1.4. A plausible mechanism for this &#8220;distortion&#8221; can be explained by different co-flowing conditions altering the velocity gradients of the jet, thus changing the denomination of the counter rotating vortices present in the corners of rectangular jets, allowing them to alter jet shape. The transverse quantitative analysis of the rectangular jets allowed for graphical representation of the normalised concentration of the primary and secondary jets in the radial direction and the centreline mixture fraction decay. The analysis of the latter showed that the primary jet, under all co-flow conditions, reached self-similarity at approximately x/D =4, whereas the secondary jets did so at x/D =2. The primary jets observed greater rates of centreline dilution at high velocity ratios, whereas the secondary jets did so at &#955;=0.55. The quantification of the centreline concentration decay obeyed the inverse rate law for all co-flowing conditions. The first order decay constant K&#8321;, was found to be heavily dependant on velocity ratio. The planar transverse quantitative data of the primary and secondary jets was used with the method of weighted squares to develop a regression model that would three-dimensionally reproduce the scalar mixing field as a function of velocity ratio. The regression model reproduces scalar quantities for &#955;=0 and &#955;=0.55 to 3.6 for the primary jet and &#955;=0.55 to 3.6 and &#8734; for the secondary jet, and is capable of predicting primary and secondary bulk fluid concentrations within 30 to 40 % of the measured values. A sensitivity analysis on the regression model revealed that it is highly responsive to the momentum-controlling region between the jets with a change in velocity ratio.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rectangular jets; scalar; concentration; tangentially fired boilers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adsorption and biological filtration of microcystins.</field><field name="creator">Wang, Haixiang</field><field name="description">For removal of microcystins (liver tumor promoting cyanotoxins) from drinking water granular activated carbon (GAC) filtration has been shown to be a very promising treatment option. It is not only an efficient adsorbent for microcystins but also can be operated as a biological reactor in which bacterial degradation of the toxins can occur extending the life-time of this application. However, the competitive adsorption of coexistent natural organic matter (NOM) in all natural water sources would cause early breakthrough of microcystins and a lag-phase with uncertain length occurs prior to initiation of biodegradation. This project aimed to investigate the individual microcystin removal abilities by adsorption and biodegradation during GAC filtration in order to better understand the overall efficiency of this application. The  simultaneous elimination of NOM in GAC filters was also investigated. In addition, to facilitate the biological removal of microcystins, the research aimed to identify the potential effect of key operational conditions on the degradation efficiency. In this study microcystin removal in GAC filtration was divided into the adsorption and biodegradation phases. Effective adsorption of the toxins lasted only a short term in virgin GAC filters and the breakthrough behaviour was able to be modelled by the homogenous surface diffusion model (HSDM). The presence of biofilm on the surfaces of GAC resulted in a lower mass transfer coefficient (Kf) and lower adsorption kinetics of microcystins. In the biodegradation phase enhanced or complete removal was evident that was mainly due to biological metabolism. However, the highly efficient biodegradation of the toxins was difficult to predict in GAC filtration. Biodegradation was found to be easily affected by many operational factors. NOM removal in GAC filters demonstrated specific features in this study due to the relatively high organic content in the Australian water. The adsorption efficiency decreased rapidly as the adsorption capacity became saturated.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision-feedback equalisation with fixed-lag smoothing in nonlinear channels.</field><field name="creator">Bartel, David Wayne</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with an aspect of the field of digital signal processing, namely, the  application of fixed-lag smoothing (FLS) to decision-feedback equalisation (DFE). The resultant algorithm was introduced in a recent paper and is termed herein the Fixed-Lag-Smoothing  Decision-Feedback Equalisation (FLSDFE) algorithm. The motivation for studying the FLSDFE algorithm is that it may potentially improve the performance of a standard DFE algorithm, providing more reliable digital communication and data storage. This thesis extends previous results by applying the FLSDFE algorithm to linear and nonlinear channels, of minimum- or nonminimum-phase. In chapter 2 the FLSDFE formulae are derived for two classes of nonlinear digital communication channel, both described by truncated Volterra series. Section 2.3 treats the case of MPSK and MQAM signalling, and section 2.4 treats the case of BPSK  signalling. The discrete probability distribution function of the FLSDFE output estimator is given in each case. Chapter 3 introduces state space models that capture the exact transient dynamics of the FLSDFE algorithm. The atomic model was introduced by other authors earlier, but a suboptimal aggregation of the atomic model is given that is closely linked to an existing steady-state model. Connections are shown between the state space models and the theory of integer partitions, as well as between linear recurrence relations that generalise that of the Fibonacci series. Examples of the performance of the FLSDFE algorithm are provided in chapter 4. Two underwater-acoustic communication channels are simulated, and it is shown that the FLSDFE performs well there, giving lower bit error rates than the DFE alone. Generic channel models, both linear and cubic, minimum- and nonminimum-phase, were then simulated. These showed some peculiar characteristics of the FLSDFE algorithm's behaviour. In particular, using the steady-state models of chapter 3, we observe a pseudo-resonance with increasing SNR (that is, the existence of an optimum SNR) - this is related to the presence of previous equalisation errors. As a caveat to the blind use of the FLSDFE over the DFE, we illustrate that it may be necessary to determine the optimum smoothing lag to use before applying the FLSDFE algorithm, especially on difficult nonlinear channels. On such channels, increasing the lag beyond this optimum may produce worse equalisation performance than at the optimum lag. Despite this word of caution, however, the FLSDFE seems to provide a robust improvement over the DFE across a broad range of channels.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the pathogenic agent in a Drosophila model of polyglutamine disease</field><field name="creator">McLeod, Catherine</field><field name="description">A substantial body of evidence supports the identity of polyglutamine as the pathogenic agent in a variety of human neurodegenerative diseases (some of which are clinically indistinguishable from the polyglutamine diseases) that are due to expanded repeats that cannot encode  polyglutamine. As polyglutamine cannot be the pathogenic agent in these diseases, either the different disorders have distinct pathogenic pathways or some other common agent is toxic in all of the expanded repeat diseases. Recently, evidence has been presented in support of RNA as the pathogenic agent in Fragile X- associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), caused by expanded CGG repeats at the FRAXA locus. A Drosophila model of FXTAS, in which 90 copies of the CGG repeat are expressed in an untranslated region of RNA, exhibits both neurodegeneration and similar molecular pathology to the polyglutamine diseases. Therefore the identity of the pathogenic agent in a Drosophila model of the polyglutamine diseases was explored. This included examining the possibility that RNA mediates the disease phenotype by expression of repeat constructs including expanded CAA and CAG repeats and an untranslated CAG repeat. Alternative putative pathogenic mechanisms including polyalanine toxicity, DNA damage and axonal blockage were also examined. The results obtained support the identity of polyglutamine as the pathogenic agent in this Drosophila model of  polyglutamine disease. However, additional preliminary results were obtained suggesting that repeat-containing RNA expressed at a sufficiently high level can exert a toxic effect. The phenotype induced by repeat-containing RNA in Drosophila is milder than the polyglutamine phenotype, characterised by degeneration and shows cell type-specificity. Thus, although in this Drosophila model, polyglutamine toxicity appears to occur in the absence of a contribution by RNA, the possibility that it contributes towards pathogenesis in the human diseases cannot be ruled out.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on renal safety and preventive analgesic efficacy of tramadol and parecoxib in dogs : thesis in fulfilment of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary Clinical Science, Institute of Veterinary Animal and Biomedical Sciences, College of Sciences, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kongara, Kavitha</field><field name="description">Ovariohysterectomy and castration are common surgical procedures in small animal practice that can result in clinically significant postoperative pain. One way of controlling postoperative pain is administration of a single analgesic or a combination of different classes of analgesics prior to the onset of noxious stimuli. A constraint to the perioperative use of traditional opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is their undesirable side effects. In this series of experiments, the preventive (pre-emptive) analgesic efficacy of two popular human analgesics, tramadol (an ?atypical? opioid) and parecoxib (a NSAID with selective COX-2 inhibition) was evaluated in dogs. Initially, the efficacy and renal safety of parecoxib, tramadol and a combination of parecoxib, tramadol and pindolol (a -adrenoceptor blocker and 5-HT1A/1B antagonist) were screened in anaesthetised healthy dogs. These analgesics increased the dogs? nociceptive threshold to mechanical stimuli, without causing significant alterations in the dogs? glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by plasma iohexol clearance. Subsequently, the efficacy of tramadol was compared with morphine, in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy or castration. The Glasgow composite measure pain scale-short form score (CMPS-SF) and changes in intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) responses were used to assess the efficacy of analgesics. Of the three treatment groups (preoperative morphine, 0.5 mg kg-1; preoperative tramadol, 3 mg kg-1; a ?combination? of preoperative low-dose morphine, 0.1 mg kg-1, and postoperative tramadol 3 mg kg-1), dogs given the ?combination? had significantly lower pain scores after ovariohysterectomy. In castrated dogs, preoperative tramadol (3 mg kg-1) and morphine (0.5 mg kg-1) were tested and no significant difference in the CMPS-SF score were observed between them. Changes in EEG variables were not specific between the treatment groups in ovariohysterectomised dogs. Finally, the efficacy of test drugs was evaluated against acute noxious electrical stimulation in anaesthetised dogs, using EEG. Median frequency of the EEG, a reliable indicator of nociception, increased significantly in tramadol and parecoxib groups, compared to morphine, after electrical stimulation. These studies demonstrated that tramadol and parecoxib can produce analgesia in dogs with insignificant side effects. The efficacy of tramadol appears to vary with the type of noxious stimulus. A complete prevention of noxious input by administration of analgesics pre- and post-operatively could have important clinical applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analgesics</field><field name="subject">anaesthesia</field><field name="subject">pain relief</field><field name="subject">dog surgery</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300502 Anaesthesiology and intensive care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Least-squares optimal interpolation for direct image super-resolution : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gilman, Andrew</field><field name="description">Image super-resolution aims to produce a higher resolution representation of a scene from an ensemble of low-resolution images that may be warped, aliased, blurred and degraded by noise. There are a variety of methods for performing super-resolution described in the literature, and in general they consist of three major steps: image registration, fusion and deblurring. This thesis proposes a novel method of performing the first two of these steps. The ultimate aim of image super-resolution is to produce a higher-quality image that is visually clearer, sharper and contains more detail than the individual input images. Machine algorithms can not assess images qualitatively and typically use a quantitative error criterion, often least-squares. This thesis aims to optimise leastsquares directly using a fast method, in particular one that can be implemented using linear filters; hence, a closed-form solution is required. The concepts of optimal interpolation and resampling are derived and demonstrated in practice. Optimal filters optimised on one image are shown to perform nearoptimally on other images, suggesting that common image features, such as stepedges, can be used to optimise a near-optimal filter without requiring the knowledge of the ground-truth output. This leads to the construction of a pulse model, which is used to derive filters for resampling non-uniformly sampled images that result from the fusion of registered input images. An experimental comparison shows that a 10th order pulse model-based filter outperforms a number of methods common in the literature. The use of optimal interpolation for image registration linearises an otherwise nonlinear problem, resulting in a direct solution. Experimental analysis is used to show that optimal interpolation-based registration outperforms a number of existing methods, both iterative and direct, at a range of noise levels and for both heavily aliased images and images with a limited degree of aliasing. The proposed method offers flexibility in terms of the size of the region of support, offering a good trade-off in terms of computational complexity and accuracy of registration. Together, optimal interpolation-based registration and fusion are shown to perform fast, direct and effective super-resolution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image resolution</field><field name="subject">optimal filters</field><field name="subject">optimal interpolation</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software::291601 Arithmetic and logic structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The importance of communication infrastructure in concurrent engineering : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Engineering in Computer Systems Engineering at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">McGillan, Rusul</field><field name="description">Concurrent engineering is an imperative concept in the world of product development. With the globalisation of industry, the market has been demanding higher quality products at lower costs, delivered at faster pace. With most companies today accepting the concurrent engineering approach as a formula for product development success, this approach is becoming ever more popular and dominating over the slower sequential product development method. Fast changes in technology, forced design cycle time reduction, emergence of new information technology and methodologies, as well as other aspects such as organisational and behavioural basis caused the sequential design process to progress into a concurrent engineering approach. The basic concept behind the concurrent engineering approach is that all parts of the design, manufacture, production, management, finance, and marketing of the product are usually involved in the early stages of a product&#8217;s design cycle, enabling faster product development through extensive use of simulation. Its key approach is to get the right data for the right person at the right time. There are forces that govern changes in the product development, and these forces must be steered towards prompt response to competition and higher productivity in order for companies to exist and successfully expand in the global market place. Concurrent engineering is made up of four key dimensions, one of them the communication infrastructure dimension, which is the focus of this study. This study defines the information infrastructure dimension, and some of the tools and technologies that support communication and collaboration. It then discusses how to employ the concurrent engineering approach from a communication infrastructure dimension point of view, starting with assessing the current product development process and eventually envisioning the path to take to a successful concurrent engineering environment. Communication infrastructure technologies and tools can be seen as central to a company&#8217;s implementation of concurrent engineering, as shown in the case studies covered in this work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">communication infrastructure</field><field name="subject">concurrent engineering</field><field name="subject">computer systems engineering</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of models for the genetic improvement of dairy cattle under cooperative dairying conditions in Bangladesh : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in animal Breeding and Genetics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Khan, Md Kabirul Islam</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to enquire into genetic approaches for improving milk yield from dairy cattle in order to overcome the milk shortage in Bangladesh. Survey work on the dairy industry was carried out to reveal its current status. The collected data of different genotypes (Pabna cattle, Australian-Friesian-Sahiwal Pabna, Holstein Pabna, Jersey Pabna, and Sahiwal Pabna) from 1999 to 2001, and in two seasons, were used to predict model parameters, fit-statistics and total lactation yields, by fitting ten lactation curve models. Best fitting model(s) were chosen on the basis of fit-statistics. The input parameters from best fiting model(s) were used for: developing a deterministic model; estimating the profitability of individual cows; estimating whole farm profitability; and for developing a profit function to estimate the economic values of traits in breeding objectives. The individual cow performances for different traits were stochastically simulated in respect of additive genetic, permanent and temporary error, herd and age effects, and mendelian sampling under progeny and parent-average testing breeding schemes based on three selection objectives applied over on 20 year period. Genetic gains in different traits were calculated from the regression of trait values on the selection index. The estimated lactation curves model parameters, and predicted lactation milk yield were significantly different between breeds, years and seasons. From four fit-statistics values, the CCC value was considered superior, and this value indicated that the Nelder model best represented the test day records. The net annual income for Holstein Pabna cattle was the highest (US$229) and was lowest (US$115) for Pabna cattle, while all other genotypes were intermediate. The economic values (EVs) of milk yield for all genotypes were similar (US$0.32), and due to payment for milk volume only, the EVs of fat and protein were negative. EVs of liveweight, calving intervals and calving rate were negative, but survivability was positive in all genotypes. The parent-average testing selection scheme showed higher genetic gains than progeny testing. The highest (US$15.80) genetic gain was obtained for milk yield when selection was for milk merit only. The study will assist in undertaking a genetic improvement programme for the increase of milk production in Bangladesh and thereby enhance food security.

Despite its popularity as an educational environment tool, the successful implementation of a virtual classroom is heavily reliant on the educator. This research focuses on the perceptions of educators regarding the acceptance of the MUVE as an educational tool. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to identify and evaluate the potential benefits of the MUVE in the domain of education. The qualitative approach was considered to be the suitable approach for this study. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 educators; these interviews included the demonstration of a virtual class located in the Second Life Island known as Jokaydia. The collected data was transcribed using NVivo software, and analysed using constant comparison analysis. The transcribed interviews were provided to another researcher in order to obtain an independent analysis; this created the basis for triangulation of participants&#8217; perceptions. A summary of this analysis was then sent to all participants to confirm its credibility. The conclusions of the study suggest that the combination of MUVEs&#8217; features and strengths will eventually influence the educators to accept the MUVE as an educational tool, although several areas of concern are identified. Future growth in the educational uses of MUVEs is examined, the implications and limitations of the study are discussed, and ideas for future research are elaborated on.

The first one is the connection between classroom instruction and student learning outcomes, and the second one is the relationship between theoretical choice and analytical results. In this study, two theoretical perspectives were employed in parallel to examine a sequence of nine lessons on the topic of &#8220;Matter&#8221; in a Year 7 science classroom. These two theoretical perspectives are: Distributed Cognition (Hutchins, 1995) and Variation Theory (Marton and Tsui, 2004). The results of each analysis were compared and contrasted in an attempt to identify their similarities and differences in describing and explaining the classroom practice documented.The analyses from both theoretical lenses pointed to several issues underlying student difficulties identified in this classroom, including the problematic macroscopic-microscopic relationship, the lack of attention to &#8220;substance&#8221;, and the taken-for-granted temperature conditions. However, the two theoretical perspectives differed in their capacity to accommodate learning at different levels, to address the connection between instruction and learning, and to identify and advocate the likely benefits of particular instructional approaches. Distributed Cognition unfolded the connection between teaching and learning by a careful examination of social interactions and the utilization of artefacts in these interactions. It speculated learning occurring in different types of social configurations and interactions found in a science classroom (e.g. collaborative activities). From the perspective of Distributed Cognition, the inappropriate employment or coordination of resources was the key factor contributing to the limited success in establishing shared understanding among the participants in the classroom. Variation Theory explicitly modelled the connection between instruction and learning through the idea of patterns of variation, and it provided some general principles to evaluate the teaching of a specific topic. From the perspective of Variation Theory, it was the lack of appropriate variation in the key attributes of the object of learning that contributed to the limited success in developing student capability to make differentiations between critical and uncritical aspects of a scientific concept. But current applications of Variation Theory do not include learning occurring in the private domain of the classroom (e.g. student-student interaction) and are silent on the role of collaborative activity (e.g. group work) in learning.The juxtaposition of the parallel analyses showed that the two theories are complementary and mutually informing in their explanations of the documented classroom practice. But their assumptions about what constitutes learning and what contributes to that learning differed from each other. This study suggested that we should focus our attention on the identification of the contingencies of compatibilities in our efforts to combine or synthesize elements of different theories. In this study, the local combination of the results generated from the parallel analyses contributed to a more complete understanding of science learning as it occurred in the classroom.The findings of this study should inform science teaching, curriculum development, and instructional design of science classrooms. It also generated implications for research into science classrooms and suggested the need for the science education community to examine the role of theory and the relationship between theoretical choice and analytical results obtained through the employment of a particular theory.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">science education, classroom research, student learning, distributed cognition, variation theory</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of BCG vaccine strain on the immune response and protection against tuberculosis</field><field name="creator">Ritz, Nicole</field><field name="description">More than 100 million doses of Bacille-Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG) vaccine are given each year to protect infants against tuberculosis (TB).

Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professionalisation of Australian catholic social welfare, 1920-1985</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Damian John, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the neglected history of Australian Catholic social welfare, focusing on the period, 1920-85. Central to this study is a comparative analysis of diocesan welfare bureaux (Centacare), especially the Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide agencies. Starting with the origins of professional welfare at local levels, this thesis shows the growth in Catholic welfare services across Australia. The significant transition from voluntary to professional Catholic welfare in Australia is a key theme. Lay trained women inspired the transformation in the church???s welfare services. Prepared predominantly by their American training, these women devoted their lives to fostering social work in the Church and within the broader community. The women demonstrated vision and tenacity in introducing new policies and practices across the disparate and unco-ordinated Australian Catholic welfare sector. Their determination challenged the status quo, especially the church???s preference for institutionalisation of children, though they packaged their reforms with compassion and pragmatism. Trained social workers offered specialised guidance though such efforts were often not appreciated before the 1960s. New approaches to welfare and the co-ordination of services attracted varying degrees of resistance and opposition from traditional Catholic charity providers: religious orders and the voluntary-based St Vincent de Paul Society (SVdP). For much of the period under review diocesan bureaux experienced close scrutiny from their ordinaries (bishops), regular financial difficulties, and competition from other church-based charities for status and funding. Following the lead of lay women, clerics such as Bishop Algy Thomas, Monsignor Frank McCosker and Fr Peter Phibbs (Sydney); Bishop Eric Perkins (Melbourne), Frs Terry Holland and Luke Roberts (Adelaide), consolidated Catholic social welfare. For four decades an unprecedented Sydney-Melbourne partnership between McCosker and Perkins had a major impact on Catholic social policy, through peak bodies such as the National Catholic Welfare Committee and its successor the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission. The intersection between church and state is examined in terms of welfare policies and state aid for service delivery. Peak bodies secured state aid for the church???s welfare agencies, which, given insufficient church funding proved crucial by the mid 1980s.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Church charities -- Australia -- Catholic Church -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Social workers -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Volunteer workers in social service -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Professions -- Social aspects -- Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26952</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consequences of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems</field><field name="creator">O???Connell, Amanda Elizabeth, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the effects of an altered intrauterine environment on the offspring???s renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems. After a midgestational asphyxial episode in fetal sheep (30 min total umbilical cord occlusion at 90 days; term 150 days) the hydrops that resulted had not completely resolved by 130 days. While the heart and kidneys were apparently unaffected, the brain and lung weights were 37% and 50% lower than sham values, respectively and there were joint contractures. The effects of maternal renal disease on the offspring were investigated. Although in utero fetuses of subtotally nephrectomised ewes (STNx) had altered urine flow rates, sodium excretion, haematocrits, plasma chloride and plasma renin levels, by 1-2 weeks after birth these values in the lambs (STNxL) were similar to controls (ConL) under baseline conditions. Body weight and the weights of most organs were similar, including the kidney, in which glomerular number was normal. In the neonatal period, the lambs were subjected to four challenges: furosemide (2 mg/kg intravenous bolus), infusion of angiotensin II and phenylephrine, intravenous infusion of 0.15M saline (50 ml/kg over 30 min) and haemorrhage (20% estimated blood volume over 10 min). These challenges revealed evidence of programming of several aspects of the renal, cardiovascular and renin angiotensin systems in the STNx offspring. As young adults at 6 months of age, male and female offspring of STNx ewes were normotensive and had normal renal function. On a high salt diet (HSD, 0.17M NaCl in 8L water for 5-7days), female offspring of both groups did not become hypertensive. However, the STNx offspring must have retained salt and water as plasma sodium was increased and haematocrit was decreased. In the STNx offspring only, there was a relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mean arterial pressure, indicating an inability to maintain a constant GFR in response to changes in arterial pressure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neonatology</field><field name="subject">Fetus - Physiology</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system</field><field name="subject">Renin-angiotensin system</field><field name="subject">Kidneys</field><field name="subject">Sheep- Embryos</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the nature of postcancer fatigue in women treated for early-stage breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Barbara Kaye, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem investigated Four studies investigated the phenomenon of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in women who had received adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer, with a view to reducing the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding the syndrome and thus facilitating progress in both clinical management and aetiological research. Procedures and results A cross-sectional study of 109 women compared a ???cancer-specific??? self-report questionnaire (FACT-F) (canvassing fatigue symptoms) and a more generic questionnaire (SPHERE) (identifying depression and fatigue). Thirty-seven percent of women reported fatigue. Overall in 20%, fatigue was associated with psychological distress. Seventeen percent of women had fatigue but no depression. A qualitative study utilised focus groups to identify and compare the distinctive features of CRF with those of women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A similar set of symptoms was found in both groups, including overwhelming fatigue, un-refreshing sleep and subjective concentration problems. However, women with CFS also reported myalgia and arthralgia. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Neurasthenia- SCIN, the third study compared the symptoms of three groups of women with fatigue: those with CRF, CFS or major depression. The detailed ???interviewer guide??? provided explicit directions for evaluating and classifying symptoms. This study confirmed the core symptom of ???profound fatigue unrelieved by rest???, and additional features that distinguished between the clinical diagnoses. The fourth study compared features of the evolution of clinically-identified fatigue syndromes in women from two prospective cohort studies; women with post-cancer fatigue (PCF) and women with post-infective fatigue syndrome (PIFS). Major conclusions A syndrome of PCF, present at least six months following adjuvant treatment and unexplained by medical or psychiatric disorder was investigated. The characteristics of PCF and those of CFS are very similar, with the fatigue state having indistinguishable descriptors. Longitudinal evaluation of the symptom complexes of PCF and PIFS suggests divergent pathways may be relevant. Co-morbid features like sleep disturbance; physical deconditioning and mood disturbance may be implicated as factors in the evolution and prolongation of PCF. These studies provide a basis for a more uniform and rigorous classification system - a necessary first step towards advancing the field both in investigating aetiology and new intervention strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- cancer; Cancer -- adjuvant treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The single source chemical vapour deposition of alkaline earth metal oxide thin films</field><field name="creator">Hill, Matthew Roland, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal oxide thin films are dynamic materials that have revolutionised the nature of semiconductor and electronic thin film devices. Recently, progress has stagnated in some aspects due to the increasingly complex deposition apparatus required, and the dearth of suitable precursor complexes of certain ???difficult??? metals. This thesis seeks to address both of these issues. The application of a precursor complex, Mg6(O2CNEt2)12 to the SSCVD of MgO thin films delivered the highest quality films ever reported with this technique. The resultant films were found to be of purely (111) orientation. Due to the nature of the precursor, the chemical reactions occurring at the surface during SSCVD growth result in a high growth rate, low flux environment and films of (111) orientation have been achieved without the amorphous underlayer. This finding has important implications for buffer layers in perovskite thin film devices. The unprecedented precursor chemistry has been used as a basis for the extremely high quality material produced, along with the unusual, yet beneficial structural morphology it possesses. A new range of barium complexes with single encapsulating ligands have been prepared for use in chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of BaTiO3 thin films. A novel pathway to an unprecedented class of barium carbamates is reported, and also new dianionic bis ??-ketoesterates and their barium, strontium, and calcium analogues were synthesised. High resolution mass spectrometry showed the barium bis ??-ketoesterate derivatives to be monomeric, and preliminary testing indicated some volatility in these species. Insights were gained into the likely successful pathways to building a volatile heterobimetallic precursor complex containing an alkaline earth metal. The knowledge of intimate mixing in heterobimetallic precursor complexes was extended by some novel chemistry to develop the first mixed Zn/Mg carbamato cluster complexes. These complexes were found to be excellent SSCVD precursors for ZnxMg1-xO thin films. Thin films were deposited with these precursors and exhibited a single preferred orientation, with a constant amount of magnesium throughout the bulk of the films. Investigation of the light emission properties of the films revealed significant improvements in the structural order commensurate with the incorporation of magnesium, and the formation of the ZnxMg1-xO alloy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metal oxide semiconductors -- Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Chemical vapor deposition</field><field name="subject">Alkaline earth metals</field><field name="subject">Thin films -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/32903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new evolutionary optimisation method for the operation of power systems with multiple storage resources</field><field name="creator">Thai, Cau Doan Hoang, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Advanced technologies, a world-wide trend to deregulation of power systems and environmental constraints have attracted increasing interest in the operation of electric power systems with multiple storage resources. Under the competitive pressure of the deregulation, new efficient solution techniques to adapt quickly to the changing marketplace are in demand. This thesis presents a new evolutionary method, Constructive Evolutionary Programming (CEP), for minimising the system operational cost of scheduling electric power systems with multiple storage resources. The method combines the advantages of Constructive Dynamic Programming and Evolutionary Programming. Instead of evolving the "primal" variables such as storage content releases and thermal generator outputs, CEP evolves the piecewise linear convex cost-to-go functions (i.e. the storage content value curves). The multi-stage problem of multi-storage power system scheduling is thus decomposed into many smaller one-stage subproblems with evolved cost-to-go functions. For each evolutionary individual, linear programming is used in the forward pass process to solve the dispatch subproblems and the total system operational cost over the scheduling period is assigned to its fitness. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and efficient for multi-storage power systems, particularly large complex hydrothermal system with cascaded and pumped storages. Although the proposed method is in the early stage of development, relying on assumptions of piecewise linear convexity in a deterministic environment, methods for the incorporation of stochastic models, electrical network and nonlinear, non-convex and non-smooth models are discussed. In addition, a number of possible improvements are also outlined. Due to its simplicity but robustness and efficiency, there are potential research directions for the further development of this evolutionary optimisation method.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary programming Computer science</field><field name="subject">Dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment manager trading behaviour and performance</field><field name="creator">Looi, Adrian, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents an examination of the trading behaviour of active Australian fund managers. The thesis begins with an analysis of how fund manager trades relate to stock returns in the past, the present, and the future. The dissertation next proceeds to investigating how fund size affects fund performance, trading and portfolio construction. Finally, using earnings announcements as the locus for trading sequences, we analyse the nature of the information used by fund managers to predict stock returns.  This research is presented in the form of three essays. The first essay investigates how active fund manager trades relate to stock returns. Using a unique database of daily transactions from Australian equity managers, we document that our sample of institutional investors exhibit statistically and economically significant predictive power in forecasting future stock returns over the ten days following their trades. Furthermore, detailed analysis indicates that manager style is important in understanding the link between institutional trading and stock returns. The essay finds growth-oriented managers are momentum traders, while style-neutral and value managers are contrarian. Further, the contemporaneous relation between institutional trading and returns depends on trade size, broker use, and investment style. Finally, the study documents that trades and returns are inversely related for value/contrarian managers and directly related for style-neutral and growth managers.  The second essay presents an analysis of how fund size affects investment performance. Recent studies find evidence that small funds outperform large funds. This fund size effect is commonly hypothesized to be caused by transaction costs. Due to the lack of transactions data, prior studies have investigated the transaction costs theory only indirectly. This study however, analyses the daily transactions of active Australian equity managers and finds aggregate market impact costs incurred by large managers are significantly greater than that Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by package formation and portfolio characteristics consistent with transaction cost intimidation. An analysis of the interaction between transaction cost intimidation and the fund size effect documents that large managers pursue a highly active trading strategy, and accordingly suffer more from the fund size effect than is the case for large funds following a less active trading strategy. This suggests the fund size effect is related to transaction costs as trading activity is a good proxy for expected market impact.  Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by fund managers to trade. While a number of recent mutual fund performance studies find data, prior studies have investigated the transaction costs theory only indirectly. This study however, analyses the daily transactions of active Australian equity managers and finds aggregate market impact costs incurred by large managers are significantly greater than that Finally, the third essay examines the nature of price-sensitive earnings information used by package formation and portfolio characteristics consistent with transaction cost intimidation. An analysis of the interaction between transaction cost intimidation and the fund size effect documents that large managers pursue a highly active trading strategy, and accordingly suffer more from the fund size effect than is the case for large funds following a less active trading strategy. This suggests the fund size effect is related to transaction costs as trading activity is incurred by small managers. Furthermore, large managers exhibit preferences for trade evidence of outperformance relative to suitably constructed benchmarks, limited research exists as to whether such outperformance is due to privately collected information, or merely expedient interpretation of publicly released information. In this essay an examination of the trade sequences of fund managers around earnings announcements is performed, and evidence is presented revealing an increased Occurrence of buy-sell trade sequences around good announcements and vice versa for bad announcements. The results also show an increase in the frequency of fund managers not trading before announcements, only to subsequently purchase during good announcements. Taken together, this evidence suggests managers are reliant on private information before earnings announcements, as well as them engaging in 'interpretation' of earnings announcements when they do not receive a private signal.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Business.</field><field name="subject">Managers.</field><field name="subject">Investments.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of cultural learning during the hospital briefing process from a facilities management perspective</field><field name="creator">Chandra, Venny, Centre for Health Assets Australasia, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The continued development of Facilities Management (FM) as a profession largely depends on it playing a stronger strategic role in the decision-making of organisations. This requires the capability of better understanding the clients' facility needs and requirements, which ultimately means that Facilities Managers must learn about the nature of clients' organisations and their organisational cultures. This study contends that in a project it is the briefing process that provides the greatest opportunity for cultural learning to occur, a process wherein it is important for the actors to converge upon shared understanding of facility needs and requirements. By focusing on culture at a cognitive rather than a behavioural level, this study has specifically attempted to identify the types of knowledge learned during a briefing process, to explore the process of cultural learning and the factors that encourage or impede such learning, and to produce an insight into the process.  A hospital partnering project was adopted as a case study for investigating the process of cultural learning during the briefing process. Using Nonaka's (1994) theory of Knowledge Creation, this study portrays the briefing process as one wherein the social processes during briefing facilitate the conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge in a cyclical way. Sackmann's (1991) categorisation of knowledge has been used to analyse the social interactions during briefing by dissecting the different levels of knowledge being shared. In support of the cognitive perspective of learning and the conceptual understanding of culture as mindsets or cognitions, Laukkanen's (1996) Comparative Cause Mapping method was used to measure the cultural learning occurring among members of both the FM and their clients' groups, using an in-depth inquiry into five key concepts during the briefing process. Data was collected longitudinally during the briefing process using real-time observations and semi-structured interviews which maximised the comparative measures of similarities and differences in the Cause Maps depicting cultural learning.  This integration of culture, learning, and briefing theories usmg Nonaka's (1994) knowledge creation theory, Sackmann's (1991) categorisation of knowledge, and Laukkanen's (1996) Comparative Cause Mapping method has produced interesting and useful insights into the process of cultural learning during the briefing process within a hospital partnering project. The study has found that significant cultural learning did take place during the briefing process and that partnering projects can present opportunities for this to occur. In particular, it is established that cultural learning is best conceived of as a process of social construction in which individuals, subgroups and groups engage in a collective approach to understanding facility needs and requirements. More specifically, briefing meetings were found to represent contexts for social interactions in which cultural learning took place. This learning occurred in constantly negotiated boundaries and through conflicts and disagreements, with actors competing in a dynamic process of social construction to have their version of understanding of the clients' needs and requirements prevail. The diverse client groups within the hospital context being studied provided a management opportunity for Facility Managers to act as 'mediators', which facilitated cultural learning. Finally, FM technical knowledge was shown to be an important tool for the FM group during the process of cultural learning as the participants negotiated their versions of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture.</field><field name="subject">Facility management.</field><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of multidrug transporters in childhood malignancies</field><field name="creator">Pajic, Marina, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the foremost causes of treatment failure in childhood malignancies. MDR is a multifactorial process, but classic resistance to cytotoxic drugs has most often been associated with over-expression of one or more MDR transporter proteins in malignant cells, conferring on them the ability to extrude an extraordinarily diverse array of endo- and xenobiotics out of the cell. The best characterized multidrug transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP), belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene superfamily, and have been previously implicated in the development of drug resistance in the clinical context. The work described herein examined the various aspects of the MDR genotype and phenotype in the childhood malignancies acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and neuroblastoma.  The first series of studies tested the hypothesis that morphine, a potential Pgp substrate, might influence the efficacy and/or toxicity of clinically used chemotherapy agents which are substrates for Pgp. The results, however, provided no evidence in a variety of human tumour cell lines of morphine influencing response to selected chemotherapeutic drugs. This finding is particularly important as morphine remains to be the opioid of choice for the treatment of cancer pain in the clinic.  The second series of studies examined the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MDR1 gene, encoding Pgp, and in the MRP1 gene, on patient outcome in childhood ALL or neuroblastoma, with a view to identifying novel prognostic markers for these malignancies. It was found that two of the examined SNPs in the MRP1 gene were associated with improved outcome in neuroblastoma, which had not previously been demonstrated in this disease. Moreover, each of the relevant MRP1 SNPs were associated with lower MRP1 gene expression in both patient samples and tumour cell lines, supporting previous studies indicating that low MRP1 expression in neuroblastoma is strongly associated with improved patient outcome. Importantly, the results of this study suggest a role for selected MRP1 polymorphisms in predicting clinical response in neuroblastoma.  Finally, a series of studies were undertaken, using both in vitro and in vivo model systems, to test the efficacy of putative small molecule inhibitors of the MRP1 gene and its transcriptional regulator, the MYCN oncogene, in neuroblastoma. These studies demonstrated for the first time the efficacy of a novel compound, 4H10, at reversing multidrug resistance either in cultured neuroblastoma cells, or in the MYCN transgenic mice, which develop neuroblastoma that closely mirror the human disease. The results indicate that inhibition of MRP1 function has potential clinical importance in the treatment of neuroblastoma, and therefore warrant further research in this area. In contrast, the results failed to provide evidence of the in vivo efficacy of the novel putative small molecule MYCN inhibitors analysed in these studies. Collectively, the findings of these studies contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of clinical drug resistance, and may help in the development of new approaches for risk assessment and treatment of aggressive childhood malignancies and thereby improve the long-term outlook of children diagnosed with these debilitating diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multidrug resistance.</field><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oligo-Miocene pseudocheirid diversity and the early evolution of ringtail possums (Marsupialia)</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Karen K, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The marsupial family Pseudocheiridae is currently known from seventeen species of six genera in Australia and New Guinea. These small to medium-sized arboreal animals are nocturnal and folivorous. Extinct pseudocheirids are recognised from several mid to late Cenozoic fossil localities across Australia and New Guinea. The single largest collection of pseudocheirid fossils has been recovered from the Oligo-Miocene freshwater carbonates of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwest Queensland. This collection, which includes the first pseudocheirid cranial fossils, forms the basis of this investigation. Three new extinct pseudocheirid genera together containing four species are identified and described. Six new species of Paljara, Marlu and Pildra are also described from Riversleigh. Two of the new Marlu species are reported from South Australia??s Leaf Locality. From Riversleigh, Marlu kutjamarpensis is identified and additional material of Paljara tirarensae and P. nancyhawardae documented. New species attributed to Marlu and Pildra necessitate revision of those genera. Cranial material is identified for three of the new species. The rostrum of archaic pseudocheirids is shorter than in extant forms but cranial morphology is similar overall. Phylogenetic relationships of all extinct pseudocheirids are analysed. They include all new and previously described species, most of which have never been examined in a parsimony-based analysis. Two hypotheses of pseudocheirid evolution are presented: a paired lineage hypothesis and a single lineage hypothesis. Both hypotheses demonstrate that species of Paljara are not the most plesiomorphic pseudocheirids, Marlu praecursor does not cluster with other species of Marlu, the new genus Gawinga is most closely related to Paljara and there are no representatives of the extant genus Pseudochirops in any pre-Pliocene locality. All extant pseudocheirids cluster to form a crown clade sister to a stem lineage of Pseudokoala and Marlu species. Pseudocheirids are found in all Oligo-Miocene faunal zones of Riversleigh. Species of Paljara and Marlu are most frequently recovered from Faunal Zone B and C deposits respectively. Four pseudocheirid species biostratigraphically correlate the Kutjamarpu local fauna of the Leaf Locality with Faunal Zones B and C of Riversleigh, suggesting an early to middle Miocene age for both deposits. Modern pseudocheirids first evolved no later than the late Miocene from a descendant of the Marlu + Pseudokoala lineage when all other Oligo-Miocene pseudocheirids became extinct. At least three pseudocheirid lineages dispersed to New Guinea approximately five million years ago, but ecological barriers probably prevented subsequent migrations between the two landmasses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Riversleigh</field><field name="subject">Marsupialia</field><field name="subject">Pseudocheiridae</field><field name="subject">Miocene</field><field name="subject">Ringtail possum</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Cenozoic</field><field name="subject">Petauroidea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of inflammation-associated S100 proteins in fibroblasts and their expression in atherosclerosis</field><field name="creator">Rahimi, Ahmed Farid, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The multigene family of Ca2+-binding S100 proteins comprises 22 members that have various important intra- and extracellular roles. The three inflammation-associated members of this family???S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 (collectively termed &amp;quotcalgranulins&amp;quot)???are constitutive neutrophil and monocyte proteins also expressed by macrophages within acute and chronic inflammatory lesions, but not in tissue macrophages. They are expressed in human/murine wounds and by appropriately activated macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes in vitro. The &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot are implicated in leukocyte activation/deactivation, fatty acid transport, leukocyte/fibroblast chemotaxis, transmigration and adhesion, embryogenesis, wound healing, protection against oxidants and antibacterial defence. Chapter 3 of this thesis explores growth-factor- and cytokine-mediated regulation and expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in fibroblasts, and demonstrates spatio-temporal expression of S100A8 in rat dermal wounds. Fibroblasts are stromal resident cells with important regulatory immune-inflammatory functions in wound healing, tissue remodelling and fibrosis. Fibroblast migration, proliferation, differentiation and their synthetic repertoire are modulated by various factors including extracellular matrix components, growth factors, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and cytokines. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), interleukin-1?(IL-1? and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are potent fibroblast mitogens; PDGF and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-? are fibroblast chemoattractants. FGF-2 and IL-1?promote fibroblast proliferation, whereas TGF-?promotes myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon ?(IFN?, tumour-necrosis factor ? (TNF?, TGF-?and PDGF did not induce the S100A8 gene in fibroblasts whereas FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) maximally induced mRNA 12 hr. after stimulation and this declined over 36 hr. The FGF-2 response was strongly enhanced and prolonged by optimal levels of heparin (1-10 IU/ml), maximally at 18 hr. post-stimulation. FGF-2/heparin-induced responses depended on cell-cell contact in vitro. IL-1?(10 U/ml) alone, or in synergy with FGF-2/heparin strongly induced the gene in 3T3 and primary fibroblasts. Dexamethasone (10???6 M) enhanced LPS- and FGF-2/-IL-1?induced responses. S100A9 mRNA was not induced by any of these mediators. Induction of S100A8 in the absence of S100A9 was confirmed in primary fibroblast-like cells by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction. FGF-2-heparin- and IL-1?induced mRNA expression depended on de-novo protein synthesis and was partially mediated by the mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway of activation. Preliminary promoter deletion analyses indicated that FGF-2-responsive elements in the gene promoter were distinct from those responsive to IL-1? TGF-?(2 ng/ml) significantly suppressed gene induction mediated by FGF-2 ?heparin/LPS/dexamethasone, but not by IL-1? TGF-?may compromise mRNA stability. Protein levels in FGF-2-heparin-IL-1?stimulated fibroblasts correlated well with mRNA levels and expression was mainly cytoplasmic. Immunohistochemistry indicated S100A8 associated with keratinocytes, neutrophils, macrophage-like cells and some hair follicles in wounded rat skin. Rat wounds also contained numerous S100A8- positive fibroblast-like cells 2 and 4 days post-injury; numbers declined by 7 days. Upregulation of S100A8 by FGF-2/IL-1? down-regulation by TGF-? and time-dependent expression of S100A8 in wound fibroblasts suggest a role in fibroblast differentiation at sites of inflammation and repair. Intracellular fibroblast-derived S100A8 may also regulate intracellular redox equilibrium and antioxidant defence. Atherosclerosis is a progressive chronic disease with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. S100A1 and S100B are associated with dendritic cells and lymphocytes in experimental rodent and human atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes and macrophages in plaques of ApoE???/??? mice express S100A9 but not S100A8. Myeloperoxidase and HOClmediated oxidative mechanisms are fundamental in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and S100A8 is exquisitely sensitive to HOCl oxidation which generates sulphinamide bonds, novel non-reducible cysteine-lysine covalent bonds. Chapter 4 of this thesis presents novel evidence that, in contrast to the murine ApoE???/??? model, the three human &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot were expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques, but not in normal arteries. High levels of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were evident in macrophages and foam cells. Some neovessels were anti-S100A8-/anti-S100A9-immunoreactive; S100A9 staining was also evident on the extracellular matrix. Patterns of expression of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were overlapping in serial sections, except that only smooth muscle cells were S100A12-positive. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA were also expressed by macrophages, foam cells and endothelial cells, indicating gene up-regulation rather than passive protein uptake. Western blotting of plaque extracts revealed monomeric S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 and larger complexes. Some were resistant to reduction, suggesting non-disulfide covalent cross-linking, possibly via sulphinamide bonds. Stable S100A8-S100A9 complexes were also detected after immunoaffinity purification. In an in-vitro system, molar ratios of HOCl of &amp;gt1 generated stable complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 whereas ~800 and ~100-fold excess HOCl oxidises apolipoprotein B-100 and BSA, respectively. S100A8 and S100A9 protected low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against HOCl oxidation in a thiol-independent manner. Because HOCl-oxidised S100s did not contain epitopes recognised by an antibody used to detect HOCl-oxidised proteins in plaque, levels of oxidised proteins in plaque are likely to be significantly greater than described. S100A8 and S100A9 may protect LDL by functioning as HOCl-scavengers. However, chronic oxidative cross-linking of S100A8 and S100A9 with other proteins and extracellular matrix components may contribute to plaque pathogenesis. These studies support key roles for the &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot in chronic inflammation, wound healing and atherogenesis possibly by regulating cellular differentiation, activation and modulation of redox-dependent mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Calcium-binding proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the citation impact of clinical neurology journals using structural equation modeling with partial least squares</field><field name="creator">Yue, Weiping, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ongoing debate on the evaluative role of citation analysis and the theory of citation recognizes that the citation process is complex and that citation counts are affected by certain extra-scientific or external factors. To date, little effort has been made to explore the effects of various external factors; this thesis addresses this lack. In the context of the various perspectives on citations and citation analysis, this study uses journals as the unit of analysis and investigates what, how, and to what extent extra-scientific factors influence the citation impact of journals. An integrated conceptual model of Journal Citation Impact that takes into account current theoretical positions and prior empirical research findings is developed. It addresses the interrelationships between Journal Citation Impact and a range of external factors (Journal Properties, Journal Visibility, Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, Journal Selectivity, Journal Promptness, Journal Editorial Prestige, and Perceived Journal Quality). The proposed conceptual model is novel in that it: (1) incorporates nearly all possible external factors that affect Journal Citation Impact; (2) addresses the complex interrelationships between a number of external factors and Journal Citation Impact in one model; (3) regards both Journal Citation Impact and its external factors as theoretical constructs; and (4) identifies the observed variables of the external factors and Journal Citation Impact. However, because of the difficulties in operationalizing all the theoretical constructs, this conceptual model is simplified to an operational model for empirical testing. The operational model includes the construct Journal Citation Impact and four of its external factors, Journal Properties, Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, and Perceived Journal Quality. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to test the operational model with empirical data from 41 research journals in clinical neurology. Data are collected from bibliographic database searching, web searching, printed journals, and from a web-based survey that was conducted to obtain information on perceptions of journal quality. Empirical results of the operational model show that Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, and Perceived Journal Quality have large, medium, and small effects respectively on Journal Citation Impact, thus indicating that certain extra-scientific factors can influence Journal Citation Impact significantly. The findings suggest that great care should be taken in interpreting and evaluating the results obtained from citation analysis. In terms of Journal Citation Impact, this research also suggests that various journal citation indicators should be ii used to reflect different aspects of citation impact. By exploring the phenomenological domain in the citing process, this exploratory study not only provides a better understanding of citation analysis, it also contributes to the development of the theory of citation. From the methodological perspective, introducing SEM with PLS to Informetrics and Scientometrics also contributes to the knowledge base of these fields. Pragmatically, the research findings will enhance the judgment of researchers and practitioners such as editors, publishers, librarians and other information specialists in assessing journal performance. Finally, the worldwide survey findings on peer assessment of journal outlets in clinical neurology will be useful for researchers, academics or clinicians in this field.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bibliographical citations</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Periodicals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of bone defect models in immunodeficient animals</field><field name="creator">Gan, Jade Ho Yue, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bone defects resulting from non-unions, fractures, significant revision joint replacements, tumour resection and osteolysis present a clinical problem. While autografts are considered the gold standard, ubiquitous use of this reparative technique is limited by graft supply and site morbidity. Recent progresses in tissue engineering using stem cells, bone enhancing molecules and gene therapy have provided more hypotheses for bone defect treatment. In vivo assessment to test these hypotheses requires animal models to mimic human conditions. Immunodeficient or nude animals have the advantage of hosting materials from human and other xenographic origins without immuno-intolerance or rejection. A thorough understanding of the biology in nude animals is vital for the further advancement of connective tissue healing and regeneration strategies. Nude mice are excellent xenographic hosts for in- vivo characterisation and provide a reproducible animal source. The immune deficiencies of nude compared to normal animals may however, influence bone healing and need to be addressed. This dissertation (a) investigated potential bone defect models in nude mice and nude rats (b) incorporated the selected bone defect model to evaluate the effect of T cell deficiency and age on bone defect healing in nude animals (c) determined the feasibility of a critical size defect (CSD) in nude mice. A distal-femur-condylar-defect (DFCD) model was successfully performed in nude mice and rats. The model was found to have some advantages as a bone defect model: (1) located at a weight-bearing skeletal site (2) no requirements for an internal or external fixator (3) does not obstruct or limit mobility (4) location is not in close proximity to any major organs such as the brain (5) easy identification of surface anatomy (6) defect size is standardised and reproducible (7) does not require lengthy and complicated surgery and (8) cost effective. This dissertation confirmed that bone healing in nude mice is similar to that of normal immunocompetent mice. Absence of T lymphocytes did not delay or inhibit bone repair. Use of older nude mice did not seem to affect the healing rate, in contrast to older normal mice, which showed delay in bone healing in the initial phase. Establishment of critical sized defects in mice at a weight-bearing location was not feasible due to the robust healing of murine. This dissertation recommends that the DFCD model could be utilized for the assessment of xenogenic materials at early time point.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone-grafting</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion.

The primary objectives of this research are to investigate the most suitable underground methods applicable to inclined thick seams in the Quangninh coalfield and to improve understanding of the operational and geotechnical issues associated with the application of chosen methods in thick seams with steeply dipping conditions.  From a risk and operational assessment, the Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) method is considered most appropriate for inclined thick seams under the current mining conditions in Vietnam. The LTCC method offers great potential for the efficient extraction of thick seams by caving coal from the upper section during the mining of the lower section. This significantly reduces the development cost per tonne. Compared to High reach Single Pass Longwalling, the LTCC method offers a low extraction height, resulting in smaller and less expensive equipment and better face conditions.  Results from this study identified that for extracting an inclined thick seam, the face retreating along the strike has better operational advantages and better cavability than the face retreating updip or downdip of the seam. The operational issues of the LTCC method when extracting inclined seams are: the stability of the support, transport in the mine, and the difficulties in roof control at the transition between face ends and the gateroads.  In terms of geotechnical issues, better cavability of the top coal is anticipated for flat coal seams compared to inclined seams. In addition, the chain pillar for flat coal seams is subjected to a higher vertical stress distribution than that of inclined ones.  An improved cavability assessment method for the categorisation of the cavability of the top coal with four categories, ranging from 1 (excellent cavability) to 4 (very poor cavability), was suggested to assist the feasibility and design stages of the LTCC application. The cavability assessment method was conducted by numerical analysis combined with back analysis from the database obtained from past LTCC practices.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thick coal seam</field><field name="subject">Longwall Top Coal Caving</field><field name="subject">Inclined thick seam</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of gene therapy to flap preservation</field><field name="creator">Roman, Sandrine, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Reconstructive flaps are a mainstay form of treatment for anatomical defects in plastic surgery, and despite extensive progress in the areas of flap anatomy and design, the mechanism of flap healing and the factors that regulate this process are poorly understood. This thesis investigates the regulation of flap healing, and tests the hypothesis that the introduction of genes for angiogenic growth factors can be used to augment the vascularisation and wound healing of ischaemic flaps. Using a modified McFarlane ischaemic skin flap model in Sprague Dawley rats, endogenous angiogenic regulatory factors that included the VEGF and angiopoietin families and their receptors were investigated. Twelve specific quantitative real-time PCR assays documented a general up-regulation of angiogenic genes and their receptors with time following flap elevation. There was not a readily identifiable &#147;master regulator&#148;. Angiogenic protein levels were more variable with a decrease VEGF-A and TNF-&#945; levels along the flap. Debridement studies of the necrotic distal flaps demonstrated for the first time that VEGF-A164 and TNF-&#945; protein levels stabilised, while angiogenic genes of VEGF-A164, VEGF-A120, angiopoietins and their receptors were down-regulated and VEGF-B186 and HIF-1&#945; mRNA increased, compared to non-debrided flaps. Leucocyte proteolysis in devitalised tissue is discussed as a possible mechanism for reduced angiogenic proteins levels in ischaemic flaps.  The impact of angiogenic gene therapy using adenoviral vectors in the flap model revealed for the first time that recombinant adenoviruses containing the VEGF-B186 transgene could significantly augment neovascularisation and improve flap survival. This neovascularisation correlated with up-regulation of the expression of multiple endogenous angiogenic genes that included VEGF-A164, the angiopoietins and their receptors. Erythematous plaques were documented as a side effect of Ad VEGF-A165 and Ad VEGF-B186 treatment of rat skin, although in the latter treatment they were very mild. Weals induced by the presence of VEGF-A165 transgene were associated with a marked acute inflammatory cell infiltrate and oedema consistent with the increased vascular permeability effects of VEGF-A165. Ad VEGF-A165 plus Ad ANG-1* induced weals were less prominent with reduced oedema highlighting the stabilising effect of Ad ANG-1* on vascular permeability.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VEGF</field><field name="subject">Gene therapy</field><field name="subject">Angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">Angiopoietin</field><field name="subject">TNF</field><field name="subject">Protein</field><field name="subject">Gene</field><field name="subject">Ischaemic flap</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fundamental investigation of slag/carbon interactions in electric arc furnace steelmaking process</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Muhammad Mahfuzur, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates the interactions of carbonaceous materials (metallurgical coke, natural graphite and HDPE/coke blends) with three EAF slags [FeO: 24% to 32%]. Experiments were conducted using the sessile drop technique (1500??C-1600??C) with off-gases (CO, CO2) measured using an IR analyzer; the wetting behaviour was determined from contact angle measurements. Estimation of slag foaming behaviour was determined from the droplet volume changes calculated using specialized software. At 1550??C, all slags were non-wetting with coke due to increased surface tension due to sulphur. At 1550??C, slag 1 was initially non-wetting on natural graphite due to gas entrapment in the slag droplet; the wetting improved after that. Other slags showed comparatively better wetting. At 1600??C, all slags were non-wetting with coke. Slags showed a shift from non-wetting to wetting behaviour with natural graphite. Slag/coke reactions produced high off-gases levels causing extensive FeO reduction; gas entrapment in the slag was poor (small volume droplets). Slag/natural graphite interactions revealed both slow gas generation rates and FeO reduction, and excellent gas entrapment (higher droplet volumes) with minor changes in slag properties due to low ash levels. The iron oxide reduction rates were determined to be 1.54x10-5 and 4.2x10-6 mol.cm-2/sec (Slag 1, 1550??C) for metallurgical coke and natural graphite respectively. Slag interactions with coke/HDPE blends showed increasing off-gas levels with increasing HDPE levels. Blend#3 produced the highest off-gas levels, extensive FeO reduction and displayed significantly higher slag foaming and better wetting compared to coke. Our line on trends compared well for slag/carbon interactions and resulted in deceased specific energy consumption and carbon usage and increased productivity. These findings have enhanced the possibility of utilizing polymeric wastes in blends with coke in EAF steelmaking for slag/carbon interactions.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Slag foaming injectant</field><field name="subject">EAF steelmaking</field><field name="subject">Slag foaming</field><field name="subject">Gas generation</field><field name="subject">Met.

Many studies recognise motivation, in the everyday sense, as a factor affecting stroke rehabilitation, but there is no standard measure. There is also no agreement as to whether motivation in the post-stroke period is the same as the absence of depression, anxiety or stress; hence the need for an independent measure of motivation.  Method  The Stroke Rehabilitation Motivation Scale was adapted from the 28-item Sports Motivation Scale, which in turn was developed according to the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to motivation identified by Self-Determination Theory.  The resulting Stroke Rehabilitation Motivation Scale was tested in two stages. In the 28-item reliability stage, in a sample of 18 stroke patients from the stroke ward of Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital, the scale was tested for Inter-rater reliability, scale reliability, and validity via comparison of high vs. low motivation groups according to a novel ???motivation score???. The scale was shortened from 28-items (four per subscale) to 7 items (one per subscale) by selecting the most reliable items.  The three intrinsic and extrinsic subscales were summed and averaged, and the amotivation score was subtracted from this to produce a ???motivation score???, such that a person with a positive score had more motivation, either extrinsic or intrinsic, than they had amotivation.  e.g.	[ ( E + I )/2 ??? A ]  In the 7-item reliability stage, a further 13 patients were recruited from Bankstown-Lidcombe and Liverpool Hospitals. The 7-item scale was tested for scale reliability, and for validity by comparison of high vs. low motivation groups as well as correlations between motivation score, anxiety, depression and stress, and rehabilitation outcomes.  Results  In both the 28-item and 7-item stages the scale demonstrated adequate to very good reliability. There was a lack of significant mean differences or correlations to demonstrate validity in either stage; this study does not represent a convincing demonstration of validity of the SRMS. However, it would appear that motivation is conceptually distinct from depression, anxiety and stress, and the scale definitely warrants further testing in a larger sample.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The bison in the room</field><field name="creator">Novak, Karolina Noemi, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Living with two cultures can be like living with the proverbial elephant in your living room. In my case, being born in Sydney and never having visited the country of my parents?? origin, it feels more like living with Wittgenstein??s rhinoceros. Except that my rhinoceros is a bison. What is this living, breathing beast of an ancestry, this culture, this sometimes palpable sense of history? How real is it? Is it really there? Is whether or not it is there relevant? Is it itself relevant? How do you, and how can you interact with it? How do you grapple with these questions surrounding its ontology, especially when they are so closely tied to your own sense of being? What impact does it have on how you construct yourself, when the rhinocero-bison that you live with is invisible, when you can only access it through description, when you have no choice but to trust a kooky European philosopher with a quick temper and a thick accent who only refuses to admit that it is not there.  As a child, you embrace this animal for all its mystery, splendour, adventure, majesty, and because through it you feel affirmed, connected, and somehow, perhaps ironically, real. Though as you grow older and learn and understand more and more, you may realise the philosopher, and his mathematician friend, had more tricks up his sleeve, more secrets to hide, than you ever knew. And this animal may begin to fade like the colour in sun-worn fabric, diminish in depth and presence like an evaporating puddle. It may begin to resemble a ghost of something that may have never even been, little more than some kind of benevolent phantom that the light passes right through, leaving only the feint whisper of a shadow. But is this because it is no longer real, or you no longer believe in it? Is it because you can now see through the romantic notions you attached to it as a child? Did it ever even exist, or was its image imprinted on the surface of your childhood rose-coloured glasses? Is it dead? Have you killed it? Can you bring it back to life?  These are some of the questions addressed in my Masters of Fine Arts theoretical and studio research. The body of work presented in conjunction with this exegesis addresses some of my personal experience of the convergence of two worlds and the dilemma of imagination afforded by this convergence, particularly as located in childhood. It investigates some of the properties of this location, and its transmutation over time from something very real and tangible to a memory, and from a memory to a fondly, meticulously preserved fabrication.  This paper serves firstly to provide exegesis for my studio practice. It also touches on recent tendencies in contemporary artistic practices with which my studio research perhaps aligns itself, and certain recent and historical social and cultural phenomena that inform and inspire it. This component of my research provides the secondary impetus for this paper, which is an investigation into some of these tendencies as illustrative of more significant trends in cultural attitudes and the artmaking that reflects them.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An addressless reconfigurable routing architecture for fast FPGA reconfigurations</field><field name="creator">Kuo, Jenny Yi-Chun, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to develop a hardware support which enables faster run-time partial reconfigurations for reconfigurable systems. The current configuration routing architecture of the reconfigurable systems imposes considerable amount of overheads by loading more configuration data than required onto the configuration memory. The overheads can be as costly as contributing up to 98.5% of the configuration latency. This leads to one of the major shortcomings in current FPGA technologies. Therefore, in order to increase the efficiency of run-time reconfiguration systems, it is crucial to reduce the reconfiguration overhead by reducing the lengths of the reconfiguration bitstreams. In this thesis, the reconfiguration bitstreams are minimized by two techniques: the concept of partial reconfigurations and the reduced reconfiguration granularities.  The proposed configuration routing system provides efficient access to non-contiguous reconfigurable locations in reconfigurable systems. It reduces the amount of configuration data in a partial reconfiguration bitstream by removing all the addressing information and pad zeroes which are present in Virtex-4 partial bitstreams. The system allows variable frame set sizes as well as variable reconfiguration granularities, thereby providing sufficient scalability and flexibility. The proposed system is readily applicable to SRAM-based FPGAs. The major advantage of the proposed system over the Virtex-4 architecture is the ability to reduce the configuration data significantly without additional addressing information when the reconfiguration granularities are small. The experimental results and simulations show that a proposed system with its hardware cost less than 50% of the Virtex-4 configuration routing architecture achieves speedups of up to 14.84% over the Virtex-4 devices when the reconfiguration granularity equals to a Virtex-4 frame. Moreover, the speedups increase up to 17.33% when the granularity is set to half of a Virtex-4 frame, and up to 56.51% when the granularity is set to a quarter of a Virtex-4 frame while maintaining the same hardware cost.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of bacteria associated with Australian wine grapes using cultural and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Bae, Sung Sook, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a systematic investigation of bacterial species associated with wine grapes cultivated in Australian vineyards during 2001-2004. Grapes, sampled throughout cultivation, were analysed for bacterial species using a combination of cultural and molecular methods. Red (Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot) and white (Chardonnay, Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc) grape varieties were examined. Factors affecting the bacterial ecology of grapes were considered. The bacterial populations of mature undamaged grapes at harvest were consistently low at 102-103 CFU/g. Higher populations (103-106 CFU/g) were found on grapes at earlier stages of maturity and correlated with application of Bacillus thuringiensis as a biological pesticide. B. thuringiensis was the most prevalent bacterial species on wine grapes throughout cultivation, as determined by plate culture, enrichment culture and PCR-DGGE. B. thuringiensis carried over into wine processing but did not grow in juice or wine and did not adversely affect the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Oenococcus oeni in liquid culture. B. thuringiensis inhibited the growth of several spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi found on grapes. Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens was the second most prevalent species detected on wine grapes. Its populations rarely exceeded 103-104 CFU/g. Other bacteria (Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas) were sporadically found on grapes. Lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria were rarely detected on undamaged grapes by culture and PCR-DGGE methods. A greater incidence of lactic acid bacteria was detected by specific enrichment procedures, especially on damaged grape berries. Species found were Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus mali, Lactobacillus lindneri and Lactobacillus kunkeei. The malolactic organism, O. oeni, was never isolated from any grape sample, raising questions about its enological origin. Enrichment cultures also revealed the presence of other bacteria (e.g. Sporolactobacillus inulinus, Asaia siamensis) not previously found on wine grapes. Atypical, hot and dry conditions during cultivation may account for the low populations of bacteria found on wine grapes. This factor combined with the overwhelming presence of B. thuringiensis prevented meaningful comparisons of data to determine influences of vineyard location, grape variety, grape maturity, climate and viticultural practices on the bacterial ecology of grapes. More systematic and controlled studies of these variables are required.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapes</field><field name="subject">bacteria</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of the human cytochrome P450 2J2 gene by activator protein-1</field><field name="creator">Marden, Nicole Yvonne, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes catalyses the oxidative metabolism of lipophilic xenobiotics such as drugs and environmental chemicals, and also plays an essential role in the biosynthesis and metabolism of endogenous compounds such as cholesterol and bile acids, vitamins, steroids, arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2) is a recently identified member of the human CYP protein family that is highly expressed in the heart, vasculature, liver and other tissues. CYP2J2 metabolises arachidonic acid (AA) into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have a number of potent biological activities including cytoprotective, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Given its widespread tissue distribution and the biological actions of EETs, CYP2J2 is likely to play an important role in cellular physiology, and altered expression of CYP2J2 may have pathophysiological consequences. Indeed, recent literature studies have indicated that CYP2J2 protein levels are decreased in vascular endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and that maintenance of CYP2J2 expression enhances cell survival. Thus, CYP2J2 expression may be impaired in diseases or conditions associated with decreased oxygen availability, such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke and atherosclerosis, and this may contribute to their pathogenic consequences. Despite its likely importance in human physiology and pathophysiology, very little is known about the regulation of CYP2J2 gene expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control expression of the CYP2J2 gene. In particular, this study was designed to identify factors that regulate the expression of the CYP2J2 gene in the liver-derived HepG2 cell line during normoxia and hypoxia. A 2.4 kb fragment of the 5???-flanking region of the CYP2J2 gene (corresponding to nucleotides -2341 to +98, relative to the translation start site) was isolated from a human genomic library. Automated searching of the upstream regulatory region of CYP2J2 identified several putative binding sites for the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Because AP-1 activity is altered in hypoxia, the possibility that AP-1 may participate in the regulation of CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia was explored. Cell culture studies examined the relationship between the expression of CYP2J2, and the  AP-1 genes c-fos and c-jun, in HepG2 cells cultured in normoxia and hypoxia. Down-regulation of CYP2J2 mRNA and protein in hypoxic HepG2 cells was associated with the pronounced up-regulation of c-Fos protein from an undetectable level in normoxic cells; c-Jun protein levels were readily detectable in normoxia, and were also increased in hypoxia. Transient transfection studies revealed distinct effects of Fos and Jun proteins on CYP2J2 promoter activity. While the CYP2J2 promoter was strongly activated by c-Jun, c-Fos was inactive, and also abolished gene transactivation elicited by c-Jun. These results suggest that the constitutively expressed c-Jun is important in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia stimulates the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which do not support CYP2J2 transcription, leading to gene down-regulation. Experiments with CYP2J2 promoter deletion constructs revealed that the region between -152 to -50 bp relative to the translation start site was crucial for activation of CYP2J2 by c-Jun. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transfection studies identified two distinct elements within this region that were involved in c-Jun-dependent transactivation: an AP-1-like element at -56 to -63 bp, and an atypical AP-1 element at -105 to -95 bp. c-Jun homodimers interacted specifically with both elements. Separate mutagenesis of either element significantly impaired c-Jun-dependent transactivation of CYP2J2, while mutagenesis of both elements eliminated c-Jun-responsiveness. EMSAs established that c-Jun, but not c-Fos, interacted with both elements in normoxic HepG2 cells. Furthermore, mutagenesis of either c-Jun-response element significantly decreased the basal transcriptional activity of the CYP2J2 promoter in HepG2 cells, while mutagenesis of both elements almost completely suppressed basal promoter activity. These findings indicate a pivotal role for c-Jun in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. Transfection studies indicated that c-Fos suppresses c-Jun-dependent activation of CYP2J2 at both the -56/-63 bp and -105/-95 bp c-Jun-response elements. However, c-Fos-dependent inhibition appears to be mediated by distinct mechanisms at these two regulatory elements. While both elements interacted with c-Jun homodimers, only the -105/-95 bp element was able to interact with c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers. Thus, the up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia, and the shift from c-Jun homodimers to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, directly decreased c-Jun binding and transactivation at the -56/-63 bp element. In contrast, up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia altered the composition of proteins bound at the -105/-95 bp element from c-Jun to c-Fos/c-Jun. Inhibition of promoter activity occurs because c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers can occupy, but not transactivate, the CYP2J2 promoter via the -105/-95 bp element.  In summary, this thesis provides novel information on the molecular mechanisms that control the differential expression of the human CYP2J2 gene in normoxia and hypoxia. In particular, this study has established that the AP-1 proteins c-Jun and c-Fos play a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter in response to cellular stress. Binding of c-Jun to two distinct c-Jun-response elements within the CYP2J2 proximal promoter induces transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 gene and is essential for maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia promotes the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which inhibit transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter by c-Jun, thus contributing to decreased CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia. Impaired expression of CYP2J2 may contribute to cellular injury in diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for mediating altered CYP2J2 expression may eventually lead to therapeutic strategies that manipulate the expression of this important human gene.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">genetic transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene studies in epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Matthew W, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited blistering diseases that share the common feature of blister formation subsequent to normal mechanical insult of the epidermis. Despite two decades of investigation at both epidemiological and genetic levels, there remains much yet to be uncovered about the pathophysiology of this disease. This research had dual aims. Firstly, by enrolling patients in Australia and New Zealand with the simplex type of EB (EBS) in a screening programme in conjunction with a highly detailed review of the EB and intermediate filament literatures, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype in EBS. Secondly, we attempted to evaluate the use of baculoviral vectors as a means of introducing the type VII collagen cDNA into human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Among the EBS patients screened we identified a novel multi residue deletion in keratin 5 which led to a surprisingly mild form of epidermolysis bullosa Dowling ??? Meara. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of epidermal tissue from the affected individual showed that the mutant transcript was present at levels 2.7 fold higher than the wild type transcript. We demonstrated a family in which the presence of a previously reported keratin 14 mutation A413T appeared to induce disease expression in only one of the three individuals found to carry the mutations. We also identified two EBS families with no mutations in either keratin 5 or keratin 14. This is the first study to analyse EB patients from New Zealand and the first to report the presence of a deletion mutation in the 2B domain of keratin 5. The results of our type VII collagen transfer work showed that baculoviruses can be engineered to contain insert sequences in excess of 10kb and are able to gain entry to both human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Electron microscopy and analyses of the baculoviral vectors showed that the lack of protein expression subsequent to infection of human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes is likely due to the inability of the vector to escape cytoplasmic endosomes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="subject">genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic analysis of consumer buyer behaviour in urban China</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Simon, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has experienced rapid economic growth and is now arguably the world???s largest consumer market. However, despite the size and potential of the Chinese market, there is a serious lack of formal understanding of Chinese buyer behaviour. The broad aim of this research is to understand patterns of buyer behaviour through a systematic analysis of the purchasing of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) by urban Chinese consumers. Several specific research questions are addressed: ??? What patterns of brand purchasing and brand loyalty do urban Chinese consumers exhibit? ??? Do these patterns generalise across content, spatial and temporal dimensions? ??? Are there any systematic significant bases of segmentation within the FMCG markets that are studied? ??? What key implications are to be drawn by academics and practitioners? ??? More generally, what is the value of adopting a systematic approach to research in this area of enquiry? ??? Also, what is the value of applying and extending models developed in the West to the Chinese consumer context? The research is divided into two main studies. The first involves secondary consumer panel data and focuses on brand purchasing and loyalty behaviour. Analysis is conducted using the Dirichlet model, which provides theoretical predictions for a range of brand performance measures. The second study involves primary consumer panel data and  examines potential bases of segmentation. Analysis is based on the Generalised Dirichlet Model, which enables the impact of covariates on buyer behaviour to be assessed. It is found that the patterns of Chinese buyer behaviour for FMCGs are generally similar to those in the West. Results unique to the Chinese market are also identified. Importantly, the results and patterns generalise across all dimensions of analysis (that is, for brands within product categories, store types and store chains, and in different regions and cities, and in different time periods). Also, there is a lack of consumer segmentation among directly competing brands within the product categories that are studied.

(Luck et al. 2003). The use of agents as a metaphor for designing and constructing software systems represents an innovative movement in the field of software engineering: ???Agent- Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)??? (Lind 2000; Luck et al. 2003). This research contributes to the evolution of AOSE by proposing a comprehensive ontology-based methodology for the analysis and design of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The methodology is named MOBMAS, which stands for ???Methodology for Ontology-Based MASs???. A major improvement of MOBMAS over the existing agentoriented MAS development methodologies is its explicit and extensive support for ontology-based MAS development. Ontologies have been widely acknowledged for their significant benefits to interoperability, reusability, MAS development activities (such as system analysis and agent knowledge modelling) and MAS operation (such as agent communication and reasoning). Recognising these desirable ontology???s benefits, MOBMAS endeavours to identify and implement the various ways in which ontologies can be used in the MAS development process and integrated into the MAS model definitions. In so doing, MOBMAS has exploited ontologies to enhance its MAS development process and MAS development product with various strengths. These strengths include those ontology???s benefits listed above, and those additional benefits uncovered by MOBMAS, e.g. support for verification and validation, extendibility, maintainability and reliability. Compared to the numerous existing agent-oriented methodologies, MOBMAS is the first that explicitly and extensively investigates the diverse potential advantages of ontologies in MAS development, and which is able to implement these potential advantages via an ontology-based MAS development process and a set of ontology-based MAS model definitions. Another major contribution of MOBMAS to the field of AOSE is its ability to address all key concerns of MAS development in one methodological framework. The methodology provides support for a comprehensive list of methodological requirements,  which are important to agent-oriented analysis and design, but which may not be wellsupported by the current methodologies. These methodological requirements were identified and validated by this research from three sources: the existing agent-oriented methodologies, the existing evaluation frameworks for agent-oriented methodologies and conventional system development methodologies, and a survey of practitioners and researchers in the field of AOSE. MOBMAS supports the identified methodological requirements by combining the strengths of the existing agent-oriented methodologies (i.e. by reusing and enhancing the various strong techniques and model definitions of the existing methodologies where appropriate), and by proposing new techniques and model definitions where necessary. The process of developing MOBMAS consisted of three sequential research activities. The first activity identified and validated a list of methodological requirements for an Agent Oriented Software Engineering methodology as mentioned above. The second research activity developed MOBMAS by specifying a development process, a set of techniques and a set of model definitions for supporting the identified methodological requirements. The final research activity evaluated and refined MOBMAS by collecting expert reviews on the methodology, using the methodology on an application and conducting a feature analysis of the methodology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent agents (Computer software)</field><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restoration strategies and algorithms for survivable networks</field><field name="creator">Lau, Cheuk Wan William, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes new algorithms for restoration strategies that provision bandwidth guaranteed recovery for unicast and multicast connections. The primary focus is on online restoration strategies that sequentially do pre-planning of resource for each request using the current network resource state. Online restoration strategies do not require prior knowledge of all the requests like that of offline restoration strategies. Therefore, online restoration strategies are more suitable for on-demand and dynamic traffic engineering control. The proposed new algorithms are compared to known algorithms from literature. Most literature evaluates the performance of the algorithms with two metrics only: total bandwidth requirement and the number of requests accepted in the network. This thesis evaluates the algorithms in one additional dimension: the computational time. This is an important criterion when response times for establishing new connections are stringent. Each algorithm makes trade-off between computational complexity, bandwidth efficiency, and number of accepted requests. Results show that the proposed algorithms provide alternative trade-offs between the three performance metrics when compared to other existing algorithms. The alternatives provide more choice for the network providers and the best algorithm to use depends on the network's requirements. The restoration strategies used for unicast and multicast connections in this thesis are very compatible thus it is possible to integrate the restoration strategies into a single system where they share the same backup resources. Results from simulations show that using an integrated restoration model has significant benefits, which includes lower backup bandwidth requirement than the separate restoration model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">China Engages Global Health Governance: A Stakeholder or System-Transformer?</field><field name="creator">Chan, Lai-Ha</field><field name="description">Through the lens of public health, in particular HIV/AIDS, this research first scrutinises China&#146;s compliance with and resistance to the norms and rules embedded in the global health regime, and second, illustrates China&#146;s evolving global role and its intentions for global governance. China&#146;s response to its HIV/AIDS epidemic and its active engagement with the multilateral institutions of global health governance are attributable to both necessity and conscious design. While calling for and welcoming the involvement of multiple actors, a sine qua non for China&#146;s continued engagement with global governance and global health governance is that they should be conducted in accordance with the principles of national sovereignty, non-intervention and territorial integrity. Overall, while China does not seek any radical transformation of the prevailing world order, its vision for the global order is not compatible with that espoused by the West which attaches much weight to liberal democratic values thereby justifying the notion and practice of humanitarian intervention. With a preference for a Westphalian model of governance, China is not a &#145;responsible stakeholder&#146; in the liberal democratic order. Beijing advocates multilateral cooperation in a pluralist &#145;harmonious world&#146; and argues that there is no fixed universal blueprint for development. China adopts a twin strategy in its relations with the outside world. On the one hand, it seeks to defend itself from the encroachment of liberal values while maintaining friendly relations with the leading powers of the West; and on the other, to shore up the principles of national sovereignty and non-intervention as well as strengthen ties with Third World countries so as to consolidate a normative and political bulwark against liberal democratic values on the world stage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">global health governance</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">public health</field><field name="subject">global health regime</field><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100616.084909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of Fucoidin efficacy in A&#946;-peptide induced Alzheimer&#8217;s disease rodent model</field><field name="creator">Aarti Patel</field><field name="description">Abstract Alzheimer&#8217;s disease (AD) is a major public health concern worldwide, with an increasing prevalence in the elderly population. AD is a progressive neurological disorder of multi-faceted origin, where factors such as genetic mutations, biochemical changes, along with inflammatory cascade and soluble beta amyloid (A&#946;) peptide, are thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic failure and neuronal death, ultimately leading to cognitive and neuropsychiatric decline in patients suffering from the disease. At present, there is no long-term cure for the disease, although there is access to pharmacotherapy that might improve cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms early in the course of the disease. The current pharmacological therapy for AD only provides symptomatic relief for a very short period of time. It is therefore of utmost importance to discover other pharmacological strategies that might delay the development of AD and slow down the disease progression in terms of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. Elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms involved in AD neuropathogenesis is a major goal to find efficacious disease-modifying treatments. What remains to be understood completely are the intracellular pathways affected by A&#946; protein which may lead to neurodegeneration in AD. Since phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms are crucial in the &#946;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, protein kinase C has emerged as one of the key regulators of the APP metabolism. Indeed, dysregulation of the PKC pathway might play a role in the intracellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration, but their effective involvement still remains elusive. Therefore, a detailed analysis of PKC pathways in established models of AD neurodegeneration is necessary and will form part of this work. Fucoidin is a sulphated polysaccharide extracted from edible brown seaweed, which has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects as well as being a neuroprotectant in various inflammatory diseases including hypoxic ischemia, atherosclerosis and Heyman nephritis. Therefore, fucoidin may have an inhibitory effect on the inflammatory mechanisms of AD. Little is known, however, about the effect of fucoidin on AD. Animal models of AD are extremely valuable for the discovery and development of new treatments. Rodents have been one of the preferred models for pharmacological and behavioural studies in AD. In this thesis, first aim was to establish a non-transgenic A&#946;-induced AD model in rats. AD was induced utilising a published protocol which involved the bilateral injection of aggregated A&#946; (1-42) into the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus in rat brain. Behavioural assessment with well defined tools such as the Morris water maze and T-maze were utilised to assess the impairment in spatial working memory in rats. Behavioural impairments along with increased astrocytosis and microgliosis were observed in this particular A&#946;-induced AD model. In the established disease model, fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day) and ibuprofen (50 mg/kg/day) were shown to provide a partial protective effect on impairment in memory function in the MWM behavioural task in rats treated prior to disease initiation and throughout the course of the study. In addition, the histopathological and quantitative analysis of AD brain sections showed a marked reduction in reactive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and microglia in fucoidin (low and high dose) and ibuprofen treated A&#946; injected rats compared to untreated A&#946; injected rats. These results indicate that fucoidin may serve as a possible effective therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. There is strong evidence that PKC &#945; and &#949; signalling pathways regulate important molecular events in memory impairment and neurodegenerative pathophysiology in AD. A possible neuroprotective mechanism of fucoidin involving attenuation of an A&#946;-induced decrease in PKC &#949; phosphorylation using cultured SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells as a model system was examined. Co-administration of fucoidin (2&#956;M and 5 &#956;M) with A&#946; (1&#956;M) abolished the inhibitory effect of A&#946; on the phosphorylation of PKC&#949; in a concentration-dependent manner as revealed by western blot analysis. These findings suggest that a possible mechanism underpinning the neuroprotective effect of fucoidin may be through prevention of A&#61538;-induced inhibition of PKC phosphorylation and may serve as a possible therapeutic approach to improve AD symptoms. As cellular events that involve PKC are affected by A&#946; in in vitro systems, it was necessary to examine whether PKC activity is also modulated by the A&#946; treatment in vivo in our A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Therefore, the next aim was to assess the potential for fucoidin use as an intervention therapy in an established disease stage in the A&#946;-peptide induced AD model. Intervention with fucoidin (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) in the established disease stage partially prevented A&#946; (1-42) mediated damage with respect to memory impairment, neuroinflammation and PKC &#949; phosphorylation in the in vivo AD model consistent with the in vitro findings in SHSY5Y cells.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer Disease, amyloid beta peptide, fucoidin, PKC</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:177944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">BIRTHWEIGHT AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO CHRONIC DISEASE</field><field name="creator">Issa Al Salmi</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the relationship of birthweight to risk factors and markers, such as proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate, for chronic disease in postnatal life. It made use of the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab). The AusDiab study is a cross sectional study where baseline data on 11,247 participants were collected in 1999-2000. Participants were recruited from a stratified sample of Australians aged &#8805; 25 years, residing in 42 randomly selected urban and non-urban areas (Census Collector Districts) of the six states of Australia and the Northern Territory. The AusDiab study collected an enormous amount of clinical and laboratory data. During the 2004-05 follow-up AusDiab survey, questions about birthweight were included. Participants were asked to state their birthweight, the likely accuracy of the stated birthweight and the source of their stated birthweight. Four hundred and twelve chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were approached, and 339 agreed to participate in the study. The patients completed the same questionnaire. Medical records were reviewed to check the diagnoses, causes of kidney trouble and SCr levels. Two control subjects, matched for gender and age, were selected for each CKD patient from participants in the AusDiab study who reported their birthweight. Among 7,157 AusDiab participants who responded to the questionnaire, 4,502 reported their birthweights, with a mean (standard deviation) of 3.4 (0.7) kg. The benefit and disadvantages of these data are discussed in chapter three. The data were analysed for the relationship between birthweight and adult body size and composition, disorders of glucose regulation, blood pressure, lipid abnormalities, cardiovascular diseases and glomerular filtration rate. Low birthweight was associated with smaller body build and lower lean mass and total body water in both females and males. In addition low birthweight was associated with central obesity and higher body fat percentage in females, even after taking into account current physical activity and socioeconomic status. Fasting plasma glucose, post load glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin were strongly and inversely correlated with birthweight. In those with low birthweight (&lt; 2.5 kg), the risks for having impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes and all abnormalities combined were increased by 1.75, 2.22, 2.76 and 2.28 for females and by 1.40, 1.32, 1.98 and 1.49 for males compared to those with normal birthweight (&#8805; 2.5 kg), respectively. Low birthweight individuals were at higher risk for having high blood pressure &#8805; 140/90 mmHg and &#8805; 130/85 mmHg compared to those with normal birthweight. People with low birthweight showed a trend towards increased risk for high cholesterol (&#8805; 5.5 mmol/l) compared to those of normal birthweight. Females with low birthweight had increased risk for high low density lipoprotein cholesterol (&#8805; 3.5 mmol/l) and triglyceride levels (&#8805; 1.7 mmol/l) when compared to those with normal birthweight. Males with low birthweight exhibited increased risk for low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (&lt;0.9 mmol/l) than those with normal birthweight. Females with low birthweight were at least 1.39, 1.40, 2.30 and 1.47 times more likely to have angina, coronary artery disease, stroke and overall cardiovascular diseases respectively, compared to those &#8805; 2.5 kg. Similarly, males with low birthweight were 1.76, 1.48, 3.34 and 1.70 times more likely to have angina, coronary artery disease, stroke and overall cardiovascular diseases compared to those &#8805; 2.5 kg, respectively. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was strongly and positively associated with birthweight, with a predicted increase of 2.6 ml/min (CI 2.1, 3.2) and 3.8 (3.0, 4.5) for each kg of birthweight for females and males, respectively. The odd ratio (95% confidence interval) for low glomerular filtration rate (&lt;61.0 ml/min for female and &lt; 87.4 male) in people of low birthweight compared with those of normal birthweight was 2.04 (1.45, 2.88) for female and 3.4 (2.11, 5.36) for male. One hundred and eighty-nineCKD patients reported their birthweight; 106 were male. Their age was 60.3(15) years. Their birthweight was 3.27 (0.62) kg, vs 3.46 (0.6) kg for their AusDiab controls, p&lt;0.001 and the proportions with birthweight&lt;2.5 kg were 12.17% and 4.44%, p&lt;0.001. Among CKD patients, 22.8%, 21.7%, 18% and 37.6% were in CKD stages 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Birthweights by CKD stage and their AusDiab controls were as follows: 3.38 (0.52) vs 3.49 (0.52), p=0.251 for CKD2; 3.28 (0.54) vs 3.44 (0.54), p=0.121 for CKD3; 3.19 (0.72) vs 3.43 (0.56), p= 0.112 for CKD4 and 3.09 (0.65) vs 3.47 (0.67), p&lt;0.001 for CKD5. The results demonstrate that in an affluent Western country with a good adult health profile, low birthweight people were predisposed to higher rates of glycaemic dysregulation, high blood pressure, dyslipidaemia, cardiovascular diseases and lower glomerular filtration rate in adult life. In all instances it would be prudent to adopt policies of intensified whole of life surveillance of lower birthweight people, anticipating this risk. The general public awareness of the effect of low birthweight on development of chronic diseases in later life is of vital importance. The general public, in addition to the awareness of people in medical practice of the role of low birthweight, will lead to a better management of this group of our population that is increasingly surviving into adulthood.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">birth weight</field><field name="subject">birthweight</field><field

name="creator">Nerina Scarinci</field><field name="description">Hearing impairment is the most common communication disability in older people. The wide-ranging impact of hearing impairment on communication means that not only does the person with hearing impairment experience the consequences but also his or her frequent communication partners. This thesis investigates the impact of hearing impairment on spouses and uses the World Health Organization&#8217;s term &#8220;third-party disability.&#8221; Third-party disability is defined as the impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions experienced by the family due to the health condition of their significant other, and was identified by the World Health Organization as an area for future development and application of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Despite a number of studies previously published on the effect of hearing impairment on family members, including younger couples and carers, there remain substantial gaps in knowledge and understanding of the difficulties specifically relating to older people and factors associated with third-party hearing disability. This thesis focuses on the third-party disability experienced by normally hearing spouses (termed the &#8220;spouses&#8221; in this thesis) of older people with hearing impairment (termed the &#8220;partners&#8221; in this thesis). To add empirical data to the body of research, this series of studies first explored the lived experience of spouses of older people with hearing impairment in a qualitative study, then identified the ICF domains and categories that described third-party hearing disability, described the extent of third-party hearing disability in this population, modelled the contribution of factors to third-party hearing disability, and developed and psychometrically tested a scale to measure the third-party disability of spouses of older people with hearing impairment. Studies conducted within this thesis were therefore completed in two phases. Ten spouses of older people with hearing impairment participated in the first qualitative phase, consisting of semi-structured in-depth interviews. Results of this study showed that spouses experience a number of effects as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment including: (1) the broad ranging effects of the hearing impairment on the spouses&#8217; everyday lives; (2) the spouses&#8217; need to constantly adapt to their partners&#8217; hearing impairment; (3) the effect of acceptance of the hearing impairment on the spouse; and (4) the impact of ageing and retirement. Findings were then linked to the ICF to identify the most typical and relevant domains and categories of the ICF for spouses of older people with hearing impairment. The majority of themes were able to be linked to the ICF, with most linking to codes in the activities and participation component. A number of contextual factors were also identified that influenced the spouses&#8217; third-party disability. In the second phase, a further 100 older couples affected by hearing impairment participated in a quantitative face-to-face survey to describe the nature and degree of third-party disability in spouses, and to examine factors associated with third-party hearing disability. Concepts identified in the first qualitative study were used to formulate a 36-item tool for measuring spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability, namely the Significant Other Scale for Hearing Disability (SOS-HEAR). The majority of spouses in this study (98%) reported some degree of third-party hearing disability on at least one item of the SOS-HEAR. Communication difficulties between the couple were the central source of stress reported by spouses, followed by emotional problems in the spouse. Three factors were found to be significantly associated with greater third-party hearing disability: (1) lower relationship satisfaction as described by spouses; (2) a larger spouse-partner age difference; and (3) greater hearing disability in the hearing impaired partner as perceived by the spouse. The scaling properties of the SOS-HEAR were then examined, with a revised 27-item questionnaire found to be a reliable means of measuring older spouses&#8217; third-party hearing disability. Use of the SOS-HEAR is proposed as a means of identifying spouses of older people with hearing impairment in need of intervention. If spouses are identified as experiencing third-party hearing disability, health professionals are then in a position to facilitate discussions with the couple about the impact of the hearing loss on their daily functioning. The inclusion of spouses in rehabilitation takes into account the needs of both members of the couple such that they become partners in rehabilitation. In summary, this research has shown that hearing impairment in older people has an effect on the spouse, as they too experience situations of communication activity limitations and participation restrictions. It is clear that the lives of participants in this study were considerably affected as a result of their partners&#8217; hearing impairment, with spouses reporting a wide variety of stresses involving lifestyle changes, communication difficulties, and emotional consequences. This series of studies has highlighted the potentially important role of family-centred intervention in rehabilitation for older adults with hearing impairment, and strongly suggests the need for increased inclusion of spouses and significant others in the rehabilitation process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">third-party disability</field><field name="subject">hearing impairment</field><field name="subject">ICF</field><field name="subject">older people</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">spouses</field><field name="subject">significant others</field><field name="subject">communication</field><field name="subject">psychosocial factors</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hemispheric contributions to language: A divided visual field investigation of semantic processing following unilateral lesions</field><field name="creator">Erin Smith</field><field name="description">The left hemisphere (LH) is accepted as the dominant hemisphere for language processing. There is also evidence confirming the language processing abilities of the right hemisphere (RH), particularly its lexical-semantic processing potential (Chiarello, 1988; Joanette, Goulet, &amp; Hannequin, 1990). The capacity of the RH for language processing is significant to the investigation of language processing following LH lesions. However, the precise neurocognitive mechanisms underlying language processing following lesion remain to be fully elucidated. Subsequently, the overall aim for this thesis is to investigate hemispheric contributions to semantic processing following unilateral lesions, and to explore the significance of the contribution made by the RH. In order to achieve this overall aim, the current thesis firstly explores the hemispheric contributions made to lexical-semantic processing for healthy adults, and then shifts focus to explore the changes in hemispheric processing for participants with unilateral lesions (LH and RH). Comparisons of hemispheric activation between these groups will clarify the underlying hemispheric mechanisms that facilitate language processing following unilateral lesion. This thesis includes four complementary investigations of hemispheric contributions to semantic processing. The first study combined divided visual field (DVF) priming with event-related potentials (ERPs), in order to investigate controlled hemispheric semantic priming for young healthy adults. Two experiments were employed for a between subjects comparison of time-course differences (stimulus onset asynchrony, or SOA, varied between experiments) in hemispheric activation of associated and nonassociated category members. Continuous electroencephalograms were recorded throughout the priming task for each participant, and later analysed with reference to relevant ERP components (N400 and Late Positive Complex). Bilateral N400 priming was revealed for associated category members at both the short and long SOA. There was no significant N400 priming for the nonassociated category member condition. The examination of hemispheric priming of associated and nonassociated category member stimuli over the same time-course was continued in the second study for participants with unilateral LH lesions and matched controls. The second investigation aimed to determine the impact of unilateral LH lesions on controlled hemispheric semantic priming, utilising the DVF priming paradigm with participants following unilateral lesions. This study also aimed to explore associations between hemispheric activation during the online priming task and offline comprehension abilities. Differences in priming were observed between the LH lesion group and the control group, with participants in the LH lesion group requiring the association relationship to elicit priming. Priming also varied for participants as a function of their offline comprehension abilities, with RH priming associated with higher offline scores. The third investigation continued the exploration of hemispheric semantic activation following LH lesion, examining the impact of a LH lesion on interhemispheric control mechanisms, and the modification of hemispheric processing capacities with and without dominant hemisphere control. This investigation again utilised DVF priming with associated and nonassociated category member stimuli, in conjunction with the dual task paradigm. The dual task paradigm is designed to overload one hemisphere&#8217;s processing resources in order to remove interhemispheric suppression. Findings indicate that following LH lesions, the RH&#8217;s contribution is enhanced under conditions that are designed to overload the LH. The final study shifts from the investigation of participants with LH lesions to the impact of a RH lesion. This exploration of controlled hemispheric semantic priming following RH lesion sought to increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms for semantic processing following unilateral lesion. The RH&#8217;s role in lexical-semantic processing has been documented consistently over approximately the last twenty years, however, there remains limited direct investigation of a RH lesion&#8217;s impact on contributions to semantic processing. A single case investigation utilised the same experimental procedure as the second study described. Findings suggest a similar activation pattern between the individual with RH lesion and the control participants, with both exhibiting bilateral activation of the associated and nonassociated category member stimuli. However, a subtle difference was found between the activation of the individual with RH lesion and that of the control group, with the individual with a RH lesion showing increased strategic processing difficulties at the longer SOA. Overall, the current thesis demonstrates the importance of the RH for efficient strategic semantic processing for both healthy adults, and people with unilateral lesions. In addition, this thesis concludes that following a LH lesion, the RH contribution to controlled semantic processing may be associated with successful comprehension, and that RH contributions may be improved with the addition of a secondary task designed to overload LH processing. The present thesis provides evidence to support the use of the DVF priming paradigm in the investigation of hemispheric contributions to semantic processing following unilateral lesion. It is anticipated that these findings will improve the current understanding of the underlying hemispheric contributions to lexical-semantics following a unilateral lesion, and will encourage continuing investigation into the RH&#8217;s capacity to impact language recovery.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hemispheric Contributions</field><field name="subject">Semantics</field><field name="subject">Semantic Priming</field><field name="subject">Association</field><field name="subject">Category Membership</field><field name="subject">Controlled Processing</field><field name="subject">Left Hemisphere Lesion</field><field name="subject">Right Hemisphere Lesion</field><field name="subject">Divided Visual Field</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of SerpinB2 in tumour cells</field><field name="creator">Lee Major</field><field name="description">SerpinB2 (aka plasminogen activator type 2) is well described as an extracellular inhibitor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). However, the majority of SerpinB2 is retained intracellularly, and many uPA-independent activities have been reported for SerpinB2 suggesting an alternate function. This thesis explores the role of SerpinB2 in epithelial tumour cell lines, highlights the problems associated with various expression systems and argues that SerpinB2 has no role in growth or apoptosis of tumour cells. A potential role for immune modulation and angiogenesis is suggested in in vivo models. Previous research using SerpinB2 transfected, clonally selected tumour cell lines suggested that SerpinB2 regulates the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor protein (Rb) by binding and protecting Rb from degradation. Despite the use of two techniques under numerous conditions and positive controls, no significant interaction between SerpinB2 and Rb was found. SerpinB2 was reported to bind Rb through a PENF homology motif located within the SerpinB2 C-D interhelical loop region. The PENF homology motif was postulated to represent the motif responsible for binding to the C-pocket of Rb. Epstein Barr Virus nuclear antigen 6 (EBNA6) is a known Rb binding protein, which contains two predicted PENF homology motifs. However, mutation of the two PENF homology motifs within EBNA6 did not reduce Rb binding. Furthermore, the SerpinB2 PENF homology motif is actually not well conserved between SerpinB2 proteins from multiple species, whereas other regions of the SerpinB2 C-D loop show a high level of conservation. These data do not support a role for SerpinB2 and the PENF homology motif in Rb binding. SerpinB2 has been proposed to have a role in regulating growth and apoptosis. To further investigate this proposed phenotype of SerpinB2, SerpinB2 was expressed in a range of epithelial tumour lines using transient transfection. No change in growth, apoptosis or Rb levels were found. After &#8776;2-3 month antibiotic selection for the SerpinB2-expressing plasmid, SerpinB2 protein was lost without the loss of the transgene, indicating selective pressure against long-term SerpinB2 protein expression. To further investigate long-term SerpinB2 expression adenovirus and lentivirus vectors were used. Infection of tumour cell lines with adenovirus vectors expressing SerpinB2 resulted in reduced cell growth, characterised by increased p53 (but not Rb) levels and G2 arrest or apoptosis. When SerpinB2 expressing lentivirus vectors were used to transduce the same tumour cell lines, high levels of long-term expression of functional SerpinB2 was achieved. However, SerpinB2-expressing cell lines showed no differences in growth, proliferation, Rb levels, or apoptosis induced by a range of agents. Growth and apoptosis observed with adenovirus SerpinB2 had all the characteristics of adenovirus-associated toxicity, which has been reported previously for specific proteins. These experiments highlighted the problems associated with SerpinB2 expression systems and suggest that SerpinB2 expression per se is not toxic nor has a role in regulating Rb, growth and apoptosis. Screening of a number of tumour cell lines identified the HPV16 transformed cervical cancer line as expressing high levels of SerpinB2. SerpinB2 was located both extracellularly and intracellularly with a cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. A high molecular weight SerpinB2 species was identified in CaSki cells and was shown to be the N-linked glycosylated species. Sequencing showed the protein to be Type A SerpinB2 and the protein was shown to form an inhibitory complex with uPA. An abundant low molecular weight SerpinB2 species was also identified in CaSki cell supernatants and appeared to be a proteolytic fragment of SerpinB2. Treatment of CaSki with PMA, TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; increased SerpinB2 levels. Lentiviral based shRNA failed to significantly down regulate SerpinB2 expression and increasing SerpinB2 levels with lentiviral expression did not change growth, apoptosis, Rb levels or E7 transcription. Lentiviral expression of SerpinB2 in (normally SerpinB2 negative) HPV16 transformed SiHa cells, also failed to show changes in Rb levels or E7 transcription. CaSki thus express wild-type and functional SerpinB2, but no evidence could found that SerpinB2 effects HPV16 E7 transcription or Rb levels. The data presented identifies CaSki as valuable source of biologically functional SerpinB2. SerpinB2 expression in breast cancer cells has been associated with positive prognosis. Tubo, a SerpinB2-negative murine breast carcinoma cell line, was transduced with lentivirus expressing SerpinB2 and grown subcutaneously in BALB/c mice. SerpinB2 expressing tumours appeared red and were larger than control tumours. Furthermore, SerpinB2 expressing tumours had a &#8776;2 fold higher density of blood vessels when compared to Tubo and Tubo expressing EGFP. Mice carrying tumours expressing SerpinB2 also showed reduced anti-tumour IgG2 responses. These data suggest that a role for SerpinB2 in regulating angiogenesis and antitumour immunity. In conclusion, this thesis challenges the notion that SerpinB2 regulates Rb, cell cycle, and apoptosis and suggests a potential role for SerpinB2 in tumour angiogenesis and immunity.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">serpinb2</field><field name="subject">retinoblastoma protein</field><field name="subject">lentivirus</field><field name="subject">adenovirus</field><field name="subject">Human papilloma virus</field><field name="subject">th1</field><field name="subject">angiogenesis</field><field name="subject">caski</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of Treadmill Walking at High Intensity During Rehabilitation Following Stroke</field><field name="creator">Suzanne Kuys</field><field name="description">The majority of people with stroke regard walking in their community as very important (Lord et al 2004). Walking in the community is limited by slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity (Lord et al 2004; Patterson et al 2007). Slow walking speeds and poor walking capacity are identified sequela in people with stroke (Hill et al 1997). By the end of rehabilitation approximately 80% of people with stroke achieve independent walking (Dean &amp; Mackay 1992; Hill et al 1997). However, less than 10 percent are able to easily walk in their community (Hill et al 1997). Optimal motor learning requires task-specific practice (Carr &amp; Shepherd 2003). Treadmills offer the opportunity for repetitive practice of complete gait cycles (Shepherd &amp; Carr 1999), potentially providing greater intensity and longer duration walking practice than usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Recently there has been some suggestion that high-intensity interventions may improve walking in people with stroke (Moseley et al 2005). Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in people with stroke have been shown to impact on walking, in particular walking capacity (Kelly et al 2003). Treadmills, commonly used to retrain cardiorespiratory fitness in the healthy population, have been used to implement high-intensity interventions, improving cardiorespiratory fitness in people with chronic stroke (Macko et al 2005). Therefore it is possible that exercise aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness may improve walking in people with stroke. The aim of these four studies was to investigate in those following stroke if walking on a treadmill at high-intensity during inpatient rehabilitation could improve walking capacity without compromising pattern and quality. The first study determined, in an Australian setting, the duration and intensity of usual physiotherapy rehabilitation. Study 2 compared walking pattern immediately following overground and treadmill walking practice at the same intensity. Study 3 examined the effect of treadmill walking at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness on walking pattern and quality. The final study, investigated the feasibility of implementing a high-intensity treadmill intervention in addition to usual physiotherapy rehabilitation in people following stroke able to walk undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. Intensity in all studies was calculated using heart rate reserve or the Karvonen method. Heart rate is a valid, accurate and stable indicator of exercise intensity due to its relatively linear relationship with oxygen consumption (ACSM 2006). For those people taking beta-blocker medication, the heart rate-lowering effect of this type of medication was accommodated. A target intensity of 40% heart rate reserve was used; as this is the minimum required improve cardiorespiratory fitness (ACSM 2006). Walking pattern and quality were measured in Studies 2-4. Walking pattern was measured by linear kinematics using GAITRite (CIR Systems, Clifton, NJ, USA) and angular kinematics using a 2-dimensional webcam application. Walking quality was determined by observation of the webcam footage and scored using the Rivermead Visual Gait Assessment, Wisconsin Gait Scale and a vertical visual analogue scale by blinded assessor. The first study found that people with stroke spent an average of 21 (SD 11) minutes participating in standing and walking activities that are associated with reaching the target intensity during physiotherapy rehabilitation. Those who could walk spent longer in these activities (25 minutes, SD 12) compared to those would couldn&#8217;t walk (17 minutes, SD 9). However, the intensity of these activities was low; walkers reached a maximum of 30% heart rate reserve and non-walkers reached 35% heart rate reserve. Using the treadmill as a mode of task-specific physiotherapy rehabilitation, the second study in this thesis found that walking pattern was similar following 10 minutes of treadmill and overground walking practice at the same intensity. The third study found that during walking on the treadmill at intensities high enough to influence cardiorespiratory fitness (up to 60% heart rate reserve), many of the linear and angular kinematic parameters moved closer to a more normal pattern and walking quality was not compromised. The final study in this thesis, a randomised controlled trial, found that a 6-week high-intensity treadmill walking intervention was feasible in people with stroke able to walk who were undergoing rehabilitation. Participants attended 89% of the treadmill sessions, reaching an average duration of more than 20 minutes and an intensity of 40% heart rate reserve after two weeks. The intervention also appeared effective with significant improvements in walking speed and capacity following the treadmill walking intervention. Improvements in walking speed were maintained at 3 months. In summary, these studies found that usual physiotherapy in people with stroke was of low intensity. In addition, it was found that treadmill walking was safe and feasible as a means of increasing the intensity of physiotherapy rehabilitation, without compromising walking quality and pattern. Therefore, it may be possible to improve walking in people with stroke using high-intensity treadmill walking.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroke Rehabilitation,</field><field name="subject">Physiotherapy,</field><field name="subject">Gait,</field><field name="subject">Treadmill</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184759</field></doc><doc><field name="title">James V. Forrestal as Cold War Policymaker: A Re-Assessment</field><field name="creator">Belinda Lohrisch</field><field name="description">This thesis critically examines the career and significance of America&#8217;s first Secretary of Defence James V. Forrestal from a post-Cold War perspective. Within traditional Cold War scholarship, Forrestal&#8217;s legacy is problematic. The nature of his role as a defence administrator, combined with his suicide in 1949, has led scholars to underestimate his significance and relegate his legacy to the occasional biography. The few studies that examine his contribution utilise conventional analytical approaches that fail to fully assess his policymaking impact. The end of the Cold War, however, has brought additional insight into the policy concerns that dominated the conflict, new analytical approaches to its scholarship and fresh material on which to base a re-assessment. As this thesis demonstrates, the employment of new methodologies to study Forrestal&#8217;s impact is long overdue. By drawing on theories specifically related to leadership and decision-making behaviour, this thesis brings a deeper, fuller understanding of Forrestal&#8217;s policy-making impact as a Cold War official through an examination of his professional conduct. Despite Forrestal&#8217;s many successes, political controversies surrounding his defence career overshadowed his many achievements. This thesis argues that such controversies were the result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication as a public official, his policy-making and management styles, and the structure of his authority as defence secretary. They were not, as some have argued, the result of his ineffectiveness as a policy-maker, &#8220;hawkish&#8221; attitudes or declining mental health. His collapse, furthermore, was not the natural conclusion of any paranoid delusions or obsessive nature, but rather a result of Forrestal&#8217;s dedication to his work at the expense of his own health. This thesis undertakes a content analysis of Forrestal&#8217;s writings and an examination of his policy-making approach, concentrating on the evolution and execution of his policy advice and initiatives, as well as the structure of his authority as secretary of defence. It begins with a biographical overview of his life and public service career, as well as an assessment of existing Cold War scholarship and its general tendency to underestimate Forrestal&#8217;s significance. The components of his legacy are then analysed thematically, with chapters devoted to his foreign policy influence, his role in the unification controversy and his administrative efforts as defence secretary. Throughout, Forrestal&#8217;s career and significance is reassessed both in the application of new theoretical and methodological insights, and the analysis of recently declassified and reorganised documents, particularly the complete and unexpurgated version of Forrestal&#8217;s official diaries.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">james forrestal, cold war, policy-making, defence policy, defence administration</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">GENETIC ANALYSIS OF IMPORTANT TRAITS FOR CONFECTIONERY SUNFLOWER IN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Yue Sun</field><field name="description">Sunflower is grown worldwide for oil production. In Australia, sunflower is under intense competition from canola as an oil crop. Confectionery sunflower aimed for the overseas snack food market is a potential opportunity for Australian farmers due to its ability to provide off-season supply to the major market located mainly in the northern hemisphere. To serve this aim, new confectionery sunflower hybrids adapted to Australian production system with drought tolerance, large achenes, high self-fertility and rust resistance are of paramount importance. The objectives of this project were to understand the genetic inheritance and genetic linkage relationships of the above traits and also to identify linked DNA markers with the potential for marker-assisted selection (MAS). The inheritance of achene-length was studied in a 12 x 12 diallel and a 14 x 12 North Carolina design II (NC II) mating design. Achene-length was evaluated under three environments for each mating design. Genetic correlation among all five achene-size related traits (achene-length, -width, - thickness and also kernel-length and -width) and 100-achene weight were moderate to high. Narrow-and broad-sense heritability for achene-length was moderate to high and similar for each design. The general combining ability (GCA) and maternal effects were found to be the main genetic factors controlling achene-length and each accounted for around 45% of the total genotypic variance. The inheritance of self-fertility (SF) was assessed with the same 12 x 12 diallel mating design evaluated in two environments. The 12 parents also displayed various levels of SF in addition to a wide range of achene-length. Negative genetic correlations between SF and all five achene-size related traits and 100-achene weight were observed. Modelling achene-length as a covariate revealed that certain pre-pollination floret characteristics represented by achene-length at maturity strongly affects SF in sunflower. When the effect of achene-length was removed statistically as a covariate, the specific combining ability (SCA) effect increased dramatically and became the major factor (other than pre-pollination floret characteristics) for SF determination and accounted for 65% of the total variance. Long achene genotypes tended to have low SF and a positive SCA effect was observed more frequently in F1 hybrids that involved small achene lines. The broad sense heritability was moderate (0.663 &#177; 0.017), while the estimate of narrow-sense heritability was nearly zero. A segregating F6:7 recombinant inbred line population with 239 progeny was developed from a cross between HaR4, a low delta (&#916;), high transpiration efficiency (TE), sunflower line with rust resistance but relatively low SF, and SA52 with all the characteristics in the opposite direction. The population was evaluated in two environments for three TE-related traits including &#916;, specific leaf weight (SLW) and chlorophyll content (CC) and four agronomic traits i.e. days to flowering (DTF), plant height (PlantH), SF and rust resistance (RustR). A linkage map 1074.6 cM in length with 138 SSR and 37 ISSR markers consisting of 19 linkage groups was constructed. Spatially adjusted BLUPs were used in QTL analysis for individual and combined environments. Altogether, 10 QTL were identified for &#916;, SLW and CC at individual environments, and 7 were detected by a combined analysis. Sixteen QTL were identified for 4 agronomic traits and 14 of them were confirmed by a combined analysis. Significant linkage among all three TE related traits was discovered on linkage group 4 (LG4), where alleles from one parent had the same direction of influence on TE which suggested either coupling phase linkage or pleiotropy. QTL for SF and RustR were closely linked on LG13. An F2 population with 502 progeny developed from a cross between Jumbo, a large achene confectionery sunflower line, and RIL25, an oilseed small achene line, was evaluated for five achene-size related traits in a single field trial. Using a subset of 178 progeny a framework genetic linkage map, 899.7 cM in length, containing 128 SSR markers and 23 ISSR markers was constructed with 18 linkage groups. Based on the results of a simulated QTL analysis, a modified selective genotyping strategy was employed for QTL analysis with 178 F2 individuals (128 randomly selected, 25 shortest achene F2&#8217;s and 25 longest achene F2&#8217;s). Altogether 18 achene-size related QTL with small effects were identified. Achene-size related genes characteristically expressed additive gene action although several alleles were partially recessive towards the large achene parent. The 18 identified achene-size related QTL were validated in the same diallel mating experiment mentioned above. Significant marker-trait associations were detected for 15 QTL. In addition to 12 significant alleles detected from the F2 population, 12 additional alleles associated with achene-size traits were revealed after the analysis with the diallel. These markers are ready to be used in MAS for confectionery sunflower breeding. Great steps have been made in obtaining essential knowledge of inheritance and linkage of target traits for breeding confectionery sunflower adapted to Australian production environments. The identified markers can be used in MAS and further enhance the breeding process.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confectionery sunflower</field><field name="subject">quantitative trait loci</field><field name="subject">combining ability</field><field name="subject">carbon isotope discrimination</field><field name="subject">specific leaf weight</field><field name="subject">chlorophyll content</field><field name="subject">achene size</field><field name="subject">kernel size</field><field name="subject">self-fertility</field><field name="subject">rust resistance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186136</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Approaches to the Development of Koala Sperm Cryopreservation Techniques</field><field name="creator">Yeng Zee</field><field name="description">The primary objective of the studies described in this thesis was to improve the cryopreservation success of koala spermatozoa for the purpose of establishing a genome resource bank for this species. A defining feature of the studies in this thesis was the implementation of an organelle-specific approach to better understand the causes of koala sperm cryo-injury. The functional attributes of spermatozoa, such as mitochondrial function, plasma membrane fluidity, membrane lipid asymmetry and DNA integrity were assessed as an indication of cryo-injury. Sperm mitochondrial function and plasma membrane integrity were examined by cryomicroscopy using the fluorescent probes JC-1 and propidium iodide (PI) respectively in a dual staining technique. Cooling and re-warming koala spermatozoa were more detrimental to mitochondrial function than to plasma membrane integrity. Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was suppressed by freezing and thawing treatments; after thawing, MMP declined significantly during rewarming (from 5&#186;C to 35&#186;C). The distribution of GM1 ganglioside was examined using fluorescent-labelled cholera toxin B. No significant redistribution of GM1 was observed after chilling or cryotreatment. The externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) was examined using fluorescent-labelled annexin V. There was no significant increase in translocation of PS after chilling or cryopreservation. These observations imply that cryotreatment had little effect on plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Koala spermatozoa were incubated in a range of anisotonic media to investigate whether nuclear swelling was caused by osmotic flux during the cryopreservation process. Although the most hypotonic solution tested (64 mOsm/kg) induced the highest incidence of nuclear relaxation (mean &#177; SEM; 12 &#177; 3%), this was not as severe as that previously documented following cryopreservation. Chromatin relaxation is a phenomenon observed in koala spermatozoa, where the sperm nucleus expands due to the result of structural changes in the natural conformation of the sperm DNA/protamine complex. DNA fragmentation was not a primary cause of cryopreservation-induced sperm chromatin relaxation, although in situ nick translation of putative DNA breaks indicated that these increased as the sperm head became progressively more relaxed. Using a Sperm Chromatin Dispersion test (SCDt) specifically developed and validated for koala spermatozoa, a continuum of nuclear morphotypes was observed, ranging from no apparent DNA fragmentation to spermatozoa with highly dispersed and degraded chromatin. A double comet assay was also developed to investigate DNA fragmentation in the koala spermatozoa. Conducted under neutral followed by alkaline conditions, this assay was able to differentiate between single- (SSB) and double-stranded (DSB) DNA damage in an effort to refine the interpretation of DNA damage in mature koala spermatozoa; the majority of the koala spermatozoa had nuclei with DNA abasic-like residues. The ubiquity of these residues suggested that constitutive alkali-labile sites are part of the structural configuration of the koala sperm nucleus. Spermatozoa with &#8220;true&#8221; DNA fragmentation exhibited a continuum of comet morphologies, ranging from a more severe form of alkaline-susceptible DNA, to nuclei that exhibited both SSB and DSB. Swelling of koala sperm chromatin following cryopreservation has largely been attributed to the absence of inter-molecular disulphide cross-linkages in the marsupial sperm nucleus. Fish spermatozoa also lack disulphide bonds within their chromatin, but nevertheless, have been successfully cryopreserved. To examine the hypothesis that the cryoprotectants used for fish sperm cryopreservation will confer a similar degree of protection on koala spermatozoa, various concentrations of five cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulphoxide, methanol, propylene glycol, ethylene glycol and dimethylacetamide) were evaluated. Each treatment was compared against an established koala sperm cryopreservation protocol that uses 14% glycerol. Dimethylacetamide at a concentration of 12.5% (v/v) was found to be comparable to glycerol in the successful cryopreservation of koala spermatozoa although high inter-male variability was observed. However, when the new protocol was subsequently validated for a larger population of captive koalas (n = 22), glycerol emerged the better cryoprotectant with respect to all sperm viability parameters assessed except for that of the incidence of chromatin relaxation, which was not affected by the cryoprotectant. Significant difference was also observed in the post-thaw survival of spermatozoa from different animals, which was independent of pre-freeze semen quality. Based on post-thaw semen viability parameters, the koalas could be divided into two distinct groups, where one group had significantly higher sperm viability compared to the other group, regardless of cryoprotectant used. Positive correlation between motility and MMP was observed before and after cryopreservation. However, cryopreservation significantly reduced the dependency between these variables (P &lt; 0.001), suggesting that cryopreservation reduced the dependency between mitochondrial function and motility.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">marsupial, spermatozoa, cryopreservation, mitochondrial function, cryodamage, DNA fragmentation, chromatin relaxation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Life and Times of Alex Doucas: Migrant and Author: Searching for a new identity</field><field name="creator">Abraham Sophocleous</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis offers the first detailed critical account of the Greek-Australian writer, Alex Doucas (1900-1962) who came to Australia in 1927 as a migrant from Asia Minor. It attempts to place his work in the perspectives of Greek and Australian literatures and to evaluate his position both as a migrant and as a writer. The Asia Minor Catastrophe and the exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey in 1923, as well as the Great Depression he faced in Australia along with many other Australians had a profound effect on his social outlook. Considered one of the pioneers of Greek-Australian Literature, Doucas played an important role in the development of Greek community life in Australia during the pre- and post-World War II periods. His work consists of two published novels (one posthumously) and a significant body of published and unpublished, stories, poems, translations and essays. Out of print for some decades, it remains largely unknown to the general public or even to academic circles in Greece and in Australia. It was, however, a landmark of Greek-Australian Literature and continues to have more than historical interest in its treatment of migration, exile and displacement, and in its use of intercultural perspectives to forge a positive vision for humanity. Although forced into ill-paid manual labour for much of his life after his arrival in Australia, Alex Doucas tried to develop links and relationships with Australian intellectual circles and to become involved in Australian life in the broadest way. At the same time, he never lost contact with social, political and literary developments in Greece. Alex Doucas maintained close relations with both the Greek and Australian literary traditions. As a writer he belongs to the Greek generation of the 1930s and its literary traditions. In his work, he dealt with events which took place in Anatolia before the Asia Minor Catastrophe as well as with the impact the catastrophe had on Greek society. He is one of the first writers of his generation who turned his attention to the &#8220;other side of the coin&#8221; and investigated the impact of the Catastrophe on the Turkish people. This perspective was adopted mainly due to the openness that he found in Australia, an openness that led to Multiculturalism. Alex Doucas was a multiculturalist before his time. His work is a fine example of the Australian version of Multiculturalism. Through his brother Stratis Doucas (also a writer) and others, he kept himself informed on all sorts of changes and developments in his native country, Greece, especially as it was shaped after the Asia Minor Catastrophe. At the same time, he tried to understand the Australian way of life, its culture and its literary traditions. His bi-cultural position gave him a powerful perspective. He attempted to understand the Australian way of life through his Greekness and to find answers for problematic events that happened in Greece through his Australian experience. Across the entire span of Doucas&#8217;s work, it is clear that his political philosophy and his belief in the goals of socialism played a crucial role in his consciousness of himself as a writer whose role was to provide the artistic equivalent of the philosophical basis of Marxism, best expressed in the Theses on Feuerbach (1845) by Marx, in his famous dictum, "Philosophers have hitherto only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it". In other words, it was never enough for Doucas simply to describe in social realist terms the conditions of life and the aspirations of human beings. His aim was to show how these conditions might be changed for the better, not only for the individual, but for the community as a whole. Equally, he wished to show how people&#8217;s aspirations, particularly those of an immigrant community familiar with exile, suffering and loss, might be more fully realised.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multicultural literature, migrant literature, comparative literature, social realism, asia minor catastrophe, modern greek literature, australian literature, literary traditions</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">RIPARIAN GROUNDWATER FLOW AND SALT TRANSPORT IN AQUIFER-ESTUARY INTERACTION</field><field name="creator">Mothei Lenkopane</field><field name="description">Estuarine ecosystems are under enormous stress due to rapid coastal developments and climate change. Proper management of these important ecosystems requires a good understanding of their key processes. In this thesis, riparian groundwater-surface water interaction is explored for an aquifer-estuary system primarily by a series of numerical experiments. The work focuses on riparian-scale groundwater flow and salinization. The overall aim of the study was to extend our understanding of aquifer-estuary exchange, which is currently centered on the lower marine estuarine reach, to middle estuaries (i.e., the estuary reach that has variable salinity). The numerical experiments were guided by previous studies and observations made from an exploratory field investigation conducted in and next to Sandy Creek, a macro-tidal estuary incised in the alluvial aquifer of the Pioneer Valley, North-eastern Australia (Longitude 49.11&#176;, Latitude -21.27&#176;). The following observations were made from the field investigation: Sandy Creek estuary experiences a variable salinity regime in its mid reaches that consists of periods of 1) freshwater flushing due to up catchment-derived flooding, 2) persistent freshwater conditions for at least 2 months following the flooding, 3) tidal salinity fluctuations and 4) constant near-seawater salinity; laterally extensive and disconnected aquitards were found to occur at the field site; Sandy Creek had an essentially &#8216;vertical&#8217; bank slope. Numerical simulations were conducted using the finite element modeling code FEFLOW for saturated unsaturated, variable-density groundwater flow and solute transport, to examine the influence of the following factors on aquifer-estuary exchange: a tidally varying estuarine salinity and hydraulic head, a seasonal freshwater flush (i.e., estuary with freshwater and an elevated stage due to an up catchment sourced flood), near estuary aquitard layers, lateral asymmetry (about the estuary centerline) in hydraulic conductivity and regional hydraulic gradients. The simulations neglected seepage face development after numerical experiments showed that for a vertical bank estuary interacting with a sandy loam aquifer, seepage face effects on groundwater flow and associated salinity distribution were minimal. The following observations were drawn from the range of numerical experiments considered. Tidal salinity fluctuations in the estuary (varying between 0 and 1 - i.e., using a relative salinity scale where a salinity of 1 is seawater) produced flow paths and residence times that were distinctly different to the constant seawater salinity case. While the constant average 0.5 salinity case and the corresponding tidally-varying salinity case (i.e., salinity varying between 0 and 1) produced somewhat comparable results in terms of RUC and RLC (RUC represents groundwater discharge to the estuary that originated from recharge to the estuary bank and RLC groundwater discharge to the estuary that originated from recharge through the estuary bed), whereas flow paths and the total salt mass in the aquifer differed. Freshwater flushing simulations indicated that the near-estuary aquifer responds rapidly to a 2-day &#8216;wet season&#8217; flushing event with a short-lived freshwater lens created through freshening of the hyporheic zone. Annual cycling of the seasonal flushing led to significant disruption of the estuary water circulation in the aquifer thereby impacting on residence times, transport pathways, and RUC and RLC, and acting to potentially remobilize groundwater and contaminants previously trapped in continuous and semi-continuous re-circulation cells. Although groundwater flow paths determined using tide-averaged velocity vectors were representative of flow paths from transient tidally driven flow vector field, residence times calculated from the two flow fields were markedly different. The influence of riparian scale aquitards and lateral asymmetry (about the estuary centreline) in hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivity on groundwater flow and associated salinity distribution was also found to be sensitive to estuarine salinity conditions. The results indicate that observations made about aquifer-estuary interaction in the lower estuary may not be directly applicable to the middle estuary. According to the simulations, tidal salinity variations in the estuary are important factors that affect hyporheic-riparian salt transport processes and that the use of a time averaged estuarine salinity as an approximation to variable salinity conditions is unsuitable for the accurate prediction of the near-estuary dynamics in middle estuaries. This study was based on a two dimensional representation of the riparian scale interaction and it is clear that future research needs to focus on the three-dimensionality of the aquifer-estuary system, incorporating spatially and temporally varying flow and transport characteristics. That is, many estuaries are tortuous and the aquifer geology spatially complex such that assumptions required for the two-dimensional section will most likely restrict application to the field. The tidal dynamics in the middle estuary is also expected to generate three dimensional aspects to the aquifer-estuary interaction. Thus further investigation that explicitly models the hydrodynamics and salt transport in the estuary and estuarine morphology is required to refine the insight provided by the simple conceptual model adopted in this study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estuarine salinity, riparian zones, groundwater, numerical experiments, seawater intrusion, seepage face, aquitards, asymmetry.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193168</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buddhist Meditation Through the Medium of the Internet</field><field name="creator">Joanne Miller</field><field name="description">Since its inception, the Internet has served as a powerful medium for the dissemination of religious information and the creation of religious communities. Cyberspace now represents an important global paradigm shift in the way religion is conducted. This research provides a sociological account of the affordances the Internet contributes to religious life by examining the ways in which it has influenced the conduct or practices associated with Buddhism. In particular, it assesses the extent to which the rituals constitutive of the Buddhist practice of meditation have been achieved by the Cybersangha, the term Buddhists use for the online Buddhist community. The thesis argues that the Internet is not well suited to the facilitation of particular types of religious understanding and that there are clear limitations to its ability to provide the shared ritualistic experience necessitated by meditation. This is due to the fact that current technology can enable ritual only to a limited degree, and to the ways in which the textual nature of the Internet poses problems for religious experience of an intuitive, non-mediated nature. For these reasons, despite the fact that many websites advertise &#8216;online meditation&#8217; and despite the strong attempts of some communities to use the Internet as a meditational medium, online meditation cannot be fully facilitated by the Internet. Since a key method by which a Buddhist attains understanding of reality is the use of the body in a meditative act, the inability to provide for embodiment means that the Internet can never offer an experiential equivalent to that of an offline environment. The lack of this experiential aspect means that it cannot in turn provide for holistic, religious communion. As such, there needs to be a further philosophical and practical appraisal of the capabilities of the Internet in general, and as a medium by which a religious experience can be engendered.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">22 Philosophy and Religious Studies</field><field name="subject">Buddhist meditation online, internet, ritual, religion online, online religion, online ritual, community, cyberspace, religious experience, religious use of the body, authority, authenticity, religion and the internet, meditating in cyberspace, zen, buddh</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineered Surfaces for Biomaterials and Tissue Engineering</field><field name="creator">Peter George</field><field name="description">The interaction of materials with biological systems is of critical importance to a vast number of applications from medical implants, tissue engineering scaffolds, blood-contacting devices, cell-culture products, as well as many other products in industries as diverse as agriculture. This thesis describes a method for the modification of biomaterial surfaces and the generation of tissue engineering scaffolds that utilises the self assembly of poly (styrene)-block-poly (ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) block copolymers. Block copolymers consist of alternating segments of two or more chemically distinct polymers. The salient feature of these materials is their ability to self organise into a wide range of micro-phase separated structures generating patterned surfaces that have domain sizes in the order of 10-100nm. Further, it is also possible to specifically functionalise only one segment of the block copolymer, providing a means to precisely locate specific biological signals within the 10-100nm domains of a nano-patterned surface, formed via the programmed micro-phase separation of the block copolymer system. The density and spatial location of signalling molecules can be controlled by altering several variables, such as block length, block asymmetry, as well as processing parameters, providing the potential to authentically emulate the cellular micro to nano-environment and thus greatly improving on existing biomaterial and tissue engineering technologies. This thesis achieved several aims as outlined below; Developed methods to control the self-assembly of PS-PEO block copolymers and generate nano-patterned surfaces and scaffolds with utility for biomaterials applications. PS-PEO diblock copolymers were blended with polystyrene (PS) homopolymer and spin cast, resulting in the rapid self-assembly of vertically oriented PEO cylinders in a matrix of PS. Due to the kinetically constrained phase-separation of the system, increasing addition of homopolymer is shown to reduce the diameter of the PEO domains. This outcome provides a simple method that requires the adjustment of a single variable to tune the size of vertically oriented PEO domains between 10-100nm. Polymeric scaffolds for tissue engineering were manufactured via a method that combines macro-scale temperature induced phase separation with micro-phase separation of block copolymers. The phase behaviour of these polymer-solvent systems is described, and potential mechanisms leading to this spectacular structure formation are presented. The result is highly porous scaffolds with surfaces comprised of nano-scale self-assembled block copolymer domains, representing a significant advance in currently available technologies. Characterised the properties of these unique nano-structured materials as well as their interaction with proteinaceous fluids and cells. Nano-patterned PS-PEO self-assembled surfaces showed a significant reduction in protein adsorption compared to control PS surfaces. The adhesion of NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells was shown to be significantly affected by the surface coverage of PEO nano-domains formed by copolymer self-assembly. These nano-islands, when presented at high number density (almost 1000 domains per square micron), were shown to completely prevent cellular attachment, even though small amounts of protein were able to bind to the surface. In order to understand the mechanism by which these surfaces resisted protein and cellular adsorption we utilised neutron reflection to study their solvation and swelling properties. The results indicate that the PEO domains are highly solvated in water; however, the PEO chains do not extend into the solvent but remain in their isolated domains. The data supports growing evidence that the key mechanism by which PEO prevents protein adsorption is the blocking of protein adsorption sites. Control the nano-scale presentation of cellular adhesion and other biological molecules via the self-assembly of functionalised PS-PEO block copolymers Precise control over the nano-scale presentation of adhesion molecules and other biological factors represents a new frontier for biomaterials science. Recently, the control of integrin spacing and cellular shape has been shown to affect fundamental biological processes, including differentiation and apoptosis. We present the self-assembly of maleimide functionalised PS-PEO copolymers as a simple, yet highly precise method for controlling the position of cellular adhesion molecules. By controlling the phase separation of the functional PS-PEO block copolymer we alter the nano-scale (on PEO islands of 8-14 nm in size) presentation of the adhesion peptide, GRGDS, decreasing lateral spacing from 62 nm to 44 nm and increasing the number density from ~ 450 to ~ 900 islands per um2. The results indicate that the spreading of NIH-3T3 fibroblasts increases as the spacing between islands of RGD binding peptides decreases. Further, the same functional PS-PEO surfaces were utilised to immobilise poly-histidine tagged proteins and ECM fragments. The technologies developed in this thesis aim to improve on several weaknesses of existing biomaterials, in particular, directing cellular behaviour on surfaces, and within tissue engineering scaffolds, but also, on the prevention of fouling of biomaterials via non-specific protein adsorption. The application of block copolymer self-assembly for biomaterial and tissue engineering systems described in this thesis has great potential as a platform technology for the investigation of fundamental cell-surface and protein-surface interactions as well as for use in existing and emerging biomedical applications.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Block copolymer</field><field name="subject">polystyrene-block-poly (ethylene oxide)</field><field name="subject">self-assembly</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnolgy</field><field name="subject">Surface Modification</field><field name="subject">Protein Adsorption</field><field name="subject">cell spreading</field><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">integrin</field><field name="subject">RGD</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:194675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An ethnographic study of the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless in Brisbane</field><field name="creator">Cameron Parsell</field><field name="description">Abstract People who are homeless are portrayed to be a distinct type of &#8216;homeless person&#8217;. Within scholarly research literature, their state of homelessness has been presented as informative of who they are. On both an individual and collective level, people without homes are ascribed with identities on the basis of their homelessness. Their voices and perspectives rarely contribute to broader knowledge about who they are as people. As such, the imposed &#8216;homeless identity&#8217; has the consequence of positioning them as &#8216;other&#8217; than the &#8216;normal&#8217; people with homes. Using an ethnographic approach, this study aims to understand the day-to-day lives and identities of people who are homeless. Approximately one hundred people who slept and interacted within inner suburban Brisbane&#8217;s public places participated in this research. To learn about how they lived and who they saw themselves as individuals, I observed them, socialised with them, engaged them in informal conversations and formal interviews. This approach to fieldwork, conducted over a six month period, provided me with the opportunity to witness diverse aspects of daily lives. Further, the ethnographic engagement enabled a consideration of the ways people enacted and displayed different aspects of their identities across different social and physical places. For the individuals who participated in this study, there was a stark distinction between how they lived, on the one hand, and the type of people they identified themselves as, on the other. They were comfortable describing their lives in ways that deviated from what they saw as the &#8216;mainstream&#8217;, but at the same time, they aligned themselves with this &#8216;mainstream&#8217;. Research participants expressed a strong view that their experiences of homelessness did not offer any purchase in explaining who they were, and how they thought about the world. The public places in which they lived were perceived as problematic. Public places were dangerous and the site of unwanted interactions. Although living in public places meant that interactions and friendships with other people who were homeless was a reality, these interactions did not constitute a &#8216;homeless collective&#8217;. More fundamentally, however, living in public places meant having no legitimate places, and having limited capacity to control day-to-day lives. The participants in this research articulated stereotypical notions of what home meant to them &#8211; home was a physical structure, a house. Similarly, home was a solution to their lives as homeless. Their constructions of home can also be seen as symbolic of their aspirations to find their &#8216;place&#8217;, and engage in the &#8216;mainstream&#8217; society they feel disconnected from. While public places were associated with limited control over daily lives, the people in this research also exercised agency in enacting different aspects of their identities. Mediated by the social and physical constraints within their environment, they displayed an awareness of social expectations and emphasised elements of the self to achieve specific ends. Identities matter. An understanding of the identities of people experiencing homelessness, from their perspectives, can contribute toward the development of homelessness practice and policy responses. A distinction is made between solving problems people may have and solving homelessness. In terms of the latter, the thesis concludes that the provision of &#8216;normal&#8217; housing and the availability of support, as distinct from mandatory engagement with case management, is the most appropriate response to the needs of the people who participated in this research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">homelessness</field><field name="subject">homeless people</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">public places</field><field name="subject">home</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:204070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of learning support as revealed through the practice of six exemplary Support teachers (learning difficulties) based in Queensland state primary schools</field><field name="creator">Michael Boyle</field><field name="description">Support teachers learning difficulties (STLD) have made a significant contribution to the provision of support for students experiencing learning difficulties and learning disabilities in Queensland state primary schools over almost forty years. During the 1990s with the implementation of an inclusive curriculum in schools, and in recent years, with changing systemic expectations of how academic performance might be improved, these teachers have increasingly participated in collaborative models with their classroom colleagues to provide for students experiencing various barriers to learning. This study focuses on the nature of exemplary practice as perceived through the eyes and voices of six exemplary STLD teachers. In keeping with this intent, a process of selecting the participants for in-depth study was instigated in a professional community of state primary STLD teachers located in a Brisbane education district to determine at the grass-roots what an exemplary STLD teacher might &#8220;look like&#8221;, and which six teachers in that community might contribute to the community&#8223;s understanding of exemplary STLD teaching practice. These contributions are represented in six case studies, referred to as &#8220;portraits&#8221; and were co-constructed, that is through a dialogic process between the participant and me. Each portrait communicates an aspect of teaching practice and the experiential knowledge that underpins it. The term &#8220;exemplary&#8221; has been adopted consciously to denote &#8220;that serves as an example&#8221; (Harper, 2001) in contrast to the term &#8220;expert&#8221;, which frequently carries a technical connotation. A mixed methodology was adopted (Lincoln &amp; Guba, 2003) in this qualitative study in anticipation of the need to draw upon various methods that in combination might assist in viewing, conceptualizing and harnessing the dynamic complexity expected to be evident in grassroots practice. First, various expressions of constructivism contributed, with the major influence being social constructivism to denote a &#8220;house&#8221; or a community of professionals in ongoing dialogue. 6 This provides the framework within which the study has been undertaken. Second, phenomenology, most particularly the work of Moustakas (1994) and van Manen (1990, 1994, 1995, 2007), is the primary source for the inspiration (van Manen) and the methods and tools (Moustakas) to explore the nature of their practice. Phenomenological approaches were adopted with the expectation they could assist in highlighting the essence of each individual&#8223;s practice while allowing for the eliciting of experiential themes that are of importance to the professional community of STLD teachers. Finally, studies of practical teacher knowledge (Elbaz, 1983) in association with narrative inquiry (Connolly &amp; Clandinin, 1988) have provided further insights into how the collective expression of these teachers might be displayed. The primary preoccupation of the portraits is the teachers&#8223; provision of support for individual students, and the nature and quality of the relationships enlisted in the service of making this provision. The teachers&#8223; transactions on behalf of these students are indicative of a raft of values, ideals, collaborative and communication skills which might be subsumed by the term relatedness, and the ability to see astutely the elements in various situations that need attentiveness. Their practice in action appears to be best encapsulated by Van Manen&#8223;s (1995) term &#8220;pedagogical tact&#8221;, a term borrowed to capture the nature of the pedagogical relationships infused into their personal and professional selves. Three views of practice are provided to display and illuminate the nature of the six exemplary teachers&#8223; collective practice &#8211; View 1: &#8220;From the inside&#8221; which reveals the metaphors that inhabit their practice and the significance they have for their practice; View 2: &#8220;From the outside&#8221; which, through the vehicle of a narrative highlights a STLD teacher and a classroom teacher undertaking a collaborative process of providing for Dayne a student experiencing significant difficulties; View 3: &#8220;Thinking together&#8221; which provides an edited script elicited from a conversation of the participating exemplary STLD teachers. Collectively, the three views reveal what is at the heart of learning support for the six teachers. In addition, aspects of practical knowledge that are particularly pertinent to learning support practice are discussed. 7 Finally, the effectiveness of the methods adopted for the study is explored. First, the screening process successfully enabled the selection of participants who had developed their craft to a sophisticated degree enhanced by their own &#8220;personal signature&#8221; (Eisner, 1991). Second, the adoption of a combination of a social constructivist framework and phenomenological approaches provided appropriate vehicles to enable the construction of six portraits of practices that exemplified significant aspects of practice. Third, the difficulties of authenticating the portraits using a cohort of critical friends from the STLD community and forging links with the community are discussed. Finally, I raise the possibility of embedding the portraits in professional development contexts where early career STLD teachers may wish to reflect on their practice.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning support, exemplary, pedagogical relationships, practical knowledge, phenomenology, social constructivism</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205299</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing Context-Aware Applications for Complex Environments</field><field name="creator">Brett Campbell</field><field name="description">Researchers have approached the problem of designing context-aware systems, computer systems that can react intelligently to the context in which they are used, from both software engineering and human-centred perspectives. While engineered context-aware systems have found successful application in optimising technical settings without requiring mundane and explicit interaction from humans, challenges remain in furthering their application to more complex environments. In particular, when technical decisions and human actions are intertwined in sophisticated work environments (rather than, for example, the simple act of transferring a mobile phone call to receive a signal from the nearest tower), the problem of designing context-aware systems demands further examination and calls for a new approach. A natural extension of the software engineering approach in more challenging environments is to try to implement increasingly sophisticated algorithms for managing context in the hope that this will lead to autonomous application behaviour. In contrast, research from a human-centred perspective, grounded in the social sciences and philosophy, demonstrates that context is not entirely objective and measurable but rather is dynamic and created through human action. It may not be easily detected through technical sensing systems, and therefore simply employing more sophisticated algorithms within the technical sphere may not be effective. While engineering approaches have continued to evolve, the problem of how to design interfaces to context-aware applications still remains. The research reported in this dissertation investigated the problem of designing context-aware systems for the complex environment of a dental surgery. I undertook, though a participatory design approach (a) to better characterise the problem of designing context-aware systems, and (b) to understand how design methods could be employed to bridge the human and software engineering approaches. The gap in existing research on context-aware systems is evident in the way that the methods applied to designing systems don't provide an insight into how people actively create the context in which they work (in a practical rather than theoretical sense) they don&#8216;t closely examine the behaviours of people, the role and arrangement of artefacts, and the dynamic relationships between people and artefacts. I found that an understanding of how these features of work and human behaviour are realised in practice in a given environment is fundamental to being able to design an effective context-aware system for that environment. The challenge is to design at the boundary between the technical and the social. The contribution of this thesis is an approach that explores context-aware design through synthesis. The synthetic approach leads to design opportunities and guidelines based on an understanding of the processes through which people actively co-create the context in which they work. I have applied and built upon a number of existing user-centred design and participatory design methods, in addition to creating some new methods in order to develop an understanding of how designers can examine the human aspects surrounding the co-creation of context and apply these in a way that progressively informs the design process. The methods collectively represent a novel approach to designing context-aware applications and differ from the more traditional technical approaches of developing software frameworks and infrastructures, and formal models of context, tasks, users, and systems. The techniques presented have focused primarily on developing an understanding of how humans find meaning in their actions along with their interaction with other people and technology. Participatory design methods help participants to reveal potential implicit technical resources that can be presented explicitly in technologies in order to assist humans in managing their interactions with and amidst technical systems gracefully. The methods introduced and the design approach proposed complement existing research on context-awareness from both a human-centred and software engineering perspective. This research builds on the notion of providing resources which allow users to manage their own context and also manage shifts in control while interacting with other people and with a variety of technical artefacts. It does this by examining a complex work environment, in particular looking at the kinds of resources people use and expect to use (and the constraints around these), the form(s) it is appropriate for them to take, and the patterns of interaction they will ultimately be used within.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">context-aware computing</field><field name="subject">ubiquitous computing</field><field name="subject">human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">participatory design</field><field name="subject">user centred design</field><field name="subject">design methods</field><field name="subject">dental surgery technology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Immunological Investigation of Salivary Gland Antigens of the Australian Paralysis Tick Ixodes holocyclus for the Development of Toxin-Specific Immunoassays</field><field name="creator">Sonja Hall-Mendelin</field><field name="description">The Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus causes a potentially fatal paralysis in domestic animals, livestock and humans with companion animals (mainly dogs) most commonly affected. Current treatment regimes include administration of a commercial tick anti-serum (TAS), prepared as hyperimmune serum in dogs, to neutralise the effects of the toxin. However, each new batch must be standardised using an expensive and highly subjective bioassay performed in neonatal mice. There is currently an urgent need for a more cost effective and rapid in vitro assay that can be more objectively and accurately quantified. Further understanding of the composition of the toxin molecule is also required to develop toxin-specific reagents necessary for these assays. One of the main objectives of this study was to develop a suitable immunoassay to replace the existing mouse bioassay for assessing batches of tick anti-sera for use in tick paralysis therapy in dogs. Initially an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was established to detect and quantify antibody specific for I. holocyclus toxin in dog sera. Using a partially purified antigen extracted from I. holocyclus salivary glands, good discrimination was achieved between reactive (hyperimmune) and non-reactive (na&#239;ve) sera. The hyperimmune dog sera reacted very strongly with the antigen compared to negligible reactions of serum from dogs not exposed to I. holocyclus. The reactions of hyperimmune sera were also significantly weaker to a non-toxin antigen control extracted from the salivary glands of the non-toxic tick Rhipicephalus microplus, indicating the assay was detecting toxin-specific responses. Furthermore, each of the hyperimmune sera that reacted strongly and specifically with the I. holocyclus antigen in the ELISA also strongly neutralised toxin in the mouse bioassay. Together these findings support the suitability of this ELISA for assessing the potency of batches of commercial dog hyperimmune sera for use as therapy for tick paralysis in dogs. Sera from dogs that were experimentally infested with ticks and sera from patient dogs, presenting at veterinary clinics with signs of tick paralysis, were also screened for antibodies to I. holocyclus antigen using the ELISA. Twenty-eight out of 29 sera from animals with single or multiple exposures to ticks failed to recognise the I. holocyclus antigen indicating the ELISA is not suitable as a diagnostic test to detect toxin-specific antibodies in animals with limited exposure to I. holocyclus infestation. A panel of toxin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was produced as research tools to analyse and purify tick toxin components. Rats were successfully immunised against tick toxin using a combination of inoculation of partially purified salivary gland antigen and exposure to tick infestation. The latter approach preserved the native confirmation of the toxin using a natural route of immunisation and rats were chosen due to their high tolerance of multiple tick infestations over several days. While fusion of rat spleen cells with mouse myeloma cells has been reported several times in the literature, the resulting hybridomas are unstable with fastidious culture requirements. Optimisation of the culture conditions revealed that most rat-mouse hybridoma lines grew best in serum-free medium supplemented with 5% foetal bovine serum. Of 600 hybridomas produced, only 12 were shown to be specific for the Ixodes antigen, as determined by ELISA. A selection of these hybridomas representing various patterns of affinity and/or antigen specificity were further analysed for toxin-neutralising ability in a mouse bioassay. Notably, the most potent toxin-neutralising mAb in mice, showed a specific but relatively moderate reaction to Ixodes antigen in the ELISA. The most potent toxin-neutralising mAbs inactivated toxin as strongly as the commercial TAS used for immunotherapy in dogs with tick paralysis. This suggests that mAbs may present an alternative source of immunotherapy, providing a potentially endless supply of a highly consistent reagent and negating the need to use live animals for both the production of tick antiserum and the continual testing of reagent batches. The toxin-neutralising mAbs were also used to analyse I. holocyclus toxin in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot to identify specific toxin proteins. The most potent neutralising mAbs consistently recognised high MW proteins (100-200 kDa) in a smeared pattern. Although this was contrary to previous reports of low molecular weight components (3-5 kDa) in holocyclotoxin, this study was the first to use mAbs prepared to native toxin. The large molecular weight structures likely represent presucursors to, or complexes of the smaller peptides, previously identified. When the Toxin-neutralising mAbs were assessed as ligands to affinity purify toxin components from crude Ixodes SG extracts, toxin components of 110 and 32 kDa were consistently identified. These purified proteins represent good candidates for N-terminal sequencing to further identify the toxin components in I.holocyclus salivary glands.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">03 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="subject">Ixodes holocyclus, tick salivary gland antigen, toxin, ELISA, monoclonal antibody, toxin-neutralisation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205787</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the potential of mesenchymal stromal cells to attenuate graft-versus-host disease</field><field name="creator">Melinda Elise Christensen</field><field name="description">Survival of patients with poor prognosis or relapsed haematopoietic malignancies can be markedly improved by allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). HSCT reconstitutes the immune and haematopoietic systems after myeloablative conditioning and inhibits the recurrence of the malignancy by a graft-versus-leukaemia (GVL) response mediated by donor T cells. However, significant post-transplant complications such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) continue to plague the event-free survival of this curative procedure. GVHD is facilitated by donor T cells that recognise histocompatibility antigens on host antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells (DC). Current treatment options for GVHD are focused on these T cells. However, these treatments result in an increased incidence of infection, graft rejection and relapse. A novel means of immunosuppression in GVHD is the use of multi-potent, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). MSC are non-immunogenic cells that actively suppress T cell function in vitro, and can resolve steroid-refractory GVHD in the clinic. Despite their use in the clinic, there is a paucity of pre-clinical data. Our aim was to investigate the in vivo efficacy of MSC to control GVHD while maintaining the beneficial GVL effect, and to begin to understand the mechanism by which MSC exert their immunosuppressive effects. We isolated and characterised MSC from murine bone/bone marrow and demonstrated that they suppressed T cell proliferation in vitro, even at low ratios of 1 MSC per 100 T cells. This was true of both donor-derived MSC, and MSC derived from unrelated donors (third party). Importantly, we observed that MSC significantly reduced T cell production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945; and IFN&#947; in culture supernatants and that IFN&#947; plays a key role in the ability of MSC to suppress T cell proliferation. In vivo, we examined the effects of donor-derived MSC on GVHD severity and onset in two myeloablative murine models of HSCT. A major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used as a proof&#8211;of-principle model [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB/c (H-2d)], and an MHC-matched, minor histocompatibility antigen (miHA) mismatched donor-recipient pair combination was used to mimic MHC-matched sibling transplantation [UBI-GFP/BL6 (H-2b)&#224;BALB.B (H-2b)]. We examined a number of variables related to MSC infusion including timing, dose and route of injection. We found that early post transplant infusion of MSC by the intraperitoneal injection was most effective at delaying death from GVHD, compared to pre-transplant infusion or intravenous injection. Furthermore, we found that the dose of MSC was critical, as infusion of too few MSC was ineffective and infusion of too many MSC exacerbated the development of GVHD. Taken together, these results suggest that timing, dose and route of injection are all important factors to be considered to ensure successful therapeutic outcome. To investigate the in vivo mechanism of action, we conducted timed sacrifice experiments in the MHC-mismatched model to determine if MSC altered cytokine secretion and cellular effectors, such as DC, known to play a key role in GVHD. Despite the fact that MSC given post-HSCT enter an environment full of activated DC and IFN&#947; levels, by day 3 and 6 post infusion, these activated DC and IFN&#947; levels are decreased compared to controls or mice infused with MSC pre-transplant (p&lt;0.05). This confirmed our in vitro data that IFN&#947; played an important role in MSC-mediated immunosuppression. In addition, when we removed a major source of IFN&#947; production in vivo by administering the T cell depleting antibody KT3 to mice with or without MSC, we found that although T cell depletion prolonged survival, MSC were unable to further enhance this effect. This was also true when MSC were used in combination with the conventional immunosuppressant cyclosporine. Finally, we examined whether the infusion of MSC would compromise the GVL effect. We found that whilst MSC could delay the onset of GVHD, in our model they did not alter the anti-tumour effects of the donor T cells. Overall, we have shown that MSC can delay but not prevent death from GVHD when administered at an appropriate time and dose and that IFN&#947; is required for MSC-mediated immunosuppression in our model. These data suggest that patients undergoing HSCT should be monitored for IFN&#947;, and administered MSC when high levels are reached. Whilst MSC may be a promising therapy for patients with severe GVHD, we highlight that further investigation is warranted before MSC are accepted for widespread use in the clinic. The risks and benefits for transplant recipients should be carefully considered before utilising MSC to treat or prevent GVHD.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)</field><field name="subject">Graft-versus-host Disease (GVHD)</field><field name="subject">Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSC)</field><field name="subject">Interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Factors Affecting the Long Run Supply of Rubber from Sarawak, East Malaysia, 1900-1990: An Historical and Econometric Analysis</field><field name="creator">Purcell, Timothy</field><field name="description">The factors affecting the supply of rubber from Sarawak, East Malaysia, were identified and reviewed in an historical framework. A methodical framework for the general analysis of economic relationships between variables was reviewed and a practical application of the methodology to the supply of rubber from Sarawak was carried out. An econometric analysis of the long run factors affecting the production of rubber was carried out. (1) Two log-differenced autoregressive models of the rubber supply were formulated. (2) The models were tested for parameter constancy to identify structural breaks in the time series and for structural invariance to determine whether they were suitable for policy analysis, forecasting and backcasting. (3) The variables were tested for bivariate Granger Causality to determine the relationships between the factors of production and the output of rubber. (4) Forecast Error Variance Decomposition analysis of multivariate Granger Causality was carried out using a Vector Autoregressive Model. The results confirm the a priori economic theory that long run changes in supply have been affected primarily by changes in area under rubber production and long term price trends. The area planted to rubber has depended upon price incentives and the availability of scarce labour resources. Prices have been affected by the supply of rubber from Sarawak but this is posited to be a reflection of global supply trends affecting prices. While the results generally confirm the economic theory, caution is urged when interpreting the results. The severe inadequacies of the data used highlights the need for more accurate time series and the mainly methodological approach of this study.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">070106 Farm Management, Rural Management and Agribusiness</field><field name="subject">140303 Economic Models and Forecasting</field><field name="subject">rubber</field><field name="subject">rubber supply</field><field name="subject">Sarawak</field><field name="subject">econometric analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:206177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different? : or much of the same? : a descriptive study of the demographic and product usage profiles of media audiences, with implications for targeting strategy.</field><field name="creator">Nelson-Field, Karen</field><field name="description">Implicit in the use of the target audience concept is the assumption that audiences are highly segmented.

In particular, peptides are often a significant component of these chemical arsenals, and are fundamentally important as biological effector molecules. The research presented in this thesis is centred on the isolation and investigation of peptides from both frogs and spiders, and endeavours to probe the important structural and mechanistic features of these bioactive compounds. The skin peptide profiles of interspecific hybrids between the green tree frog Litoria caerulea and the magnificent tree frog Litoria splendida have been investigated in a ninemonth survey. Fourteen peptides were characterised primarily using mass spectrometry, of which three had not been identified previously in the skin secretions of either parent. A number of these peptides are antibacterial agents, while others effectively inhibit the formation of nitric oxide by neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Implications for the genetics and expression of amphibian dermal peptides are also discussed. The majority of frogs of the genus Litoria contain at least one peptide in their glandular secretion capable of inhibiting the formation of nitric oxide by the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase. This was proposed to occur by preventing the association of the regulatory cofactor, Ca&#178;&#8314; -calmodulin, with its binding site on the enzyme. Non-covalent binding of the amphibian peptides to calmodulin in the presence of Ca&#178;&#8314; has been confirmed using electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry, by the observation of complexes in the gas phase with a 1 : 1 : 4 calmodulin / peptide / Ca&#178;&#8314; stoichiometry. In addition, the structure and binding interactions of caerin 1.8, a potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, have been further probed using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy techniques. Recently a number of small, disulfide - containing neuropeptides of the signiferin and riparin families have been characterised from the skin secretion of frogs of the Crinia genus. Of these, signiferin 1 and riparin 1.1 are both ten residue peptides with similar primary sequences, however appear to have a significantly different spectrum of bioactivity. Although both act at cholecystokinin-2 receptors, signiferin 1 is smooth muscle active while riparin 1.1 is not, and instead causes proliferation of lymphocytes. The three-dimensional structures of these peptides were determined using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations. Both signiferin 1 and riparin 1.1 adopt &#946; - turn type conformations, however differences in these structures may be responsible for the variation in biological activity noted for these peptides. The dermal secretions of most Australian frogs contain at least one broad-spectrum peptide antibiotic, and often a series of peptides with differing activity to afford greater protection against microbial pathogens. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies were carried out to investigate the interaction of a number of these antibacterial peptides with anionic model membranes, and the results are compared with work previously reported using neutral lipids. It appears the peptides may have a different mode of interaction with the membranes depending upon the charge of the lipid head group. The cupiennin 1 peptides have been identified in the venom of the neotropical wandering spider, Cupiennius salei, and demonstrate potent wide-spectrum antibacterial activity. Primary sequence analysis of these peptides suggests a unique amphipathic structure distinctly different from that of other potentially helical cationic antimicrobial peptides isolated thus far. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and restrained molecular dynamics calculations, cupiennin 1a was found to adopt an &#945;- helical structure with a flexible central hinge region in membrane mimicking solvents. Following this, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy methods were used to further probe the antibacterial and the newly identified neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitory activity of this peptide.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peptides Analysis</field><field name="subject">Amphibians Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Anti-infective agents</field><field name="subject">Peptides Therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/37851</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial and temporal alterations of gene expression in rice.</field><field name="creator">Plett, Darren Craig</field><field name="description">Two problems hampering efforts to produce salt-tolerant plants through constitutive expression of transgenes include: 1. Spatial control. Particular cell-types must respond specifically to salt stress to minimise the amount of Na&#8314; delivered to the shoot; and, 2. Temporal control. Transgenes are typically expressed in plants at similar levels through time, irrespective of the stress encountered by the plant, which may exacerbate pleiotropic effects and means that, particularly in low-stress conditions, costly and/or detrimental metabolic processes may be active, thus reducing yield. To address these issues, Gateway&#174; destination vector constructs were developed combining the GAL4 UAS (upstream activating sequence) with the ethanol-inducible gene expression system to drive inducible cell-specific expression of Na&#8314; transporter transgenes (or to silence salt transporter transgenes inducibly and cell-specifically). Rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) GAL4-GFP enhancer trap lines (Johnson et al., 2005: Plant J. 41, 779-789) that express GAL4 and GFP specifically in either the root epidermis or xylem parenchyma (and therefore &#8216;trap&#8217; cell-type specific enhancer elements) were transformed with this GAL4 UAS &#8211; ethanol switch construct, thereby allowing both spatial and temporal control of transgenes. In preliminary experiments, the expression system successfully limited the expression of RFP to specific cell-types after induction with ethanol. Other genes expressed using this system include PpENA1, a Na&#8314;-extruding ATPase from the moss, Physcomitrella patens, and AtHKT1;1, a Na &#8314; transporter from Arabidopsis thaliana. The two enhancer trap rice lines were also transformed with the GAL4 UAS driving stable expression of AtHKT1;1 and PpENA1 specifically in root epidermal or xylem parenchyma cells. Expression of AtHKT1;1 in root epidermal cells reduced Na&#8314; accumulation in the shoots, while expression in the root xylem parenchyma appeared to have little effect on shoot Na&#8314; accumulation. Using cryo-scanning electron microscopy (SEM) X-ray microanalysis, the outer cells of the roots of the line expressing AtHKT1;1 in the epidermal cells were found to accumulate higher levels of Na&#8314; than the parental enhancer trap line. Additionally, this line had decreased unidirectional &#178;&#178;Na&#8314; influx.

Callus tissue was grown from E. camaldulensis stem pieces in aseptic conditions. Calli were prone to deterioration after 14 days unless transferred to fresh growth medium. Lower levels of solutes (25% Murashige and Skoog salts, 25% plant vitamins and 0.5% sucrose) were more successful than published concentrations. Fergusobia J2 nematodes were surface sterilised with either Hibitane or washed with water to prepare them for inoculation of callus (Hay, 1994). Fergusobia subsequently recovered from plates of callus were all dead, which raised questions of how the nematodes are suited to Murashige and Skoog salt solutions. The survival of Fergusobia in aqueous solutions was then observed. It has been assumed that Fergusobia live about 2 days after dissection. Amphimictic nematodes from E. camaldulensis axial bud galls were used for a survival study. Nematodes lived for as long as 12 days in fresh tap water and 11 days in 1% M.S. solution. They were more active in tap water than in 1% M.S. solution. Nematodes in a dish together with dissected gall material died within 2 days. Nematodes in a separate dish with fresh tap water and clean gall fibres were observed to gather around the fibres. Observations of Fergusobia could be made within fresh solutions providing deteriorating gall tissues were removed from the dish. Gall production was attempted on E. camaldulensis grown in the glasshouse. These tree saplings were pruned to encourage new growth and periodically treated for infestations of scale insects leading to growth of sooty mould. Two forms of cage construction were used: (1) 1 m &#179; screened cages and (2) acetate sleeves as used by Goolsby et al., 2000. Within the 1 m &#179; cages containing flies, the growing points on saplings were blackened, possibly due to over-exploitation by ovipositing flies. One growing point caged in an acetate sleeve showed oviposition scars but did not produce a mature gall. Production of galls in the glasshouse was hindered by a lack in coincidence of flies emerging from mature galls and the flush of new growth following pruning. The production of galls within the glasshouse was not achieved. The phenology of E. camaldulensis, a host for the Fergusonina/Fergusobia mutualism, and gall ecology were observed in a two-year, non-destructive, field study in the Urrbrae Wetlands, Adelaide, South Australia. Tree growth and gall development was observed in the lower regions (0 &#8211; 2 m) of young trees. Three bud forms, terminal leaf bud, axial leaf bud and flower bud galls were monitored on the trees. The densities of galls were highly seasonal. Greatest density of growing points, axial leaf bud and flower bud galls occurred mostly during mid-winter to spring, whereas that of terminal leaf bud galls occurred during mid-spring to summer. Galling of flower buds did not appear to influence flowering and more flower buds and flowers occurred in the second year of the study as the trees matured. Trees mostly had medium (30-70%) levels of leaf damage, but there were seasonal trends in damage levels. Low scores for leaf damage were associated with increases in flower bud and flower production. Leaf damage, including sooty mould, appeared to increase during the cooler winter months. There were no significant seasonal relationships between levels of leaf damage and either growing point density or the occurrence of galls. When trees were compared with each other, those with lower leaf damage were more likely to have more growing points. The appearance of the canopy and the likelihood of a tree to have galls varied greatly between the trees. One tree was particularly susceptible to leaf attack, rarely had new leaves and produced no mature galls during the study. The colouring of leaves varied between trees, which indicates possible genetic variations causing some trees to be more likely hosts for Fergusonina/Fergusobia. Both new vegetative growth and terminal leaf bud galls were concentrated on the northern and eastern quadrants. Axial leaf bud and flower bud galls occurred more on the western or southern quadrants where they were possibly more protected from sun exposure on the northern or eastern quadrants. Axial galls on the northern side of one tree became reddened while those in the southern and western quadrants remained green. Reddening of axial galls may increase their likelihood of parasitism and predation by birds. Each of the three gall forms occurred within certain positions in the canopy. The tree host resource is partitioned effectively, with the three gall forms occurring on three different host structures. Additionally, the two vegetative forms terminal leaf bud and axial leaf bud galls occur on different shoot regions and in different seasons. The numbers of the galls is probably also affected by biotic and climatic influences. Parasitism, plant canopy shading, nutrient levels and host genetics are possible influences. Assuming an interval of 4 weeks between oviposition and first observation within the current study, terminal leaf bud galls had an average longevity of 11 weeks and axial leaf bud galls an average longevity of 14 weeks. Flower bud galls had longevities of 14 to 27 weeks from oviposition to senescence, assuming an interval of 6 weeks between oviposition and first observation within the current study. Flowers and flower buds occur irregularly within the eucalypts so it would be advantageous for flies and nematodes developing within flower bud galls to have extended or variable longevities to allow fly emergences to coincide with new flower buds. Not all of the galls recorded matured to produce adult flies. Nearly half of the terminal leaf bud galls initiated were aborted, recorded as absent, parasitised or eaten (45% of initiated galls). Of the three gall forms, they were the most prone to obvious parasitism and as many as 12 hymenopteran species have been reared from terminal leaf bud galls on E. camaldulensis (Taylor et al., 1996). These galls obviously provide a resource for many species within multiple trophic levels. Fourteen percent of axial leaf bud galls were absent or eaten and birds were seen breaking off and feeding on the galls. More than half (55%) of the initiated flower bud galls disappeared during the period of observation, possibly due to the foraging of birds. Destructive sampling and rearing out of parasitoids from both axial leaf bud and flower bud gall forms is needed to establish what species exist within them. Terminal leaf bud galls ranged from 7.5 to 30.1 mm in diameter and 10.0 to 43.6 mm in length. Flower bud gall size varied, with the largest being 15.0 mm by 22.3 mm. Axial leaf bud galls, ranged from 2.6 to 13.0 mm in diameter and length ranged from 2.3 to 10.5 mm. The larger axial leaf bud galls were nodular and appeared to have multiple locules. Destructive sampling and rearing out of flies is needed to establish the relationship between size and numbers of flies emerging. Terminal leaf bud galls increased in size, including many locules and exit holes per gall. Axial leaf bud galls were much smaller than the terminal leaf bud galls and 99% had only one to three exit holes. The rounded shape and presence of few locules within the axial leaf bud galls indicate that this form is limited to a shape and size producing few flies. The observation of greater size of terminal leaf bud galls suggests that these galls may have multiple foundresses. Twelve of the 13 flower bud galls with exit holes had either one or two holes. In flower bud galls on E. camaldulensis. the operculum remains sealed and the characteristic Fergusonina &#8220;window&#8221; appears at the side of the flower bud before fly emergence through a single hole. Destructive sampling is also necessary to determine parasitism of each of the gall forms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nematode; fly; gall; ecology</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus camaldulensis--Diseases and pests--South Australia</field><field name="subject">Nematoda.</field><field name="subject">Galls (Botany)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/48390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pivotal role of insulin-like growth factors in pregnancy success.</field><field name="creator">Sferruzzi-Perri, Amanda Nancy</field><field name="description">Appropriate placental development in early gestation is essential for subsequent placental function and hence optimal fetal growth and pregnancy outcome. Placental insufficiency has been implicated in common disorders of pregnancy, which result in fetal and maternal mortality or morbidity, and also increase the risk of poor health in adult offspring. Prior to the onset of maternal blood flow to the placenta at ~10 weeks of gestation, placentation occurs in a relatively hypoxic environment, which is essential for healthy pregnancy. IGF-II is abundantly expressed by the invasive trophoblast and may interact with oxygen to regulate placentation. Additionally, maternally-derived IGFs may act on the placenta and the mother to regulate fetal growth. This thesis investigated the role and interaction of oxygen and IGF-II on human placental outgrowth during early pregnancy in vitro. Furthermore, the impact of maternal IGF treatment during early to mid pregnancy, on placental development and substrate transfer, nutrient partitioning between the mother and fetus, and fetal growth, were also determined in mid and late gestation in guinea pigs. We have demonstrated, using human early first trimester placental villous explants, that IGF-II mediates the effect of hypoxia on placental outgrowth. Culture of placental explants in hypoxia, or with exogenous IGF-II, enhanced trophoblast outgrowth and inhibited TGF-&#946;1 activation, a negative regulator of trophoblast function. In addition, culture of explants in hypoxia induced Igf2 gene expression in outgrowing trophoblast, without altering Upar, Igf1r, Igf2r or Tgf&#946;1 transcription. We propose that this novel interaction of oxygen, IGF-II and TGF-&#946;1 during pregnancy is an important determinant of placental development. Furthermore, we showed that exogenous IGF-II stimulates villous explant trophoblast outgrowth in placenta from &gt;10 weeks gestation, suggesting that IGF-II may be a potential therapeutic agent to enhance placental growth. In guinea pigs, maternal treatment with IGF-I or IGF-II, in early to mid pregnancy, has sustained anabolic effects on fetal growth, enhanced fetal survival and increased placental delivery, and fetal and maternal utilization of, glucose and amino acids near term. These effects were also evident by mid gestation following earlier IGF-I treatment. Despite these similar pregnancy outcomes, there were IGF specific effects on the placenta and mother, suggesting that IGFs may mediate some of their effects via different pathways. IGF-I administration severely reduced maternal adiposity in late pregnancy, elicited its effects by substantially improving development of the placental exchange region, which correlated with placental function. We have suggested that the discrete effects of IGF-I and IGF-II stem from distinct interactions of the IGFs with various receptors. Maternal administration of an analogue of IGF-II that selectively interacts with IGF2R (Leu &#178;&#8311;-IGF-II), revealed that many of the effects of IGF-II treatment, were mediated by IGF2R, while IGF-I presumably acts through IGF1R. Together, this work has highlighted the major and somewhat complementary roles of maternal IGFs during the first half of pregnancy, in regulating placental development, fetal growth and pregnancy success. Importantly, it indicates the potential use of maternal IGFs in diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to pregnancy complications.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Somatomedin.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Weed resistance risk management in glyphosate-resistant cotton</field><field name="creator">Werth, Jeff Alan</field><field name="description">The introduction of glyphosate resistance into Australian cotton systems will have an effect on conventional weed management practices, the weed species present and the risk of glyphosate resistance evolving in weed species. Therefore, it is important that the effects of these management practices, particularly a potential reduction in Integrated Weed Management (IWM) practices, be examined to determine their impact on weed population dynamics and resistance selection. The study began in 2003 with a survey of 40 growers in four major cotton growing regions in Australia to gain an understanding of how adoption of glyphosate resistance had influenced the weed spectrum, weed management practices and herbicide use after three years of glyphosate-resistant cotton being available. The 10 most common weeds reported on cotton fields were the same in glyphosate-resistant and conventional fields. In this survey, herbicide use patterns were altered by the adoption of glyphosate-resistant cotton with up to six times more glyphosate being applied and with 21% fewer growers applying pre-emergence herbicides in glyphosate-resistant cotton fields. Other weed control practices, such as the use of post-emergence herbicides, inter-row cultivation and hand hoeing, were only reduced marginally. A systems experiment was conducted to determine differences in the population dynamics of Echinochloa crus-galli (barnyardgrass) and Urochloa panicoides (liverseed grass) under a range of weed management regimes in a glyphosate-resistant cotton system. These treatments ranged from a full IWM system to a system based soley on the use of glyphosate. The experiment investigated the effect of the treatments on the soil seed bank, weed germination patterns and weed numbers in the field. All applied treatments resulted in commercially acceptable control of the two grass weeds. However, the treatments containing soil-applied residual herbicides proved to be more effective over the period of the experiment. The treatment with a reduced residual herbicide program supplemented with glyphosate had a level of control similar to the full IWM treatments with less input, providing a more economical option. The effectiveness of these treatments in the long-term was examined in a simulation model to determine the likelihood of glyphosate resistance evolving using barnyardgrass and liverseed grass as model weeds. Seed production and above-ground biomass of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass in competition with cotton were measured. In all experiments, seed production and biomass plant&#8315;&#185;  decreased as weed density increased while seed production and biomass m&#8315;&#185; tended to increase. Seed production m&#8315;&#185; reached 40,000 and 60,000 for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. In 2004-05, weeds were also planted 6 weeks and 12 weeks after the cotton was planted. Biomass and seed production of the two weeds planted 6 weeks after cotton were significantly reduced with seed production declining to 12,000 and 2,500 seeds m&#8315;&#185; row for barnyardgrass and liverseed grass, respectively. Weeds planted 12 weeks after cotton planting failed to emerge. This experiment highlighted the importance of early season weed control and effective management of weeds that are able to produce high seed numbers. A glyphosate dose-mortality experiment was conducted in the field to determine levels of control of barnyardgrass and liverseed grass. Glyphosate provided effective control of both species with over 85% control when the rate applied was greater than 690 g ae ha&#8315;&#185;. Dose-mortality curves for both species were obtained for use in the glyphosate resistance model. Data from the experimental work were combined to develop a glyphosate resistance model. Outputs from this model suggest that if glyphosate were used as the only form of weed control, resistance in weeds is likely to eventuate after 12 to 17 years, depending on the characteristics of the weed species, initial resistance gene frequencies and any associated fitness penalties. If glyphosate was used in conjunction with one other weed control method, resistance was delayed but not prevented. The simulations suggested that when a combination of weed control options was employed in addition to glyphosate, resistance would not evolve over the 30-year period of the simulation. These simulations underline the importance of an integrated strategy in weed management to prevent glyphosate resistance evolving from the use of glyphosate-resistant cotton. Current management conditions of growing glyphosate-resistant (Roundup Ready &amp;reg) cotton should therefore prevent glyphosate resistance evolution.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cotton, weeds--control, herbicides, herbicide resistance, glyphosate</field><field name="subject">Weeds Control</field><field name="subject">Cotton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical modelling of mixing between rectangular jets present in tangentially fired brown coal boilers.</field><field name="creator">Scarsella, Alessio Angelo</field><field name="description">Large scale power generation commences with the combustion of coal or other fuel, which in turn converts high pressure water into steam which then drives a turbine thus generating electricity. Burning high moisture coal, such as lignite, for power generation implies that a significant amount of energy is wasted in vaporising the moisture, which could otherwise be used in the steam raising process. This implies that more moist coal would be required to drive the same process than if the coal was drier, thus increasing the amount of combustion products such as greenhouses gases. Introducing a dried coal in an existing boiler will significantly change the heat flux profiles, which could result in boiler damage or excessive fouling. Flame temperature is influenced by the supply of reactants; in most cases the limiting reactant will be oxygen. The supply of oxygen (through air) to a pneumatically transported coal stream and subsequent reaction is controlled by the localised fluid mechanics or &#8216;mixing&#8217;. This research aims to provide an understanding of the mixing process between the pneumatically transported coal and air in brown coal fired boilers by modelling the individual jets. The effects of the change in velocity ratio for the air (secondary) jets and fuel (primary) jets of rectangular burners typical of those found in brown coal fired boilers has been studied experimentally and is reported in this thesis. In particular, scientific analysis was used to investigate the physical mechanisms which control fuel-air mixing, and to quantify the concentration of primary and secondary fluid. The concentration data was used in a regression model in conjunction with a reactive combustion model, developed from a 1:30 scale cold model of the Yallourn W&#8217; stage 2 boiler, in order that overall boiler performance can be assessed. This overall study is fundamental as a result of the questions raised concerning the future of brown coal in modern society. A qualitative flow visualisation study of the unconfined 1:30 scaled primary, and two adjacent rectangular jets, was conducted using single colour planar laser induced fluorescence. The characteristics of the jet flow were examined by imaging individually seeded primary and secondary jets and were visualised through four different planes longitudinally, on the axes of each jet. In addition, a transverse qualitative and quantitative study on the rectangular jets was also conducted for the individually seeded jets, and was visualised through planes of flow perpendicular to the direction flow, specifically at axial stations of x/D =0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. The flow characteristics were also examined under different co-flow conditions, particularly secondary to primary jet velocity ratios (&#955;) of 0, 0.55, 1.4, 2.8, 3.6 and &#8734;. This quantitative data yields the basis for a 3D regression model to predict fuel-air mixing in actual boilers. A semi-quantitative investigation into some geometrical modifications on the rectangular jets was also conducted at velocity ratios of &#955;=0, 0.55 and 1.4. The rectangular nozzles were fitted with base plates orientated at 90 degrees and 60 degrees to the direction of flow. The longitudinal flow visualisation study highlighted the effect of velocity ratio on the flow field of the primary and secondary jets. In particular it showed that the main structures of the primary and secondary jets are sensitive to the co-flowing conditions. The primary jet also experienced the formation of coherent structures close to the bluff body re-circulation region for &#955;&gt;2.8. The quantitative transverse analysis of the rectangular jets showed that the primary jet and secondary jets close to the nozzle exit plane distorted with a change in co-flowing conditions. The primary jet experienced distortion for &#955;&gt;1.4, and the secondary jets experienced distortion for &#955; &lt;1.4. A plausible mechanism for this &#8220;distortion&#8221; can be explained by different co-flowing conditions altering the velocity gradients of the jet, thus changing the denomination of the counter rotating vortices present in the corners of rectangular jets, allowing them to alter jet shape. The transverse quantitative analysis of the rectangular jets allowed for graphical representation of the normalised concentration of the primary and secondary jets in the radial direction and the centreline mixture fraction decay. The analysis of the latter showed that the primary jet, under all co-flow conditions, reached self-similarity at approximately x/D =4, whereas the secondary jets did so at x/D =2. The primary jets observed greater rates of centreline dilution at high velocity ratios, whereas the secondary jets did so at &#955;=0.55. The quantification of the centreline concentration decay obeyed the inverse rate law for all co-flowing conditions. The first order decay constant K&#8321;, was found to be heavily dependant on velocity ratio. The planar transverse quantitative data of the primary and secondary jets was used with the method of weighted squares to develop a regression model that would three-dimensionally reproduce the scalar mixing field as a function of velocity ratio. The regression model reproduces scalar quantities for &#955;=0 and &#955;=0.55 to 3.6 for the primary jet and &#955;=0.55 to 3.6 and &#8734; for the secondary jet, and is capable of predicting primary and secondary bulk fluid concentrations within 30 to 40 % of the measured values. A sensitivity analysis on the regression model revealed that it is highly responsive to the momentum-controlling region between the jets with a change in velocity ratio.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rectangular jets; scalar; concentration; tangentially fired boilers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutagenesis of the Yeast ALR1 Mg Transport Gene</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jong-min</field><field name="description">Magnesium is an essential element and the most abundant divalent cation in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, but its transport is not well understood. Mutagenesis was used to study the function of the ALR1 (aluminium resistance) gene, which encodes the major Mg2+ uptake system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Random PCR mutagenesis was undertaken of the C-terminal part of ALR1 that is homologous to the bacterial CorA magnesium transport family. The mutants with the most severe phenotype all had amino acid changes in a small region of Alr1 containing the putative transmembrane (TM) domains. Eighteen single amino acid mutants in this critical region were classified into three categories: no, low and moderate activity. One &#8216;no activity&#8217; mutation, M762L, affected the GMN motif that is a characteristic of the CorA super-family genes. Two other conservative mutations that reduced or inactivated uptake led me to identify Ser729 and Ile746 as critical amino acid residues in Alr1. High expression of inactive mutants inhibited the capability of the wild-type Alr1 protein to transport magnesium, consistent with the idea that Alr1 may form homo-oligomers. The results confirm the classification of ALR1 as a member of the CorA family of magnesium transport genes Random mutagenesis was also undertaken of the critical region of Alr1 containing the TM domains, in order to find important residues for Al3+ toxicity. Two types of Altolerant mutants were obtained: one with increased sensitivity to Co2+ and a second with no change in sensitivity to Co2+ ions. The former class was shown to have an increased rate of Mg2+ uptake, consistent with the hypothesis that Al3+ toxicity results from Mg2+ deficiency via inhibition of Alr1 activity. The latter class of mutants was shown to have normal rates of Mg2+ uptake but with a reduced sensitivity to inhibition by Al3+ ions. The three individual mutants in the latter class were combined in all combinations and the results indicated that their Al3+ tolerance was likely to be additive and that the mutants operate independently. The most tolerant mutant in this class, I746L, involved a conservative change (alteration of the relative location of methyl groups on the amino acid side chain), to a residue that is located within a TM and that was shown above to be critical for Mg2+ uptake. Therefore, Ile746 plays a very important role in both Mg2+ uptake and Al3+ tolerance in Alr1. These results indicate that Al3+ may inhibit Mg2+ uptake by directly competing for binding sites within the pore of the Alr1 protein. Truncation of N-terminal extension of Alr1 showed that the N-terminal 239 amino acids and the C-terminal 53 amino acids are not essential for magnesium uptake. They might be serving some other functions such as protein regulation. In conclusion, these mutagenesis results firmly establish ALR1 as a magnesium transport gene belonging to the CorA super-family and provide direct experimental support for the hypothesis that Al3+ toxicity in yeast occurs by direct inhibition of Mg2+ uptake via the Alr1 protein.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

One way of controlling postoperative pain is administration of a single analgesic or a combination of different classes of analgesics prior to the onset of noxious stimuli. A constraint to the perioperative use of traditional opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is their undesirable side effects. In this series of experiments, the preventive (pre-emptive) analgesic efficacy of two popular human analgesics, tramadol (an ?atypical? opioid) and parecoxib (a NSAID with selective COX-2 inhibition) was evaluated in dogs. Initially, the efficacy and renal safety of parecoxib, tramadol and a combination of parecoxib, tramadol and pindolol (a -adrenoceptor blocker and 5-HT1A/1B antagonist) were screened in anaesthetised healthy dogs. These analgesics increased the dogs? nociceptive threshold to mechanical stimuli, without causing significant alterations in the dogs? glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimated by plasma iohexol clearance. Subsequently, the efficacy of tramadol was compared with morphine, in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy or castration. The Glasgow composite measure pain scale-short form score (CMPS-SF) and changes in intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) responses were used to assess the efficacy of analgesics. Of the three treatment groups (preoperative morphine, 0.5 mg kg-1; preoperative tramadol, 3 mg kg-1; a ?combination? of preoperative low-dose morphine, 0.1 mg kg-1, and postoperative tramadol 3 mg kg-1), dogs given the ?combination? had significantly lower pain scores after ovariohysterectomy. In castrated dogs, preoperative tramadol (3 mg kg-1) and morphine (0.5 mg kg-1) were tested and no significant difference in the CMPS-SF score were observed between them. Changes in EEG variables were not specific between the treatment groups in ovariohysterectomised dogs. Finally, the efficacy of test drugs was evaluated against acute noxious electrical stimulation in anaesthetised dogs, using EEG. Median frequency of the EEG, a reliable indicator of nociception, increased significantly in tramadol and parecoxib groups, compared to morphine, after electrical stimulation. These studies demonstrated that tramadol and parecoxib can produce analgesia in dogs with insignificant side effects. The efficacy of tramadol appears to vary with the type of noxious stimulus. A complete prevention of noxious input by administration of analgesics pre- and post-operatively could have important clinical applications.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analgesics</field><field name="subject">anaesthesia</field><field name="subject">pain relief</field><field name="subject">dog surgery</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300502 Anaesthesiology and intensive care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Least-squares optimal interpolation for direct image super-resolution : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gilman, Andrew</field><field name="description">Image super-resolution aims to produce a higher resolution representation of a scene from an ensemble of low-resolution images that may be warped, aliased, blurred and degraded by noise. There are a variety of methods for performing super-resolution described in the literature, and in general they consist of three major steps: image registration, fusion and deblurring. This thesis proposes a novel method of performing the first two of these steps. The ultimate aim of image super-resolution is to produce a higher-quality image that is visually clearer, sharper and contains more detail than the individual input images. Machine algorithms can not assess images qualitatively and typically use a quantitative error criterion, often least-squares. This thesis aims to optimise leastsquares directly using a fast method, in particular one that can be implemented using linear filters; hence, a closed-form solution is required. The concepts of optimal interpolation and resampling are derived and demonstrated in practice. Optimal filters optimised on one image are shown to perform nearoptimally on other images, suggesting that common image features, such as stepedges, can be used to optimise a near-optimal filter without requiring the knowledge of the ground-truth output. This leads to the construction of a pulse model, which is used to derive filters for resampling non-uniformly sampled images that result from the fusion of registered input images. An experimental comparison shows that a 10th order pulse model-based filter outperforms a number of methods common in the literature. The use of optimal interpolation for image registration linearises an otherwise nonlinear problem, resulting in a direct solution. Experimental analysis is used to show that optimal interpolation-based registration outperforms a number of existing methods, both iterative and direct, at a range of noise levels and for both heavily aliased images and images with a limited degree of aliasing. The proposed method offers flexibility in terms of the size of the region of support, offering a good trade-off in terms of computational complexity and accuracy of registration. Together, optimal interpolation-based registration and fusion are shown to perform fast, direct and effective super-resolution.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image resolution</field><field name="subject">optimal filters</field><field name="subject">optimal interpolation</field><field name="subject">image registration</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291600 Computer Software::291601 Arithmetic and logic structures</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/893</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's experiment with prudential regulation : can disclosure discipline moderate excessive risk taking in New Zealand deposit taking institutions? : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Albany</field><field name="creator">Wilson, William Robert</field><field name="description">The New Zealand economy in the period up to 2006 provides an opportunity to assess an alternative disclosure based approach to the prudential regulation of deposittakers, in a market free of many of the distortions which arise from traditional regulatory schemes. The overall objective of this research has been to assess the effectiveness of the prudential regulation of New Zealand financial institutions and judge if the country is well served by it. Analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s registered bank sector suggests public disclosure adds value to New Zealand&#8217;s financial system. However, the significant relationship found between disclosure risk indicators and bank risk premiums was not as a result of market discipline, rather it is argued self-discipline was the mechanism, demonstrating bank management and directors are discharging their duties in a prudent manner. A feature of the New Zealand disclosure regime for banks is the significant responsibilities placed on bank directors; directors are then held accountable for their actions. Findings in the management of banks were in contrast to non-bank deposittakers, where disclosure was judged to be ineffective, and of no practical use due to its poor quality. The management of non-bank deposit-takers appeared to receive very little oversight from depositors, their trustees or official agencies. As a result, many appear to have managed their institution in their own interests, with little consideration given to other stakeholders. Failures which occurred in NBDTs from 2006 resulted from deficiencies in the prudential regulation of these deposit-takers, demonstrating the severity of asymmetric information and moral hazard problems which can arise if prudential regulation is not correctly designed and management interests are not aligned with other stakeholders. The New Zealand disclosure regime will never guarantee a bank will not fail, nor should it try to do so, but it should assist the functioning of a sound and efficient financial system. To this end, it is recommended that the Reserve Bank, in re-designing the regulatory framework for NBDTs, hold the management and directors of NBDTs similarly accountable, while also incorporating regular disclosure and minimum prudential standards. Governments have an important role to play in ensuring the financial system is efficient.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Banks</field><field name="subject">Prudential regulation</field><field name="subject">Disclosure</field><field name="subject">Risk taking</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Banking state supervision</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350300 Banking, Finance and Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol policy process in Thailand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thaksaphon, Thamarangsi</field><field name="description">The thesis describes and analyses the Thai alcohol policy process in the period 1997 - 2006, in order to investigate the characteristics and areas for potential improvement of the Thai alcohol policy process. The analysis used several extant public policy models. The models covered three aspects of the process at the macro leve l : stages of development, the characteristics and behaviours of maj or policy players, and the policy context. At the micro level the analysis employs concepts of agenda setting, policy formulation, policy implementation, monitoring and evaluation, stakeholder relationships and policy context. Information on Thai alcohol policy was collected from two sources: secondary data included official documents, literature, technical publications and mass media; pnmary data was collected through stakeholder interviews. Thai alcohol policy, during this period became more comprehensive and more oriented to public health. Problem-reduction values gained momentum while economic values remained significant. Thai policy stakeholders focused on the formulation process, while implementation, monitoring and evaluation were neglected. Limited resources, human capacity and ineffective management exacerbated this situation. Incrementalism characterised Thai alcohol policy formulation; existing policy or the policy precursor was very important to the decisions made. Limitations in the availability, accuracy and utilisation of knowledge about alcohol consumption, related problems and alcohol policy also affected the process. The Thai alcohol policy process became a more open public policy sphere for stakeholders. Many new players made major contributions to the process. The mechanisms stakeholders use to influence policy have become more complex and included: technical knowledge, the use of mass media and civil movements, and coordination among stakeholders. A centralised bureaucratic administration and personal and institutional interests are critical features for official stakeholders, while connection to high ranking officials and representation in the process are significant for interest groups. The Thai cultural context had a crucial impact on the alcohol policy process; cultural features which are not explicitly covered in the Western policy models utilised include cronyism, relationships, representation, commitment, negligence, and compromise. These characteristics make the Thai alcohol policy process difficult to fully explain in terms of the available public policy theories.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public policy</field><field name="subject">Policy and culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital reporting formats and users of financial reports : decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the context of recognition versus disclosure : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Accountancy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ghani, Erlane K.</field><field name="description">The evolvement of digital reporting has changed the way financial information is prepared and disseminated (Debreceny and Gray, 200 1 ). Previous research has shown that digital reporting has increased, particularly in the last five years, and this usage is characterised by greater volumes of business and financial information over that traditionally provided in print-based mode (Smith, 2003). The new opportunities and benefits offered by digital reporting are matched by challenges and implications not only for the preparers and auditors but also for users. It is expected that in the near future, financial reporting will move entirely from the primarily print-based mode to digital-based mode as the primary information dissemination channel (Oyelere et aI., 2003; Fisher et aI., 2004). Research in the area of digital reporting has been conducted in the past decade. Within this research, a considerable number of issues have been raised. These issues relate to various parties, such as policy makers, preparers, auditors, system designers and users. While several research questions and hypotheses concerning these parties have been posed and investigated, most of the research questions and hypotheses have been formed from a preparers' perspective, leaving the examination of issues from a users' perspective largely unexplored. This study focuses on users. It examines the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance in relation to decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the digital reporting environment. It aims to extend the digital reporting literature. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on digital reporting environment in several ways. First, this study examines the effect of presentation formats on the quality of users' decision making. This study follows Kleinmuntz and Schkade (1993) who described 'decision quality' in the context of two cost-benefit dimensions in relation to decision makers' cognitive processes, namely decision accuracy and cognitive effort. Decision accuracy reflects the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate outcome while cognitive effort reflects the total cognitive expenditure incurred in completing a task. Second, this study examines users' perceptions of three digital presentation formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. This study compares subjects' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of the three presentation formats with their actual outcome. It also includes examining whether perceptions are an important factor in influencing preferred presentation format. Finally, this study examines whether digital presentation formats address the concern over functional fixation in the accounting context of 'recognition versus disclosure' in the reporting of financial information. This study used public accounting practitioners in New Zealand as participants. Sixty two subjects participated in the experiment, which involves an experiment exercise and a post experiment questionnaire. The results indicate that presentation formats impact on decision accuracy. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted using non-digital presentation formats such as tabular and graphical in the psychology and information systems literature (Stock and Watson, 1984; Dickson et aI., 1986; Iselin, 1988; DeSanctis and Jarvenpaa, 1989; Mackay and Villareal, 1987; Hard and Vanacek, 1991; Stone and Schkade, 1991; Anderson and Kaplan, 1992; Bricker and Nehmer, 1995; Ramarapu et aI., 1997; Frownfelter-Lohrke, 1998; Almer et aI., 2003). The results, however, indicate that presentation formats do not impact decision makers' cognitive effort. These findings suggest that preparers, standardsetters and regulatory bodies should recognise that presentation format impacts on users' decision making processes and select appropriate formats that lead to improvement in decision making. Additionally, the results indicate that users' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the reporting technologies are similar across the three presentation formats. The results also show that users' perceptions do not necessary correspond to actual performance. Users' perceptions are found to influence their preferred presentation format. The findings of this study provide useful insights on users' perceptions, performances and preferences of the digital presentation formats. Such results provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the importance of perceptions and the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance. This is particularly relevant since if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, then there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of presentation. Finally, the results show that of the four recognised stages of information processing (i.e. acquisition, evaluation, weighting and judging information), functional fixation is found to only exist at the judgment stage. However, the effect of presentation format is only significant at information evaluation stage. The results indicate that the interaction between presentation formats and placement of information does not affect decision makers' information processing. This suggests that presentation formats do not solve the concern about recognition versus disclosure (functional fixation) in information processing stages. These fmdings are not consistent with Hodge et al. (2004) but are consistent with Luft and Shields (2001) who suggest functional fixation could not be alleviated because the accounting itself would affect the allocation of people's attention. This study extends the literature on presentation format by examining the quality of decision making arising from the use of different presentation formats in a digital reporting environment. It provides evidence that users' perceptions of ease of use of a presentation format do not necessarily correspond to their actual performance (cognitive effort) once a particular task has been performed. This study also provides evidence that the acceptance of a technology is highly dependent on the perceptions of that technology. Therefore, limited knowledge and appreciation of the capabilities of a technology may have the undesired effect of deterring use of the technology although it may improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and control of unmanned ground vehicles.</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thanh Hung</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Much of the work focussed on roads, commonly encountered features in the habitat of both species. The habitat requirements based on locality records of both frogs in the Sydney Basin were investigated at four spatial scales. Both species are habitat specialists. They showed a strong geological association with Hawkesbury Sandstone and occupy upper topographic areas with ephemeral watercourses of gentle gradients. Both frogs occur predominantly in areas of higher precipitation and milder temperature regimes compared to averages representative of the region. Leaf litter is an important feature of P. australis breeding sites, whereas H australiacus generally associate with crayfish burrows. Both species are dependent on natural vegetation with a complex structure. H australiacus have a relatively long larval period (3 - 12 months) and breed in ephemeral pools, exposing their tadpoles to the risk of dying due to early pond drying. In the laboratory, tadpoles responded to decreasing water levels by shortening their larval periods and metamorphosing earlier than siblings held at constant water level. Despite this plastic response, a number of pools in the field failed to produce metamorphs due to early drying, an observation also made on P. australis. Regular monitoring of breeding sites revealed increased reproductive success away from roads for both species probably because of relatively longer hydroperiods. Spatial distributions and associations with habitat features, and movement patterns of both frogs were further investigated using mark-recapture methods. Both species showed strong site fidelity. P. australis formed small aggregations and predominantly selected leaf litter piles despite their relatively low availability. Leaf litter piles in creeks moved over time and the animals moved with these piles. In contrast, H australiacus individuals formed no aggregations and showed no preference for any available structural vegetation type. Locations of individuals were independent of relative distances to creeks and artificial drains, but males appeared to be more common near culverts. However, individuals were randomly distributed in space and nearest-neighbour distances were high relative to individual movement distances, suggesting minimal overlap between relatively large home ranges. Radio-telemetry demonstrated that some H australiacus individuals burrow in the road environment. There they would be at risk of being dug up and possibly injured during road works. The results are discussed in relation to the spatial requirements of both species and the protection of utilised habitat features. Management options are suggested to mitigate the impacts of road works. Differences in spatial dynamics of both frogs with overlapping habitats highlighted in this study require species-specific management approaches.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toads.</field><field name="subject">Heleioporus Australiacus.</field><field name="subject">Pseudophryne Australis.</field><field name="subject">Endangered species.</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of immunological assays for the monitoring and diagnosis of selected infectious diseases, with emphasis on neosporosis.</field><field name="creator">Reichel, Michael Philipp.</field><field name="description">The 16 publications presented in this thesis summarise the author&#8217;s contribution to seroepidemiological approaches for the diagnosis and monitoring of animal diseases of importance to New Zealand. The first four publications not only contribute to the above in relation to three important animal pathogens, namely Brucella ovis, Mycobacterium avium spp. paratuberculosis and Bovine Leukaemia Virus but also give an insight into more general consideration associated with the optimisation and validation of serological assays, namely regarding the definition and choice of gold standard reference sera, the determination of the cutoff threshold and discrimination between negative and positive reference populations. Two further publications deal with the establishment and validation of serological assays for the diagnosis of Neospora caninum infection and abortion in New Zealand. Then, baseline data were obtained for the sero-prevalence of the infection in dog and cattle populations in New Zealand. Three case studies provided initially information about the kinetics of serological responses after a N caninum abortion outbreak, and information about the usefulness of herd-based techniques rather than individual cowbased abortion diagnoses. A further study provided some early information about the mode of transmission seemingly predominating in New Zealand, which tends to be mainly via post-natal infection, in contrast to evidence provided by overseas researchers. A final case study, a longitudinal study of serological and other responses over a period of three years also provided data on the production effects of N caninum. The dissertation is completed by a number of reviews on sero-diagnosis of N caninum infection, its presence in Australasia and suggests finally control options, based on the present state of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neospora caninum.</field><field name="subject">Immunology.</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology.</field><field name="subject">Cattle.</field><field name="subject">Diagnosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological modernisation of industry : developing multi-disciplinary research in organization &amp; environment.</field><field name="creator">Orssato, Renato J.</field><field name="description">This thesis develops suitable approaches to conduct environment-related research in organisations, as well as systematic means for understanding the emergent phenomenon of ecological modernisation in industrialised societies. The study is organised in two distinct parts: While Part I deals with environment-related theories and practices in (and around) modern organisations, Part II situates such theories and practices in an analysis of the context of the European automobile industry. The research problem is defined through several stages. The research questions driving Part I are premised on the exploratory nature of the study, developed in an unfolding interplay between the review of the literature, the collection of secondary and (exploratory) primary data, and the analysis and interpretation of the data. As the initial question is answered by reviewing the literature and interpreting the primary and secondary data, another question arises from the process, which then requires further research. Part II of the study departs from a proposition based on ecological modernisation theory, that pro-active environmental practices in corporations are part of a broader emergent sociological phenomenon, typical of modern industrialised societies. It analyses a specific socio-technical context that, hypothetically, is undergoing such process - that of the European automobile industry. Hence, the development of Part II aims at answering the following principal research question: Why is the European automobile industry undergoing ecological modernisation? Analytically, the concept of automobile field is proposed to establish a link between the product (automobile) and the context embedding its systems of production and consumption (field). The exploratory character of the study implied that the most adequate research procedures were of a qualitative nature. A combination of grounded theory and reflexive methodology is used to orientate the overall research process, which introduces a novel approach for the triangulation of qualitative data. Together, the chapters forming Part II of the thesis answer the principal research question. The fundamental technologies of the current technological regime of the automobile, as well as the economic and environmental implications of this regime are analysed. Then, an analysis of selected pilot programs to develop and commercialise electric vehicles, as well as schemes for the management of end-of-life vehicles in the Western European context is developed. Through the interplay between data collection and analysis, the thesis designs an analytical framework, built upon contingent factors, as well as circuits of political ecology, that foster or inhibit ecological modernisation in the automobile field. The study showed that the auto industry has developed incremental technological innovations and practices that resemble the pre-requisites for ecological modernisation. Radical innovations, however, are more likely to be initiated by outsiders. The concepts inherited from the past and reproduced in the present practice of car design explains such a situation as one that imposes a specific set of technologies on car manufacturing that require high levels of investment in systems of production. Such design paradigm not only imposes high break-even points for most car models; they also result in vehicles with extremely low environmental performance and entail serious limitations for increasing recycling rates of non-metallic parts. The characteristics of ecological modernisation in the European automobile industry are used to evaluate whether this phenomenon is conducive to sustainable industrial development. As an implication of this analysis, the concluding chapter presents suggestions for the enhancement of ecological modernisation theory. Fallibility is proposed as both a source of reflection about the appropriation of knowledge and a principle that can be used for the definition of eco-modernising strategies and actions. The acceptance of fallibility as an immanent characteristic of human action is critical for the approximation of the countervailing theories of ecological modernisation and risk society. Finally, if ecological modernisation is expected to facilitate sustainable industrial development, radical technological innovations may be necessary. Such radicalism in technology may need, however, an incremental institutional reform of modern societies. Together, radical technological innovations and incremental institutional reform constitute the concept of radical reformism, which is suggested for enhancement of the ecological modernisation theory, as well as for the development of its normative programmes.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive industry.</field><field name="subject">Sustainability.</field><field name="subject">Industrial ecology.</field><field name="subject">Electric vehicles.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Some aspects of Indonesian patent law in comparison with the Australian Patent Act.</field><field name="creator">Harahap, Isandi</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

In 1988, scientists, environmentalists and politicians from 48 countries endorsed the Toronto Declaration to address global warming that called for a twenty percent worldwide reduction in CO emissions by the year 2005 leading to an eventual fifty percent reduction. Contestation and collaboration in the global climate change public policy process, involving a wide range of actors, has continued since then. Two organisations were founded in 1989 by non-state actors on opposite sides of the climate policy debate. These were the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), which was established by a range of US business interests, and Climate Action Network (CAN) established by a range of environmental and scientific non-governmental organisations. The thesis documents, analyses and compares how each organisation was formed, organised and developed. It reviews how GCC and CAN enabled more effective national and transnational advocacy and how they fostered opposing policy coalitions on climate policy. The respective approaches are assessed, evaluated and contrasted as each sought to gain support for their opposing policy positions in the global climate change policy process. The research uses a neo-Gramscian theoretical perspective and develops and applies an analytical framework focused on policy coalitions of state and non-state actors to investigate the role that non-state actors played in the global climate policy process. GCC and CAN played major roles within opposing policy coalitions that became particularly important in shaping the outcome of the global and national climate policy processes. The thesis focuses on the role of GCC and CAN and their associated policy coalitions in influencing the framing, developing, implementation and review of global climate policy. It examines the global climate change policy process through this analytical lens of contestation between policy coalitions from the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1988 to the first Meeting of the Parties of the ratified Kyoto Protocol in 2005. The thesis assesses the analytical framework and concludes by identifying critical issues that the current global public policy processes have encountered in developing and implementing effective global climate change public policy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climate change.</field><field name="subject">United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change.</field><field name="subject">UNFCCC.</field><field name="subject">Climate policy.</field><field name="subject">Neo-gramscian.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1070</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a language of interactivity through the theory of play.</field><field name="creator">Polaine, Andrew</field><field name="description">In a world increasingly influenced by interactive interfaces, devices and services both in the commercial and non-commercial spheres, understanding interactivity and its underpinnings is essential. We have moved into a state of flux in which both culture and technology are in constant interplay and the only constant is change itself. The only future-proof approach to designing for and dealing with an environment of constant change in these systems and forms is to look for a mechanism and theoretical framework that underpins them all. Drawing upon a range of disciplines &#8211; from design, art, cognitive science, linguistics and more &#8211; this thesis argues that play is such a fundamental building block of culture, society, technology and cognition that it is the ideal lens through which to examine the interactive experience. It is versatile enough to cross boundaries and fundamental enough to be understood intuitively. Through an understanding of the intersection between movement, embodied cognition, metaphor and play, a set of principles of interactivity are developed that are flexible enough to analyse and be applied to a broad spectrum of interactive experiences, from interactive artworks to services to individual user interface elements. Finally, it is proposed that these principles provide a way to examine the phenomenal growth of social networks and the fundamental cultural shifts we are experiencing today as a result of the friction generated between emerging networked technologies and the industrial age structures they are dismantling.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interactivity.</field><field name="subject">Social networks.</field><field name="subject">Play.</field><field name="subject">Interactive art.</field><field name="subject">Media art.</field><field name="subject">Interaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Renovating midwifery care : the complexity of organisational change for midwives in Victoria, Australia</field><field name="creator">Gilmour, Carole</field><field name="description">The importance of the role of the midwife in providing safe, quality care for women has until recently, been underrated in Victoria, Australia. Acknowledgement of the need for midwife-led models of care in state maternity service policies provided opportunities for midwives to become recognised within the healthcare system and the wider community. This professional doctorate aims to examine the ways in which the role of the midwife and her practice has been impacted on by organisational renovations of midwifery care. It identifies the complexity of the factors that affect the midwife&#8217;s ability or choice to work in midwife-led models of care. Furthermore this doctorate highlights the need for ongoing debate into midwifery in Australia. Concepts related to midwifery practice are examined as they form the foundations for the research and policy components of the portfolio. This includes an exploration of midwifery philosophy, the antecedents to autonomous practice and the experience midwives have of midwife-led care. An examination of the concepts of continuity of care and woman-centred care provides a platform upon which to review models of midwifery care. This review highlights the development of an ongoing relationship as a source of satisfaction for midwives and women. The second part of the doctorate reviews policies that guide the provision of maternity services in Victoria. Analysis of these policies using Kingdon&#8217;s multiple streams framework identifies the problems, the political actors and the policy developed, establishing the context for organisational change in maternity care. The antecedents for successful integration of organisational change are explored through a review of change theory and leadership. A case study approach utilised for the research component of the doctorate provides insights into organisational change that occurred at two maternity sites in Victoria. The findings of the study suggest there was a dichotomy between those midwives desiring autonomous practice and wanting to work in midwife-led care and those wishing to remain in one specialised area. Recommendations stemming from these findings include the need for sufficient education and support during change, a review of terminology used to describe midwifery models of care and research into the use of integrated maternity units. Complexity science is examined in order to bring the different strands of the doctorate together, providing an explanation for the different outcomes that occur despite the implementation of similar models. The connective leadership model was suggested as the means to provide leadership that is inclusive of providing direction, mentoring new leaders and providing support and opportunities for midwives to become empowered to practice autonomously. Attention to the complexity of organisational change is vital to ensure the future of midwifery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery.</field><field name="subject">Organizational change.</field><field name="subject">Midwives.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1072</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The water-energy nexus : a comprehensive analysis in the context of New South Wales.</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Debborah</field><field name="description">Water and electricity are fundamentally linked. Policy reforms in both industries, however, do not appear to acknowledge the links nor consider their wider implications. This is clearly unhelpful, particularly as policy makers attempt to develop effective responses to water and energy issues, underpinned by prevailing drought conditions and impending climate change. Against this backdrop, this research has comprehensively analysed the links between water and electricity &#8211; termed water-energy nexus &#8211; in the context of New South Wales. For this purpose, this research has developed an integrated methodological framework. The philosophical guidance for the development of this framework is provided by Integral Theory, and its analytical foundations rest on a suite of research methods including historical analysis, inputoutput analysis, analysis of price elasticities, and long-term scenario analysis. This research suggests that the historical and inextricable links between water and electricity, in the absence of integrated policies, has given rise to water-energy trade-offs. In the electricity industry, water-intensive coal-fired power stations that dominate base-load capacity in the National Electricity Market has resulted in intra- and inter-jurisdictional water sharing tradeoffs. Intermediate and peak demand technologies, suchas gas-fired, cogeneration and renewables, however, would significantly reduce the industry&#8217;s water consumption and carbon emissions. Drought and climate change adaptation responses in the water industry are likely to further increase electricity demand andpotentially contribute to climate change, due to policies that encourage investment in energy-intensive technologies, such as desalination, advanced wastewater treatment and rainwater tanks. Increasing electricity costs due to water shortages and the introduction of emissions trading will futher increase water and electricity prices for end users. Demand management strategies in both industries will assist in curbing price increases, however, their effectiveness is lessened by investment in water- and energy-intensive technologies in both industries. The analysis also demonstrates that strategies to reduce water and electricity consumption of &#8216;other&#8217; production sectors in New South Wales is overwhelmingly dependent on how deeply a particular sector is embedded in the economy, in terms of its contribution to economic output, income generation and employment growth. Regulation, demand management programs, and water pricing policies, for example, that reduce the water and energy intensity of agriculture and key manufacturing sectors are likely to benefit the wider economy and the Environment. The future implications of the water-energy nexus are examined through long-term scenario analysis for New South Wales for 2031. The analysis demonstrates how policy decisions shape the domain for making philosophical choices by society - in terms of the balance between relying on alternative technologies and market arrangements, with differing implications for water and electricity use, and for instigating behavioural change. Based on these findings, this research puts forward a range of recommendations, essentially arguing for reorienting existing institutional arrangements, government measures and industry activities in a way that would encourage integration between the water and energy policies. Although the context of this research is New South Wales, the findings are equally relevant for other Australian states, which share the same national water and energy policy frameworks. Further, the concepts and frameworks developed in this research are also of value to other countries and regions that are faced with the task of designing appropriate policy responses to redress their water and energy challenges.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power consumption.</field><field name="subject">Water-energy nexus.</field><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="subject">Water consumption.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgements during information seeking : policy and research workers' assessments of enough information.</field><field name="creator">Berryman, Jennifer M.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how people determine they have enough information, a fundamental but perplexing question for human information behaviour researchers. Informed by theories of human judgement and decision making, the thesis investigates the ways in which judgements of enough information are made and the subtleties that shape this critical judgement. The empirical work that underpinned the thesis was an exploratory study conducted from an interpretive orientation and using the case study approach. The study examined multiple cases of judgements of enough information made while seeking and using information in the workplace. Semi-structured interviews (33) were conducted with public sector policy and research workers in Australia. Two interviews were carried out, the first with individual participants to explore the nature of the contexts in which they worked and the second, a paired interview with two participants to focus on how they assessed they had enough information. Interviews were taped and transcribed and inductive data analysis carried out. Principal findings included the importance of task in shaping judgements of enough information through an iterative and fluid process. Throughout the process the nature of what constituted enough information changed. Factors in the information use environment of the policy and research workers that shaped their judgements of enough information included the views of colleagues, supervisors and stakeholders, organisational decision making processes and organisational attitudes towards uncertainty. The collaborative information seeking and use of the policy and research workers resulted in collaborative judgements of enough information. The research makes three contributions to the field of human information behaviour research. Firstly findings provide new insights into judgements of enough information made by the policy and research workers, illuminating the judgement of enough information as a process and refining concepts critical to understanding judgements made while seeking and using information. Secondly the study provides a rich description of policy and research workers, a professional group not previously studied in relation to enough information, and their role in the public policy process. Thirdly concern about the limitations of behavioural decision theory to fully explain judgements of enough information led to consideration of naturalistic decision making, a recent development in decision theory. Naturalistic decision making affords a different perspective on human judgement and decision making. As a conceptual framework within which to develop more nuanced understandings of judgements and decision making during information seeking, naturalistic decision making has much to offer human information behaviour researchers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the structural behaviour of the fold-away shelter.</field><field name="creator">Rondero, Thomas Rolan E.</field><field name="description">The F-shelter underwent non-destructive monotonic load tests and destructive shake table test. The timber-framed shear walls with different sheatings; namely wood wool cement boards (wwcb) and F11 structural plywood were tested under uniaxial loading. Furthermore, finite element models (FEM) supplemented the experimental work. An FEM of the corner metal bracket and a 2-dimensional FEM for the timber-framed shear wall were generated and verified from the experimental work.  Behavioural responses from unidirectional lateral loading of the wall were obtained. For the dynamic test, the Kobe earthquake and Zone IV earthquake were simulated to determine the dynamic response of the F-shelter. Excitation was limited to 70% full scale displacement record of Kobe and 80% of Zone IV, due to the 100mm limitation in the allowable displacement on both sides of the shaker table. The shake table test showed that the F-shelter can withstand the simulated earthquakes.  FEMs were developed using ANSYS 7.2, a general finite element software. A requisite input data for the timber-framed shear wall FEM in lieu of a hinge connection corner joint for the timber-framed shear wall were generated through experimental work on the corner metal brackets and verified with the generated FEM. The results of the FEM of the Dipterocarpus grandiflorus Blanco (Apitong) timber-framed sheathed with wwcb were 5% to 9% higher than the average values for maximum deflections and maximum load capacity. The FEM results of the Radiata pine sheathed with F11 plywood, however, were 25% to 14% lower than the average values for maximum deflections and maximum load capacity.  This thesis has demonstrated the process of generating FEMs that can be used as a tool to improve and modify the F-shelter. The structural reliability of design and construction of the first F-shelter prototype was verified from the whole house test and structural modeling of the wall using FEM.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Countertrade and the internationalisation of the Australian firm.</field><field name="creator">Fletcher, Richard</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to broaden our understanding of the nature, causes and consquences of countertrade in the context of the internationalisation of the firm. A comprehensive review and assessment of previous research is presented, including a discussion of how countertrade fits within the context of the various models of the internationalisation process. An analytical framework is presented for studying a number of dimensions of internationalisation (viz forms of international behaviour and international orientation) and possible causes and effects. The forms of internatioalisation invole outward, inward linked forms (such as countertrade).  Based on the literature relating to internationalisation, a number of hypotheses are developed relating various management and firms' characteristics to predisposition to countertrade. These were tested using both bi-variate and multi-variate techniques which involved the use of data generated from a nationwide sample of Australian manufacturing firms. Generally the results of the bi-variate analysis supported the hypothesis showing that the factors which predict outward driven internationalisation also tend to predict countertrade. The analysis involved three measures of internationalisation and four measures of countertrade.   Firms were then grouped according to various measures of predisposition towards countertrade. Using discriminant analysis, these groups of firms were profiled according to factors found to predict countertrade in the bivariate analysis. In order to further explore the relationship between internationalisation and countertrade, firms were also grouped according to their degree of internationalisation and strength of their predisposition towards countertrade. Firms in each group were then profiled using bi-variate and multi-variate analysis. These profiles provide potentially useful classifications of firms as possible bases for targeting and designing government assistance programs.  Finally, three case studies of countertrade transactions by Australian firms were undertaken using the network approach which facilitates a deeper understanding of countertrade in the context of internationalisation. In each case the networks of relationships involved were analysed at both inception and maturity, to further explore how countertrade influenced the internationalisation of the Australian firm. It was found that although the transactions would not have occurred without countertrade, in all cases countertrade led to further international business which in some instances did not require countertrade.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Countertrade.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="subject">Commerce.</field><field name="subject">Internationalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of physical planning policy on household energy use and greenhouse emissions.</field><field name="creator">Rickwood, Peter</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of physical planning policy on combined transport and dwelling-related energy use by households. Separate analyses and reviews are conducted into dwelling-related and transport-related energy use by households, before a model is developed to investigate the city-wide implications of different land-use scenarios in Sydney, Australia. The analysis of household energy use in Chapter 3 suggests that medium density housing (i.e. lose-rise apartments, townhouses, and terraces) is likely to result in the lowest per-capita energy use, while also allowing for sufficient densities to make frequent public transport service viable. The analysis of transport energy in Chapter 4 confirms that increasing urban density is associated with decreased car ownership and use, independent of other factors. However, land use changes alone are likely to result in modest changes to travel behaviour. The results of the scenario modelling in Chapters 7-9 support the view that changes to land use alone can reduce household energy consumption, but the changes, even over a long time period (25 years) are small (~0-10%) for all but the most extreme land-use policies. Instead, a coordinated (land-use/transport and other policy levers) approach is much more effective. The results confirm that it is transport energy that is most sensitive to planning policy, but that a combined consideration of dwelling-related and transport-related energy use is still useful. The micro-simulation model developed to assess the impact of different land-use planning scenarios allows the establishment of a lower-bound estimate of the effect that housing policy has on household energy use, assuming &#8216;business as usual&#8217; transport policy, household behaviour, and technology.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenhouse gas mitigation.</field><field name="subject">Greenhouse emissions.</field><field name="subject">Urban modelling.</field><field name="subject">Urban planning.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of a person-centred approach to care of older people with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour in the acute care setting using action research.</field><field name="creator">Poole, Julia Lorna</field><field name="description">Increasing numbers of older patients with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour are likely to present to acute care hospitals in the future. Nurses are not well disposed towards care due to safety and morale issues caused by knowledge deficits, job stress, oppressed group behaviours and ageist attitudes. Patient outcomes are often poor with multiple adverse events, long lengths of stay and levels of mortality. Disturbed behaviour may be caused by delirium, depression or other mental disorders and dementia or all. The research question addressed was &#8220;Can the instigation of a person-centred approach to care of patients with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour result in decreased nursing stress, improved patient care practices, outcomes and relatives&#8217; satisfaction?&#8221; A conceptual framework incorporating the constructs of Person-Centred Care, the Integrated Structural Model of Human Behaviour and Practice Development informed the action research methods utilised. The processes of facilitation were used to undertake four action research cycles incorporating plans, actions, observations and reflections in one 25-bed acute aged care ward in a large tertiary referral hospital The first cycle involved setting up the study, recruitment of nurses and patients, gathering of baseline data and application of nonparticipant observational studies of the quality of nurse-patient interactions which served to inform the plan for interventions. The following three cycles demonstrated efforts to undertake those interventions through strategies to increase nursing empowerment and knowledge in the context of constant staff turnover and diversions that compromised support and participation. During the study there were few apparent adverse patient outcomes with significant improvements in patient analgesic administration, relatives&#8217; satisfaction with care, nursing care practices involving the completion of a Communication and Care Cues form and nurses&#8217; interactions with the patients. New care planning tools were developed that will enable ongoing activities for practice improvement. Conversely, there was a significant increase in the nurses&#8217; stress levels when caring for hypoactive delirious patients, a trend towards more emotional exhaustion, high nursing turnover and increased sick leave rates. Nursing care practices were unchanged and the new care planning tools were not well utilised. Reflection on the implications and limitations of action research methods supported by practice development strategies in the dynamic, often chaotic environment experienced during the study, suggested that if there is an absence of hierarchical managerial sponsorship for such activities, then sustainable change is difficult. Therefore, it was shown that a person-centred approach to care of patients with cognitive impairment and disturbed behaviour using action research methods in this environment, can result in some enhanced nurse-patient interactions, patient care practices, outcomes and relatives&#8217; satisfaction. However, progress is likely to be slow and time consuming. Further improvements require attention to the well-being status of the nurses through actions that generate feelings of empowerment through individual recognition, knowledge enhancement, adequate access to patient information and sufficient time to undertake their duties as equal members of the multidisciplinary team.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Person centred care.</field><field name="subject">Action research.</field><field name="subject">Cognitive impairment.</field><field name="subject">Older people.</field><field name="subject">Acute care nursing.</field><field name="subject">Dementia.</field><field name="subject">Delirium.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The education of women in England 1650-1750: changes in ideas and pedagogy</field><field name="creator">Scott, Catherine Elizabeth Margaret</field><field name="description">The period 1650 to 1750 in England saw the development of small but positive changes in the education of women and girls.  Increasingly, various writers began to argue that more attention and resources needed to be devoted to the way in which girls were taught. Although the accepted curriculum of religion, various kinds of needlework,  reading, household management, music, dancing, history and French was not seriously questioned, there were attempts  by authors such as Charles Rollin and Archbishop Fenelon of Cambrai to write schemes of study that taught these skills and topics in a more rigorous and interesting manner.  A key development was the entry of women into the discussion, with writers such as Mary Astell and Bathusa Makin arguing for the need of better schools and a richer, more serious curriculum for girls.  As this thesis is focused as much as possible on actual teaching practices as well as shifts in ideology,  changes in the way Primers and Spelling books, which were used by mothers and governesses as aids to teach young children to read  are also examined. Increasingly, there was a recognition of the need for intelligent girls to be stretched and of the danger to the household of badly educated mothers and wives. Female authors expressed their frustration with the limited education offered to girls. This thesis examines a range of authors and texts, including the fictional work of Sarah Fielding, the personal records left by eighteenth- century governess Nelly Weeton and discussions which took place in newspapers such as the Spectator, in order to tease out and illustrate the development of these changes.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">education, England, girls, 1650-1750</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of magnesium metabolism in ruminants : a comparison of sheep and cattle</field><field name="creator">Laporte Uribe, Jos&#233; Alberto</field><field name="description">Transactions of magnesium (Mg) along the gastrointestinal tract and the effect of change in potassium (K) intake were recorded in two in vivo experiments in sheep and cattle. Additional information on the sensitivity to K intake was obtained by comparing Mg transport and electrochemical properties of isolated rumen epithelia of sheep and cattle in 4 additional in vitro experiments.  The experiment described in Chapter 2, and performed in sheep housed indoors in metabolic crates, investigated the compensatory capacity of the intestine to respond to the reduction in Mg absorption from the stomach as a consequence of increase in K intake. The animals were equipped with a ruminal cannula and two intestinal cannulae (duodenum and ileum) and flow of digesta was measured by the addition of two indigestible markers, chromium ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (Cr-EDTA) and ytterbium acetate (Yb). The animals were infused in a Latin square design for periods of 10 days with a solution of K bicarbonate that provided between 15 and 47 g of K/day. The diet consisted of a 50:50 combination of concentrates plus lucerne hay that provided around 3.7 g of Mg per day and 15 g of K per day. After 5 days of infusion samples of feed, faeces, urine and plasma were collected and analysed for Mg and K content. After 6 days of infusion, samples of duodenal and ileal flow were obtained.  The treatments reproduced the detrimental effect of K on Mg absorption, especially in the rumen; a rise in K intake from 15 to 23 g/day reduced total Mg absorption from the gastrointestinal tract from 1.36 to 1.23 g/day, further increase in K intake to 38 and 47 g/day reduced absorption to 1.12 and 1.05 g/day, an overall reduction of around 50% in Mg apparent availability. Magnesium was mainly absorbed in the stomachs and large intestine with the small intestine a site of net secretion. Most of the reduction in Mg absorption with increase in K intake occurred in the stomachs, reducing from 1.86 to 1.11 g/day. A compensatory reduction in the net secretion of Mg from the intestines (small and large) was observed. This compensation was largely due to reduction in net secretion from the small intestine, from 0.85 to 0.22 g/day, rather than an increase in net absorption from the large intestine, although both segments acted synergistically.  Results also suggested significant individual variation in plasma Mg concentration, urinary Mg excretion and in the flow and absorption of Mg along the gastrointestinal tract. It was suggested that most of that variability was due to genetic factors.  Differences between species (cattle and sheep) were pursued during the course of the experiment described in Chapter three. Four triple cannulated rams and 3 triple cannulated dry cows were placed in metabolic crates, fed daily fresh-cut pasture and infused, in a total randomised design that provided the equivalent of an intake of 30,40 and 50 g of K per kg dry matter intake (DMI) per day. Solutions of K (as K bicarbonate) and markers (CrEDT A and Yb acetate) were infused continuously for a period of 10 days; after 5 days of infusion samples of pasture, faeces, urine and plasma were collected and analysed for Mg and K content. After 6 days of infusion, samples of duodenal and ileal flow were obtained. Total feed offered, refusals and water consumption were recorded daily.  Results showed a greater sensitivity of cattle to the increase in K supply. A rise in K supply from 30 to 40 g per kg DMI/day reduced Mg absorption by almost 50% from 0.32 to 0.16 g per kg DMI/day, whereas only the highest treatment dose (50 g of K per kg DMI/day) produced the same deleterious effect in sheep. The absorption of Mg occurred mainly in the stomachs and large intestine; in contrast the small intestine was a site of net secretion in both species. The addition of K slightly reduced the rate of Mg absorption from the rumen, especially in cattle. Similarly, net Mg secretion within the intestines increased with increasing K intake in both species, only to be counterbalanced by a greater Mg absorption from the large intestine. The large intestine in both species (sheep and cattle) reduced faecal losses of Mg but was unable to fully compensate for the reduction in Mg absorption from the stomach or the greater net Mg secretion observed at the small intestine. Differences between species in water content of the faeces were observed to be mainly related to the moisture content of the digesta that reached the ileum rather than a result of differences in absorption in the large intestine.  More evidence of species differences in Mg transport and of sensitivity to K intake were obtained by using isolated rumen epithelia and the Ussing chamber technique. Transport and electrophysiological properties of the tissues were observed in standard conditions and by adding different K concentrations to the mucosal side. Under standard conditions and open-circuit voltage, sheep isolated rumen epithelia had greater transmural potential difference (PDt), and lower conductance (Gt) but similar short-circuit current (Isc) than those from cattle. These results suggested that the rumen epithelium of cattle is leakier than that of sheep. Measurement of the transport of Mg showed that isolated rumen epithelia of cattle transported more Mg and was saturated at higher Mg concentrations (12 vs 4 mM) than sheep epithelia. These differences in Mg influx (transport from mucosa to serosa) were also observed in studies of Mg transport using stable isotopes. Magnesium influx (transport from mucosa to serosa) from the isolated rumen of cattle was greater than in sheep (57.5 &#177; 12.72 vs. 17.3 &#177; 12.72 nmol.cm&#8315;&#178;.h&#8315;&#185;); however this was counterbalanced by a greater Mg efflux (transport from serosa to mucosa) of 48.1 &#177; 12.72 vs. 9.9 &#177; 12.72 nmol.cm&#8315;&#178;.h&#8315;&#185;, for cattle and sheep respectively, when mucosal K concentrations were around 25 mM.  A increase in K concentration on the mucosal side enhanced transmural potential difference (PDt) and short-circuit current (Isc) to a greater extent in sheep than in cattle, suggesting a greater effect of K on sheep than on cattle epithelia. On the other hand, the transport of Mg measured by stable isotopes suggested that net absorption of Mg (7.4 &#177; 12.72 vs. 11.1 &#177; 12.72 nmol.cm&#8315;&#178;.h&#8315;&#185;) in sheep epithelia was similar at 25 and 50 mM of K on the mucosal side, whereas net Mg influx in cattle was largely depressed as a consequence of a reduction in Mg influx (mucosa to serosa) from 57.7 &#177; 12.72 to 2.9 &#177; 12.72 nmol.cm&#8315;&#178; h&#8315;&#185; together with a constant Mg efflux (serosa to mucosa) 48.1 &#177; 12.72 and 41.2 &#177; 12.72 nmol.cm&#8315;&#178;.h&#8315;&#185;, presumably leaving through a paracellular shunt. However, this finding was based on date from a small size and caution should be applied to this conclusion.  In conclusion, data collected from several comparative studies suggest differences in Mg apparent availability between sheep and cattle and also a greater sensitivity of cattle to an increase in K intake. This high sensitivity to K represents a great risk of hypomagnesaemia in dairy cattle in New Zealand where high K concentration is endemic in pastures. Most importantly, these results suggest that models for Mg metabolism in cattle should be based on measurements from cattle nutritional and physiological studies rather than on extrapolation from sheep studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magnesium</field><field name="subject">potassium</field><field name="subject">sheep</field><field name="subject">cattle</field><field name="subject">absorption</field><field name="subject">rumen</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal tract</field><field name="subject">availability</field><field name="subject">070204 - Animal Nutrition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of a validated falls risk assessment for use in clinical practice</field><field name="creator">Tiedemann, Anne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Falls risk factor assessment is the first step in the development of appropriate intervention strategies for the prevention of falls. However, few multifactorial, validated falls risk assessments exist which are suitable for use in busy clinical settings. This project aimed to develop a reliable and valid falls risk assessment that was feasible for use in various clinical settings. The QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment was developed and evaluated via four methods; a) the test-retest reliability of the measures was assessed with 30 community-dwelling older people, b) the concurrent validity of the measures was assessed by comparison with performance in the Physiological Profile Assessment, c) the predictive validity of the measures was assessed by comparison of performance with prospective falls in two studies involving large samples of community dwelling older people and d) the feasibility of the assessment was evaluated with 40 clinicians who trialled the assessment with their patients. The QuickScreen clinical falls risk assessment consists of eight measures, including previous falls, total medications, psychoactive medications, visual acuity, touch sensation, the sit to stand test, the near tandem stand test and the alternate step test. The test-retest reliability of the assessment measures was acceptable (intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.56 to 0.89) and the assessment measures discriminated between multiple fallers and non-multiple fallers with relative risk values ranging from 1.4 to 2.5. The clinicians that trialled the assessment reported that it was quick and easy to administer and that it assisted in the management of their elderly patients. These results show that the QuickScreen Clinical Falls Risk Assessment has proven validity, test-retest reliability and is practical for use in a variety of clinical settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Falls (Accidents) in old age</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/27255</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A software system for radionuclide dosimetry with applications.</field><field name="creator">McKay, Erin, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Radiation dosimetry is necessary for optimising radiation-based medical procedures for individual patients but in the field of nuclear medicine there are few widely available or widely used tools for performing this kind of analysis. Those tools that are available tend to focus on one particular component of the dosimetry problem and integrating tools to form a complete system is left to the end-user.  A software system for performing individual, image-based dosimetry analysis of nuclear medicine studies has been developed and validated. The system consists of a suite of tools that use common file formats and data models. The tools can be integrated to form applications by means of a simple scripting system. One tool is a gamma camera simulator that can produce realistic images of dynamic activity distributions in planar or tomographic formats. Simulated imaging studies produced by this tool are used to validate the other tools in the system. In addition, the system implements a method of simulation assisted quantitation which is shown to achieve high accuracy in both software and physical phantom studies.  The system is applied to the dosimetry of I-131 Lipiodol, a therapeutic agent used to treat primary and secondary cancers of the liver. Simulation studies are used to validate the analytic methods used. Studies of a series of patients, treated over a period 10 years, are retrospectively analysed using a selection of methods appropriate to the available data.  The results of the analysis demonstrated a large range of lung doses from 1 to 10 Gy/GBq administered. The median absorbed dose in liver was 3 Gy (range 1 - 10 Gy) and the median absorbed dose in tumor was 19 Gy (range 5 - 84 Gy). The large individual variation reinforces the necessity of individualised dosimetry for treatment planning and follow up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry.</field><field name="subject">Radioisotope scanning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the nature of postcancer fatigue in women treated for early-stage breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Barbara Kaye, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem investigated Four studies investigated the phenomenon of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in women who had received adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer, with a view to reducing the diagnostic uncertainty surrounding the syndrome and thus facilitating progress in both clinical management and aetiological research. Procedures and results A cross-sectional study of 109 women compared a ???cancer-specific??? self-report questionnaire (FACT-F) (canvassing fatigue symptoms) and a more generic questionnaire (SPHERE) (identifying depression and fatigue). Thirty-seven percent of women reported fatigue. Overall in 20%, fatigue was associated with psychological distress. Seventeen percent of women had fatigue but no depression. A qualitative study utilised focus groups to identify and compare the distinctive features of CRF with those of women with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). A similar set of symptoms was found in both groups, including overwhelming fatigue, un-refreshing sleep and subjective concentration problems. However, women with CFS also reported myalgia and arthralgia. Using the Structured Clinical Interview for Neurasthenia- SCIN, the third study compared the symptoms of three groups of women with fatigue: those with CRF, CFS or major depression. The detailed ???interviewer guide??? provided explicit directions for evaluating and classifying symptoms. This study confirmed the core symptom of ???profound fatigue unrelieved by rest???, and additional features that distinguished between the clinical diagnoses. The fourth study compared features of the evolution of clinically-identified fatigue syndromes in women from two prospective cohort studies; women with post-cancer fatigue (PCF) and women with post-infective fatigue syndrome (PIFS). Major conclusions A syndrome of PCF, present at least six months following adjuvant treatment and unexplained by medical or psychiatric disorder was investigated. The characteristics of PCF and those of CFS are very similar, with the fatigue state having indistinguishable descriptors. Longitudinal evaluation of the symptom complexes of PCF and PIFS suggests divergent pathways may be relevant. Co-morbid features like sleep disturbance; physical deconditioning and mood disturbance may be implicated as factors in the evolution and prolongation of PCF. These studies provide a basis for a more uniform and rigorous classification system - a necessary first step towards advancing the field both in investigating aetiology and new intervention strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Breast -- cancer; Cancer -- adjuvant treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/31202</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainbow holograms</field><field name="creator">Rush, Amy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rainbow holography is the medium I have chosen to specialize in. Holography itself uses light as a sculptural element. In regards to my work, rainbow holography stresses the field of experimentation with the light spectrum until a certain point that I define as travelling the superhighway from reality to virtual worlds. My work appears then as the documentation, in the form of rainbow holograms, of this travel. It depicts narrative imagery while capturing the moments I existed in this virtual world set behind the rainbow.  This project aims to present through still, 3D and filmic imagery the co ??? existence of the physical body and its psychological realm. The psychological reality is articulated as a fictional landscape and the rainbow is used as a metaphor for travel between real and virtual worlds. More importantly, I see holography or rainbow holography as a means of crystallising the vision of the unreachable world behind the rainbow. I see my practice as a new way of using this medium by using this rainbow world as subject matter within the rainbow hologram.  By experimenting with combined image processing techniques within rainbow holography, such as analogue white light transmission holograms, full colour digital stereograms, and dot matrix holograms, it becomes possible to generate a synthetic new world. Here each pixel can have the potential to be every color of the rainbow spectrum simultaneously, depending on the angle of the eye of the perceiver. It is here that my investigation through holographic representation has led me to explore and create other worldly landscapes and to extend reality.  Our longing to travel over the rainbow into our imagination is with us from a very young age. For me this desire has lasted well into adulthood and has somehow found itself at the centre of my creations over the last few years. The childlike and na??ve appearance of my imagery has the ability to evoke the feeling in the viewers of the nostalgia they may have felt as a child, when confronted with the intense experience and wonder of the imaginings of the rainbow. My work trades on a misunderstanding that the medium of holography is taken as a direct representation of an existing reality.  My first hologram I???m a rainbow depicts an alter-egotistical projection of myself as a rainbow princess living in a far away fairytale rainbow galaxy, and communicating with earth beings via the technology of the message contained within the hologram. The hologram has often been associated in science fiction with a message to save the planet. This body of work invites viewers to delve into the depths of their imagination, to save this place where I have travelled by believing in it. As in the story of peter pan where the children are asked to clap their hands if they believe in fairies, by others believing in my imagination they are able to save it.  The world within the imagination holds no fixed place; it is a shifting and dynamic space. This quality is shared with the rainbow, which is similarly ephemeral, vanishing and appearing within the eye of the beholder according to weather patterns. The rainbow hologram is a fixed rainbow. When replayed through the eyes of the viewer, the interaction with the real rainbow is recalled, and the viewer enters into the imagination to perceive the work.  Throughout this paper I have referred to concepts and techniques in other fields such as physics, anthropology, art history and theory. My research is by no means intended as primarily a technical examination of the medium of rainbow holography. The holographic environments I have made rearrange elements from the real world with fictitious realities. They make people feel as if they are viewing a world that is real, but which imitates unreal ideas. These holographic environments enable viewers to experience ideas as a real place.  As Rainbow holography is a relatively new medium, and as my own work uses the rainbow as a multi-layered tool I feel it necessary to investigate the appearance of the rainbow in nature and the reaction of humans to the rainbow as a mythical component in ancient cultures. I am interested in investigating how the rainbow has been used a metaphor for travelling from a material world to ???other worlds??? through its presence in various imaging processes through specific art works. The different ways the rainbow has been used have enabled me to more accurately understand my own work as being a nexus between depicting and generating rainbows. Furthermore, in the discussion of the application of rainbow holography I can show that my own work is necessarily different because of the way I am depicting a rainbow to explore undiscovered territory in which I am the author. Finally I look at how holography is perceived by the public, which helps me to explain the way in which my own work is perceived. Deliberately using the idea of an image in its surrounding context has helped to achieve my desired outcome: to make people believe that the world behind the rainbow really does exist and that I have travelled there, and that they too can do so via viewing my work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rainbow.</field><field name="subject">Art and holography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersion of two dimensional coflowing jet in the intermediate field</field><field name="creator">Guo, Hong Wei, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">An analytical dispersion model has been derived to determine the distribution of velocities and concentrations of a tracer in a two-dimensional jet in a coflowing ambient fluid. The particular novelty of this model is that it bridges the gap between near-field (where initial momentum dominates behaviour) and far-field (where ambient turbulence is more important) domains. We describe this domain as the ???intermediate field???. In a literature review of coflowing jets we find several laboratory studies and models which can predict the velocities (and in some cases concentrations) in a 2D jet, however they all have shortcomings. None could fully account for ambient turbulence, and all were strictly near-field, i.e. they are unable to describe behaviour when ambient turbulence dominates the initial shear. A brief review of analytical far-field models was also undertaken. There are standard solutions for the dispersion of a 2D continuous source but none that allow for an initial source momentum or non-uniform velocity. As opposed to the near-field coflow approach used by other researchers we start from the far-field, modifying the simple diffusion models by perturbing the governing equations to allow for the initial momentum. Models are developed for both along-stream velocity and the concentration field of a tracer. From the velocity model, a comparison is made with experimental data available from one researcher (Wang, 1996) and an existing near-field coflow model PJCMERG (Davidson, 1989). The initial conditions (width and excess velocity) for our model are determined by Gaussian curve fitting to an arbitrary point in the near-field. The diffusivity parameter is used to adjust (tune) the model until the centreline velocity profile matches. We can always achieve this match and to a much closer degree than PJCMERG. There are no available laboratory or field data for concentrations of a tracer in a 2D coflowing jet although the near-field model PJCMERG does have a tracer component. We demonstrate how PJCMERG cannot converge to any far-field model, while our model provides a neat transition between the near-field and far-field. We have started the extension of the 2D model to the more common 3D situation although we have yet to carry out any comparisons with other models or data. The model development is included in an appendix for other researchers to pick up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">two-dimensional jet</field><field name="subject">2D jet</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">far-field model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty, gender &amp; community development: The lived experiences of slum-dwelling women in Nairobi</field><field name="creator">Muli, Chrisanta Kanini, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores poverty and community development in the slums of Nairobi. It theorises on the nature of slum-dwelling women's lived experiences of poverty within a patriarchal society, and highlights not only their lack of financial capacity to address household needs, but also their lack of capabilities in terms of social and economic rights. The study provides identification and analysis of the significant role that slum-dwelling women play in community development initiatives. It proposes that these women??s individual and collective experiences of poverty, within Kenyan patriarchal society, are the fundamental motivation for them to engage in community development within their communities.  Critical concepts and theories driving the study are poverty, gender and community development, contextualised within the Kenyan state and society. A qualitative methodology was used, employing a participatory action research framework. A number of qualitative methods were applied: focus groups, semi-structured in-depth individual interviews, and documentary analysis. Women from three women??s groups based in Nairobi slums participated and were co-researchers. Guided by the ??voices?? of slum-dwelling women, this thesis changed its original orientation concerning the use of information technology to an exploration of slum-dwelling women??s lived experiences of poverty. It is argued that these experiences catapulted the women into ??home-grown?? community development initiatives. Their lack of 'access' to fundamental resources and services is attributed, in large part, to the neo-colonial and patriarchal nature of Kenyan society that has perpetuated and compounded gender biases and inequality. This study identifies a disconnection between formal definitions of poverty and any resulting ??imposed?? community development initiatives, and the women??s analyses of their own priorities and needs. The women??s multi-level and intersectorial understanding of poverty, and their ??home-grown?? community development initiatives offer a finely contextualised, responsive and capacity-building alternative approach to addressing the reality of their poverty. This thesis proposes that for slum-dwelling women in Nairobi to benefit from community development, such development must be based upon their contextualised, class- and gender-framed definitions of poverty. This can be understood as the next generation of community development that is neither imposed nor externally managed, but emerges from the people, in this case the women in the slums of Nairobi who are experiencing the poverty. This emerging community development is generated from and by the women??s analyses of the disconnection, corruption and failure of current development approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new evolutionary optimisation method for the operation of power systems with multiple storage resources</field><field name="creator">Thai, Cau Doan Hoang, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Advanced technologies, a world-wide trend to deregulation of power systems and environmental constraints have attracted increasing interest in the operation of electric power systems with multiple storage resources. Under the competitive pressure of the deregulation, new efficient solution techniques to adapt quickly to the changing marketplace are in demand. This thesis presents a new evolutionary method, Constructive Evolutionary Programming (CEP), for minimising the system operational cost of scheduling electric power systems with multiple storage resources. The method combines the advantages of Constructive Dynamic Programming and Evolutionary Programming. Instead of evolving the "primal" variables such as storage content releases and thermal generator outputs, CEP evolves the piecewise linear convex cost-to-go functions (i.e. the storage content value curves). The multi-stage problem of multi-storage power system scheduling is thus decomposed into many smaller one-stage subproblems with evolved cost-to-go functions. For each evolutionary individual, linear programming is used in the forward pass process to solve the dispatch subproblems and the total system operational cost over the scheduling period is assigned to its fitness. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed method is robust and efficient for multi-storage power systems, particularly large complex hydrothermal system with cascaded and pumped storages. Although the proposed method is in the early stage of development, relying on assumptions of piecewise linear convexity in a deterministic environment, methods for the incorporation of stochastic models, electrical network and nonlinear, non-convex and non-smooth models are discussed. In addition, a number of possible improvements are also outlined. Due to its simplicity but robustness and efficiency, there are potential research directions for the further development of this evolutionary optimisation method.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary programming Computer science</field><field name="subject">Dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems Management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting the citation impact of clinical neurology journals using structural equation modeling with partial least squares</field><field name="creator">Yue, Weiping, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ongoing debate on the evaluative role of citation analysis and the theory of citation recognizes that the citation process is complex and that citation counts are affected by certain extra-scientific or external factors. To date, little effort has been made to explore the effects of various external factors; this thesis addresses this lack. In the context of the various perspectives on citations and citation analysis, this study uses journals as the unit of analysis and investigates what, how, and to what extent extra-scientific factors influence the citation impact of journals. An integrated conceptual model of Journal Citation Impact that takes into account current theoretical positions and prior empirical research findings is developed. It addresses the interrelationships between Journal Citation Impact and a range of external factors (Journal Properties, Journal Visibility, Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, Journal Selectivity, Journal Promptness, Journal Editorial Prestige, and Perceived Journal Quality). The proposed conceptual model is novel in that it: (1) incorporates nearly all possible external factors that affect Journal Citation Impact; (2) addresses the complex interrelationships between a number of external factors and Journal Citation Impact in one model; (3) regards both Journal Citation Impact and its external factors as theoretical constructs; and (4) identifies the observed variables of the external factors and Journal Citation Impact. However, because of the difficulties in operationalizing all the theoretical constructs, this conceptual model is simplified to an operational model for empirical testing. The operational model includes the construct Journal Citation Impact and four of its external factors, Journal Properties, Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, and Perceived Journal Quality. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with Partial Least Squares (PLS) is used to test the operational model with empirical data from 41 research journals in clinical neurology. Data are collected from bibliographic database searching, web searching, printed journals, and from a web-based survey that was conducted to obtain information on perceptions of journal quality. Empirical results of the operational model show that Journal Accessibility, Journal Internationality, and Perceived Journal Quality have large, medium, and small effects respectively on Journal Citation Impact, thus indicating that certain extra-scientific factors can influence Journal Citation Impact significantly. The findings suggest that great care should be taken in interpreting and evaluating the results obtained from citation analysis. In terms of Journal Citation Impact, this research also suggests that various journal citation indicators should be ii used to reflect different aspects of citation impact. By exploring the phenomenological domain in the citing process, this exploratory study not only provides a better understanding of citation analysis, it also contributes to the development of the theory of citation. From the methodological perspective, introducing SEM with PLS to Informetrics and Scientometrics also contributes to the knowledge base of these fields. Pragmatically, the research findings will enhance the judgment of researchers and practitioners such as editors, publishers, librarians and other information specialists in assessing journal performance. Finally, the worldwide survey findings on peer assessment of journal outlets in clinical neurology will be useful for researchers, academics or clinicians in this field.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bibliographical citations</field><field name="subject">Multivariate analysis</field><field name="subject">Medicine</field><field name="subject">Periodicals.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of bone defect models in immunodeficient animals</field><field name="creator">Gan, Jade Ho Yue, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bone defects resulting from non-unions, fractures, significant revision joint replacements, tumour resection and osteolysis present a clinical problem. While autografts are considered the gold standard, ubiquitous use of this reparative technique is limited by graft supply and site morbidity. Recent progresses in tissue engineering using stem cells, bone enhancing molecules and gene therapy have provided more hypotheses for bone defect treatment. In vivo assessment to test these hypotheses requires animal models to mimic human conditions. Immunodeficient or nude animals have the advantage of hosting materials from human and other xenographic origins without immuno-intolerance or rejection. A thorough understanding of the biology in nude animals is vital for the further advancement of connective tissue healing and regeneration strategies. Nude mice are excellent xenographic hosts for in- vivo characterisation and provide a reproducible animal source. The immune deficiencies of nude compared to normal animals may however, influence bone healing and need to be addressed. This dissertation (a) investigated potential bone defect models in nude mice and nude rats (b) incorporated the selected bone defect model to evaluate the effect of T cell deficiency and age on bone defect healing in nude animals (c) determined the feasibility of a critical size defect (CSD) in nude mice. A distal-femur-condylar-defect (DFCD) model was successfully performed in nude mice and rats. The model was found to have some advantages as a bone defect model: (1) located at a weight-bearing skeletal site (2) no requirements for an internal or external fixator (3) does not obstruct or limit mobility (4) location is not in close proximity to any major organs such as the brain (5) easy identification of surface anatomy (6) defect size is standardised and reproducible (7) does not require lengthy and complicated surgery and (8) cost effective. This dissertation confirmed that bone healing in nude mice is similar to that of normal immunocompetent mice. Absence of T lymphocytes did not delay or inhibit bone repair. Use of older nude mice did not seem to affect the healing rate, in contrast to older normal mice, which showed delay in bone healing in the initial phase. Establishment of critical sized defects in mice at a weight-bearing location was not feasible due to the robust healing of murine. This dissertation recommends that the DFCD model could be utilized for the assessment of xenogenic materials at early time point.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bone-grafting</field><field name="subject">immunology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion. The findings from this thesis provide insights on tacit collusion in an oligopoly and policy implications from a learning perspective. With modelling flexibility, our co-evolutionary approach can be extended to study strategic behaviour in an oligopoly considering many other market characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Price fixing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Finance -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Oligopolies -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving mobile IP handover latency on end-to -end TCP in UMTS/WCDMA networks</field><field name="creator">Lau, Chee Kong, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to terminal mobility and change of service area, efficient IP mobility support is an important aspect in UMTS networks in order to provide mobile users negligible packet loss rate and low handover latency, and thus some level of guaranteed quality-ofservice (QoS) to support real-time applications. 3G/UMTS has been specified and implemented as an end-to-end mobile communications system. The underlying WCDMA access systems manage radio access handover (layer 1) and provide linklayer mobility (layer 2) in terms of connection setup and resource management. For the UMTS nodes to have seamless connectivity with the Internet, the UMTS core networks need to be able to support continuous and no network service session handover (layer 3 and above). A long IP handover latency results in high packet loss rate and severely degrades its end-to-end transport level performance. Network-layer handover latency has therefore been regarded as one of the fundamental limitations in IP-based UMTS networks. Therefore, it is crucial to provide efficient network-layer mobility management in UMTS/WCDMA networks for seamless end-to-end TCP connection with the global Internet.  Mobility of UMTS nodes necessitates extra functionalities such as user location tracking, address registration and handover related mechanisms. The challenge to provide seamless mobility in UMTS requires localised location management and efficient IP handover management. Mobile IPv6 protocol offers a better mobility support as the extended IPv6 features with mobility mechanism are integrated to the mobile nodes. To mitigate the effect of lengthy IP handover latency, two well-known handover reducing mechanisms based on Mobile IPv6 support have been proposed in the literature. They are designed with hierarchical network management and address pre-configuration mechanism. Hierarchical management aims to reduce the network registration time, and fast-handover attempts to minimise the address resolution delay. S-MIP (Seamless Mobile IP) integrates the key benefits of the above IP mobility mechanisms coupled with local retransmission scheme to achieve packet lossless and extremely low handover latency, operating in WLAN environments.  In this thesis, we explore the possible Mobile IP solutions and various IP handover optimisation schemes in IPv6 to provide seamless mobility in UMTS with the global Internet. It aims at developing an optimised handover scheme that encompasses the packet lossless and extremely low handover latency scheme in S-MIP, and applying it into the UMTS/WCDMA packet data domain. Therefore, the hybrid UMTS-SMIP architecture is able to meet the requirements of delay sensitive real-time applications requiring strict delay bound, packet lossless and low handover latency performance for end-to-end TCP connection during a UMTS IP-based handover. The overall seamless handover architecture in UMTS facilitates integrated, scalable and flexible global IP handover solution enabling new services, assuring service quality and meeting the user???s expectations in future all-IP UMTS deployment. The viability of the seamless mobility scheme in UMTS is reflected through and validated in our design model, network protocol implementation, and service architecture. We illustrate the performance gained in QoS parameters, as a result of converged UMTS-SMIP framework compared to other Mobile IPv6 variants. The simulation results show such a viable and promising seamless handover scheme in UMTS on IP handover latency reduction on its end-to-end TCP connection.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile IPv6; Seamless Mobility; IP Handover; UMTS/WCDMA.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for sustainable building tools</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yu, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sustainable building (SB) tools have been recognized and explored in different regions as among the most effective means to encourage, regulate and assist SB development. A large variety of SB tools have been developed and applied in the marketplace, while a number of new tools emerge each year. While the early-developed SB tools provide general references and resources, it is still not easy either to select from existing tools, to develop new tools, or to customize existing tools for any specific region. On the one hand, the quickly expanding number of tools is developed with different styles, contents, functions, underlying assumptions as well as limitations relating to the specific conditions in their origin regions. Without a comprehensive framework to classify the tools, it is difficult to select the right ones out for any specific task in hand. On the other hand, the conditions and requirements for developing SB tools in a specific region are multi-faceted and complex. Without a proper understanding of them from a holistic point of view, it is difficult to say which tools or which type of tools are indeed needed and appropriate in a region. Recognizing the demand for developing and applying specific SB tools in different regions and the confusion surrounding existing tools, this research establishes two comprehensive conceptual frameworks to classify SB tools and SB issues. The framework for SB tools includes four related categories that focus on building stakeholders, building activities, buildings, and building performances. The framework for SB issues constitutes two combined hierarchy structures each for the performance (P) factors and the decision-making (D) factors respectively. These two frameworks not only serve as guides toward identifying the types of tools (existing or not) that are needed and suitable in a specific region, but also facilitate the selection and customization of existing tools for specific regions.  Guided by the two generic frameworks established in the research, China specific conditions and requirements for SB tools are investigated. China specific SB issues are first identified from three preliminary SB tools in the country and classified according to the generic frameworks for SB issues. A questionnaire survey targeting local architects is then conducted in four selected cities. Answers in the replied questionnaires are analysed with the SPSS software and the Content Analysis method. Local architects??? perception about the relative importance of SB issues and their preferences and expectation about the characters, orientations, functions and styles of SB tools are identified and compared with that in existing SB tools. Accordingly, similarities and contradictions between existing tools and local architects??? perceptions, preferences, and expectations regarding China specific SB tools are summarized and discussed. Synthesizing the above research and investigation about the generic and regionally specific aspects of SB tools, this thesis finally proposes a holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools. First, a more balanced approach for developing SB tools in both the broad and narrow senses is proposed and discussed; second, a suite approach for developing SB tools in both the functional and spatial dimensions is proposed and discussed. Conceptual frameworks are established in the discussions; examples are provided to illustrate the concepts; and recommendations are made for further development of the generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools in China.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable buildings</field><field name="subject">sustainable architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pilot reliability and validity of the stroke rehabilitation motivation scale</field><field name="creator">White, Gregory Nicholas, Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aims  This study aimed to demonstrate reliability and validity of the Stroke Rehabilitation Motivation Scale, a novel instrument designed to assess internal and external contributions to motivation. Many studies recognise motivation, in the everyday sense, as a factor affecting stroke rehabilitation, but there is no standard measure. There is also no agreement as to whether motivation in the post-stroke period is the same as the absence of depression, anxiety or stress; hence the need for an independent measure of motivation.  Method  The Stroke Rehabilitation Motivation Scale was adapted from the 28-item Sports Motivation Scale, which in turn was developed according to the intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to motivation identified by Self-Determination Theory.  The resulting Stroke Rehabilitation Motivation Scale was tested in two stages. In the 28-item reliability stage, in a sample of 18 stroke patients from the stroke ward of Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital, the scale was tested for Inter-rater reliability, scale reliability, and validity via comparison of high vs. low motivation groups according to a novel ???motivation score???. The scale was shortened from 28-items (four per subscale) to 7 items (one per subscale) by selecting the most reliable items.  The three intrinsic and extrinsic subscales were summed and averaged, and the amotivation score was subtracted from this to produce a ???motivation score???, such that a person with a positive score had more motivation, either extrinsic or intrinsic, than they had amotivation.  e.g.	[ ( E + I )/2 ??? A ]  In the 7-item reliability stage, a further 13 patients were recruited from Bankstown-Lidcombe and Liverpool Hospitals. The 7-item scale was tested for scale reliability, and for validity by comparison of high vs. low motivation groups as well as correlations between motivation score, anxiety, depression and stress, and rehabilitation outcomes.  Results  In both the 28-item and 7-item stages the scale demonstrated adequate to very good reliability. There was a lack of significant mean differences or correlations to demonstrate validity in either stage; this study does not represent a convincing demonstration of validity of the SRMS. However, it would appear that motivation is conceptually distinct from depression, anxiety and stress, and the scale definitely warrants further testing in a larger sample.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Stroke</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of the human cytochrome P450 2J2 gene by activator protein-1</field><field name="creator">Marden, Nicole Yvonne, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes catalyses the oxidative metabolism of lipophilic xenobiotics such as drugs and environmental chemicals, and also plays an essential role in the biosynthesis and metabolism of endogenous compounds such as cholesterol and bile acids, vitamins, steroids, arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2) is a recently identified member of the human CYP protein family that is highly expressed in the heart, vasculature, liver and other tissues. CYP2J2 metabolises arachidonic acid (AA) into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have a number of potent biological activities including cytoprotective, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Given its widespread tissue distribution and the biological actions of EETs, CYP2J2 is likely to play an important role in cellular physiology, and altered expression of CYP2J2 may have pathophysiological consequences. Indeed, recent literature studies have indicated that CYP2J2 protein levels are decreased in vascular endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and that maintenance of CYP2J2 expression enhances cell survival. Thus, CYP2J2 expression may be impaired in diseases or conditions associated with decreased oxygen availability, such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke and atherosclerosis, and this may contribute to their pathogenic consequences. Despite its likely importance in human physiology and pathophysiology, very little is known about the regulation of CYP2J2 gene expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control expression of the CYP2J2 gene. In particular, this study was designed to identify factors that regulate the expression of the CYP2J2 gene in the liver-derived HepG2 cell line during normoxia and hypoxia. A 2.4 kb fragment of the 5???-flanking region of the CYP2J2 gene (corresponding to nucleotides -2341 to +98, relative to the translation start site) was isolated from a human genomic library. Automated searching of the upstream regulatory region of CYP2J2 identified several putative binding sites for the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Because AP-1 activity is altered in hypoxia, the possibility that AP-1 may participate in the regulation of CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia was explored. Cell culture studies examined the relationship between the expression of CYP2J2, and the  AP-1 genes c-fos and c-jun, in HepG2 cells cultured in normoxia and hypoxia. Down-regulation of CYP2J2 mRNA and protein in hypoxic HepG2 cells was associated with the pronounced up-regulation of c-Fos protein from an undetectable level in normoxic cells; c-Jun protein levels were readily detectable in normoxia, and were also increased in hypoxia. Transient transfection studies revealed distinct effects of Fos and Jun proteins on CYP2J2 promoter activity. While the CYP2J2 promoter was strongly activated by c-Jun, c-Fos was inactive, and also abolished gene transactivation elicited by c-Jun. These results suggest that the constitutively expressed c-Jun is important in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia stimulates the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which do not support CYP2J2 transcription, leading to gene down-regulation. Experiments with CYP2J2 promoter deletion constructs revealed that the region between -152 to -50 bp relative to the translation start site was crucial for activation of CYP2J2 by c-Jun. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transfection studies identified two distinct elements within this region that were involved in c-Jun-dependent transactivation: an AP-1-like element at -56 to -63 bp, and an atypical AP-1 element at -105 to -95 bp. c-Jun homodimers interacted specifically with both elements. Separate mutagenesis of either element significantly impaired c-Jun-dependent transactivation of CYP2J2, while mutagenesis of both elements eliminated c-Jun-responsiveness. EMSAs established that c-Jun, but not c-Fos, interacted with both elements in normoxic HepG2 cells. Furthermore, mutagenesis of either c-Jun-response element significantly decreased the basal transcriptional activity of the CYP2J2 promoter in HepG2 cells, while mutagenesis of both elements almost completely suppressed basal promoter activity. These findings indicate a pivotal role for c-Jun in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. Transfection studies indicated that c-Fos suppresses c-Jun-dependent activation of CYP2J2 at both the -56/-63 bp and -105/-95 bp c-Jun-response elements. However, c-Fos-dependent inhibition appears to be mediated by distinct mechanisms at these two regulatory elements. While both elements interacted with c-Jun homodimers, only the -105/-95 bp element was able to interact with c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers. Thus, the up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia, and the shift from c-Jun homodimers to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, directly decreased c-Jun binding and transactivation at the -56/-63 bp element. In contrast, up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia altered the composition of proteins bound at the -105/-95 bp element from c-Jun to c-Fos/c-Jun. Inhibition of promoter activity occurs because c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers can occupy, but not transactivate, the CYP2J2 promoter via the -105/-95 bp element.  In summary, this thesis provides novel information on the molecular mechanisms that control the differential expression of the human CYP2J2 gene in normoxia and hypoxia. In particular, this study has established that the AP-1 proteins c-Jun and c-Fos play a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter in response to cellular stress. Binding of c-Jun to two distinct c-Jun-response elements within the CYP2J2 proximal promoter induces transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 gene and is essential for maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia promotes the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which inhibit transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter by c-Jun, thus contributing to decreased CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia. Impaired expression of CYP2J2 may contribute to cellular injury in diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for mediating altered CYP2J2 expression may eventually lead to therapeutic strategies that manipulate the expression of this important human gene.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">genetic transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene studies in epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Matthew W, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited blistering diseases that share the common feature of blister formation subsequent to normal mechanical insult of the epidermis. Despite two decades of investigation at both epidemiological and genetic levels, there remains much yet to be uncovered about the pathophysiology of this disease. This research had dual aims. Firstly, by enrolling patients in Australia and New Zealand with the simplex type of EB (EBS) in a screening programme in conjunction with a highly detailed review of the EB and intermediate filament literatures, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype in EBS. Secondly, we attempted to evaluate the use of baculoviral vectors as a means of introducing the type VII collagen cDNA into human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Among the EBS patients screened we identified a novel multi residue deletion in keratin 5 which led to a surprisingly mild form of epidermolysis bullosa Dowling ??? Meara. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of epidermal tissue from the affected individual showed that the mutant transcript was present at levels 2.7 fold higher than the wild type transcript. We demonstrated a family in which the presence of a previously reported keratin 14 mutation A413T appeared to induce disease expression in only one of the three individuals found to carry the mutations. We also identified two EBS families with no mutations in either keratin 5 or keratin 14. This is the first study to analyse EB patients from New Zealand and the first to report the presence of a deletion mutation in the 2B domain of keratin 5. The results of our type VII collagen transfer work showed that baculoviruses can be engineered to contain insert sequences in excess of 10kb and are able to gain entry to both human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Electron microscopy and analyses of the baculoviral vectors showed that the lack of protein expression subsequent to infection of human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes is likely due to the inability of the vector to escape cytoplasmic endosomes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="subject">genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic analysis of consumer buyer behaviour in urban China</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Simon, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has experienced rapid economic growth and is now arguably the world???s largest consumer market. However, despite the size and potential of the Chinese market, there is a serious lack of formal understanding of Chinese buyer behaviour. The broad aim of this research is to understand patterns of buyer behaviour through a systematic analysis of the purchasing of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) by urban Chinese consumers. Several specific research questions are addressed: ??? What patterns of brand purchasing and brand loyalty do urban Chinese consumers exhibit? ??? Do these patterns generalise across content, spatial and temporal dimensions? ??? Are there any systematic significant bases of segmentation within the FMCG markets that are studied? ??? What key implications are to be drawn by academics and practitioners? ??? More generally, what is the value of adopting a systematic approach to research in this area of enquiry? ??? Also, what is the value of applying and extending models developed in the West to the Chinese consumer context? The research is divided into two main studies. The first involves secondary consumer panel data and focuses on brand purchasing and loyalty behaviour. Analysis is conducted using the Dirichlet model, which provides theoretical predictions for a range of brand performance measures. The second study involves primary consumer panel data and  examines potential bases of segmentation. Analysis is based on the Generalised Dirichlet Model, which enables the impact of covariates on buyer behaviour to be assessed. It is found that the patterns of Chinese buyer behaviour for FMCGs are generally similar to those in the West. Results unique to the Chinese market are also identified. Importantly, the results and patterns generalise across all dimensions of analysis (that is, for brands within product categories, store types and store chains, and in different regions and cities, and in different time periods). Also, there is a lack of consumer segmentation among directly competing brands within the product categories that are studied. The findings not only make a strong empirical contribution but also have important academic and managerial implications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer behavior.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOBMAS - A methodology for ontology-based multi-agent systems development</field><field name="creator">Tran, Quynh Nhu, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Agent-based systems are one of the most vibrant and important areas of research and development to have emerged in information technology in the 1990s??? (Luck et al. 2003). The use of agents as a metaphor for designing and constructing software systems represents an innovative movement in the field of software engineering: ???Agent- Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)??? (Lind 2000; Luck et al. 2003). This research contributes to the evolution of AOSE by proposing a comprehensive ontology-based methodology for the analysis and design of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The methodology is named MOBMAS, which stands for ???Methodology for Ontology-Based MASs???. A major improvement of MOBMAS over the existing agentoriented MAS development methodologies is its explicit and extensive support for ontology-based MAS development. Ontologies have been widely acknowledged for their significant benefits to interoperability, reusability, MAS development activities (such as system analysis and agent knowledge modelling) and MAS operation (such as agent communication and reasoning). Recognising these desirable ontology???s benefits, MOBMAS endeavours to identify and implement the various ways in which ontologies can be used in the MAS development process and integrated into the MAS model definitions. In so doing, MOBMAS has exploited ontologies to enhance its MAS development process and MAS development product with various strengths. These strengths include those ontology???s benefits listed above, and those additional benefits uncovered by MOBMAS, e.g. support for verification and validation, extendibility, maintainability and reliability. Compared to the numerous existing agent-oriented methodologies, MOBMAS is the first that explicitly and extensively investigates the diverse potential advantages of ontologies in MAS development, and which is able to implement these potential advantages via an ontology-based MAS development process and a set of ontology-based MAS model definitions. Another major contribution of MOBMAS to the field of AOSE is its ability to address all key concerns of MAS development in one methodological framework. The methodology provides support for a comprehensive list of methodological requirements,  which are important to agent-oriented analysis and design, but which may not be wellsupported by the current methodologies. These methodological requirements were identified and validated by this research from three sources: the existing agent-oriented methodologies, the existing evaluation frameworks for agent-oriented methodologies and conventional system development methodologies, and a survey of practitioners and researchers in the field of AOSE. MOBMAS supports the identified methodological requirements by combining the strengths of the existing agent-oriented methodologies (i.e. by reusing and enhancing the various strong techniques and model definitions of the existing methodologies where appropriate), and by proposing new techniques and model definitions where necessary. The process of developing MOBMAS consisted of three sequential research activities. The first activity identified and validated a list of methodological requirements for an Agent Oriented Software Engineering methodology as mentioned above. The second research activity developed MOBMAS by specifying a development process, a set of techniques and a set of model definitions for supporting the identified methodological requirements. The final research activity evaluated and refined MOBMAS by collecting expert reviews on the methodology, using the methodology on an application and conducting a feature analysis of the methodology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent agents (Computer software)</field><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Restoration strategies and algorithms for survivable networks</field><field name="creator">Lau, Cheuk Wan William, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes new algorithms for restoration strategies that provision bandwidth guaranteed recovery for unicast and multicast connections. The primary focus is on online restoration strategies that sequentially do pre-planning of resource for each request using the current network resource state. Online restoration strategies do not require prior knowledge of all the requests like that of offline restoration strategies. Therefore, online restoration strategies are more suitable for on-demand and dynamic traffic engineering control. The proposed new algorithms are compared to known algorithms from literature. Most literature evaluates the performance of the algorithms with two metrics only: total bandwidth requirement and the number of requests accepted in the network. This thesis evaluates the algorithms in one additional dimension: the computational time. This is an important criterion when response times for establishing new connections are stringent. Each algorithm makes trade-off between computational complexity, bandwidth efficiency, and number of accepted requests. Results show that the proposed algorithms provide alternative trade-offs between the three performance metrics when compared to other existing algorithms. The alternatives provide more choice for the network providers and the best algorithm to use depends on the network's requirements. The restoration strategies used for unicast and multicast connections in this thesis are very compatible thus it is possible to integrate the restoration strategies into a single system where they share the same backup resources. Results from simulations show that using an integrated restoration model has significant benefits, which includes lower backup bandwidth requirement than the separate restoration model.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer networks</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">security measures</field><field name="subject">algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control and state estimation via limited capacity communication networks</field><field name="creator">Malyavej, Veerachai, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Telecommunication networks become major parts in modern complex control systems recently. They provide many advantages over conventional point-to-point connections, such as the simplification on installation and maintenance with comparatively low cost and the nature requirement of wireless communication in remote control systems. In practice, limited resource networks are shared by multiple controllers, sensors and actuators, and they may need to serve some other information unrelated to control purpose. Consequently, the control system design in networked control systems should be revised by taking communication constraints, for example, finite precision data, time delay and noise in transmission, into account. This thesis studies the robust control and state estimation of uncertain systems, when feedback information is sent via limited capacity communication channels. It focuses on the problem of finite precision data due to the communication constraints. The proposed schemes are based on the robust set-valued state estimation and the optimal control techniques.  A state estimation problem of linear uncertain system is studied first. In this problem, we propose an algorithm called coder-decoder for uncertain systems. The coder encodes the observed output into a finite-length codeword and sends it to the decoder that generates the estimated state based on the received codeword. As an illustration, we apply the results in state estimation problem to a precision missile guidance problem using sensor fusion. In this problem, the information obtained from remote sensors is transmitted through limited capacity communication networks to the guided missile. Next, we study a stabilization problem of linear uncertain systems with state feedback. In this problem, the coder-controller scheme is developed to asymptotically stabilize the uncertain systems via limited capacity communication channels. The coder encodes the full state variable into a finite-length codeword and sends it to the controller that drives the system state to the origin. To achieve the asymptotic stability, we use a dynamic quantizer so that quantization noise converges to zero.  The results in both state estimation and stabilization problems can handle the problem of finite data rate communication networks in control systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust control</field><field name="subject">Estimation theory</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Study of Work-Life Balance in Franchised and Independently Owned Small Business Models</field><field name="creator">Young, Robyn</field><field name="description">Work-life balance is a concept that has attracted attention for several years. It is relevant as people attempt to apportion time to different demands they face from both work and life. The multiplicity of demands that individuals have can increase this challenge as people strive to incorporate many more activities into lives. The focus of current literature regarding work-life balance tends to focus on how employees can be provided with opportunities by their organisations for achieving this elusive balance. Research has been conducted into various strategies that organisations have implemented to facilitate their employees&#146; lifestyle options. Furthermore, studies have examined the role of organisational initiatives and staff retention. However, many of the organisations providing these opportunities for employees have substantial resources, thereby enabling the provision of these initiatives. Previous empirical research has examined work-life balance in depth. However, there are aspects that call for further attention. In particular, the management of this concept within small business requires further research. Australia has a large number of small businesses, which comprise a large proportion of the labour force and contribute significantly the national economy. The broad category of small business includes different business models, and two of these models are the independent and the franchised business. The success of these models has been demonstrated by their rapid growth in the Australian economy. As one of the reasons most commonly cited for entering into a small business is to regain the control over one&#146;s life and work-life balance, the purpose of this research is to investigate work-life balance from the perspective of small business owners. Examination of different research issues considering the perception of work-life balance, the impact of control, of owning a small business, and the choice of business model on work-life balance is undertaken. The research considers how small business owners perceive the concept of work-life balance, and whether it is regarded as important to them. This research seeks to understand how work-life balance is viewed differently for small business owners. The concept of control requires examination to clarify how control and work-life balance relate to each other. Due to the popularity of franchising in the small business sector, a comparison of the concept of work-life balance by both franchised and independent small business owners is warranted...</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">work-life balance</field><field name="subject">small business</field><field name="subject">lifestyle</field><field name="subject">small business owners</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100617.110649</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD.

With the proposed map personalisation approach, only relevant data will be extracted from detailed maps/geo-spatial services on the fly, based on a user&#8217;s current location, preferences and requirements. This would result in dramatic improvements in the legibility of maps on mobile device screens, as well as significant reductions in the amount of data being transmitted; which, in turn, would reduce the download time and cost of transferring the required geo-spatial data across mobile networks. Furthermore, the proposed map personalisation approach has been implemented into a working system, based on a four-tier client server architecture, wherein fully detailed maps/services are stored on the server, and upon a user&#8217;s request personalised maps/services, extracted from the fully detailed maps/services based on the user&#8217;s current location, preferences, are sent to the user&#8217;s mobile device through mobile networks. By using open and standard system development tools, our system is open to everyday mobile devices rather than smart phones and Personal Digital Assistants (PDA) only, as is prevalent in most current map personalisation systems. The proposed map personalisation approach combines content-based information filtering and collaborative information filtering techniques into an algorithmic solution, wherein content-based information filtering is used for regular users having a user profile stored on the system, and collaborative information filtering is used for new/occasional users having no user profile stored on the system. Maps/geo-spatial services are personalised for regular users by analysing the user&#8217;s spatial feature preferences automatically collected and stored in their user profile from previous usages, whereas, map personalisation for new/occasional users is achieved through analysing the spatial feature preferences of like-minded users in the system in order to make an inference for the target user. Furthermore, with the use of association rule mining, an advanced inference technique, the spatial features retrieved for new/occasional users through collaborative filtering can be attained. The selection of spatial features through association rule mining is achieved by finding interesting and similar patterns in the spatial features most commonly retrieved by different user groups, based on their past transactions or usage sessions with the system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile devices</field><field name="subject">Map personalisation</field><field name="subject">Association rule mining</field><field name="subject">Collaborative filtering</field><field name="subject">Content based filtering</field><field name="subject">User profiles</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Birthright-Matamuatanga</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Miles Maurice</field><field name="description">Set on a farm on the Kaipara Harbour of Northland, New Zealand, this novel traces the lives of a family over a six year period near the end of the twentieth century. Themes include: Scottish and Croatian-Dalmatian immigration, M&#257;ori spiritual and cultural values, the weaving and assimilation of diverse cultures into a vibrant new culture, the economics of farming on marginal lands, father-son relationships, sibling rivalry, marijuana cultivation and the disparities between urban and rural lifestyles and expectations. The plotline follows the frustrations and subsequent actions of the eldest son as he seeks a future, which he realises is dependent on his acquiring the family farm. His impulsive behaviour leads to the climax of the story and puts himself and other members of the family in jeopardy and risks the family losing the farm altogether.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Kaipara Harbour</field><field name="subject">Kaiwaka</field><field name="subject">Maori-Pakeha relations</field><field name="subject">Patrimony</field><field name="subject">Marijuana cultivation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/921</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talanoa: a contribution to the teaching and learning of Tongan Primary School children in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Latu, Makelesi</field><field name="description">Tongan migrants migrated to New Zealand with specific purposes in mind. One purpose is for Tongan children to gain the benefits of good education that New Zealand has to offer. However, there is a growing concern for Tongan parents and New Zealand teachers and schools about the quality and impact of education Tongan children receive. The study is titled, &#8220;Talanoa: A contribution to the teaching and learning of Tongan Primary School children in New Zealand&#8221; centres on Tongan parents who are recent migrants from Tonga and have primary school children. The research focuses on alternative approach in teaching and learning pedagogies of Tongan children in New Zealand. The research approach is drawn from Tongan language and cultural practices called talanoa, a communal act of social, political and critical dialogue for a purpose. The methodology is qualitative in design, drawing extensively from Tongan language and culture to research the koloa (values) of talanoa that Tongan parents practise at home. The method of data collection employed is talanoa (critical dialogue) conducted in groups with Tongan parents to capture their perceptions, views and experiences of talanoa in their various homes. In examining this unique context, data is analysed using the Tongan concept koloa. The values of talanoa when explored from the participant&#8217;s perspective are more clearly understood. The findings of the study indicate that Tongan migrants&#8217; home practice of talanoa offers a teaching and learning pedagogy which is valued as a best approach in teaching their children. The findings further indicate that talanoa can be extended beyond the homes and into many classroom environments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Talanoa</field><field name="subject">Koloa</field><field name="subject">Tongan Primary School children in New Zealand</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social fabric: a sustainable social-entrepreneurial fashion collaboration with female refugees in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hillenaar, Kareen Elese</field><field name="description">This paper describes a Master of Art and Design research project developing a social entrepreneurial design process in fashion.

Intranasal delivery of therapeutic gene products into the brain offers a non-invasive alternative towards a feasible gene and protein therapy for neurological diseases. From recent studies involving axonal transport, it is tempting to speculate that therapeutic macromolecules including neurotrophic factors and viral vectors can be delivered into the brain by peripheral neurons, such as olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), which span the BBB. It is thought that the nasal pathway into the brain involves two general mechanisms; intracellular (intraneuronal) or extracellular routes of transport. However the pathways involved have not yet been fully characterized.
	In this study I firstly investigated the temporal and spatial localisation pattern of both biotinylated and I125 labelled ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) following nasal delivery into Sprague-Dawley rats. Results showed that intranasal delivered CNTF was transported to several brain regions by both intracellular axonal pathway through ORNs and the extracellular trigeminal pathway. Excess unlabelled CNTF competed for receptor binding in the olfactory mucosa confirming receptor mediated intracellular transport to the olfactory bulb via ORNs. Denervation of the olfactory mucosa prior to CNTF delivery failed to prevent CNTF transport to trigeminal and hypothalamic brain regions. Intranasal delivered CNTF was biologically active, resulting in activation of the STAT3 signalling pathway in the thalamus and hypothalamus.
	To examine the functional activity of intranasal delivered CNTF, I conducted a weight loss trial using an obese Zucker rat (OZR) model to test whether CNTF treatment caused body weight loss. Intranasal administration of CNTF resulted in reduced body weight in the CNTF treated OZR group compared to the BSA control group during the 12 day trial and for 3 days after. Intranasal delivery of CNTF may be a valuable method for the treatment of obesity. 
	In the second study, I investigated the temporal and spatial expression of Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein (EGFP) transferred by a single nasal delivery of either a recombinant adenovirus vector (Ad5CMV-EGFP) or an adeno-associated virus vector (AAV2-EGFP) into Sprague-Dawley rats. Adenovirus mediated EGFP expression was localized in ORNs throughout the olfactory epithelium after 24 hours. EGFP in the ORNs appeared to be anterogradely transported along their axons to the olfactory bulb and transferred in glomeruli to second-order neurons. EGFP was transferred to several brain regions including the cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem after 7 days. EGFP expression co-localized with Olfactory Marker Protein and was confirmed with EGFP immunofluorescence labelling and western blotting. AAV expressed EGFP localized in similar olfactory and brain regions 6 weeks after delivery. mRNA levels suggested that the AAV-EGFP construct was only incorporated into olfactory mucosa cells and the viral vector was not present in olfactory bulb and brain regions.
	In conclusion, this simple and non-invasive polypeptide and gene delivery method provides ubiquitous macromolecule distribution throughout the rodent brain and may be useful for the treatment of neurological disorders.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intranasal delivery</field><field name="subject">CNTF</field><field name="subject">olfactory</field><field name="subject">obesity</field><field name="subject">BBB</field><field name="subject">AAV</field><field name="subject">adenovirus</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20091203.124916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">DIVERSITY MANAGEMENT IN AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE SPECIALISING IN INDIGENOUS TERTIARY EDUCATION: A CASE STUDY AND CRITICAL REVIEW</field><field name="creator">Wikander, Lolita</field><field name="description">This thesis will examine the organisational culture and work context at Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education (BIITE) as it relates to diversity management and cultural safety/identity. This research will have wider relevance as a means to understanding organisational cultures in a globalising world where cross cultural collaboration is becoming commonplace. The philosophical underpinnings of this project are critical and deconstructionist with a framework based on the principles of Participatory Action Research while simultaneously incorporating an autoethnographic component.
The key concepts considered in this research include Industrial relations, organisational structure, relevant policies, affirmative action, both-ways and diversity management including cultural safety and cross-culture/cross-paradigm communication.
The term cultural safety is considered from the point of view of the literature and the participants. The types of situations the participants identified as culturally challenging are listed and the participants&#146; reactions to these cultural challenges are divided into two main categories: Isolationism and complementarism which is further divided into incommensurability and (in)commensurability. Parallels are drawn between isolationism and solipsism and between (in)commensurability and Intersubjectivity before
examining the participants&#146; own recommendations for improving the management of diversity within BIITE. The effects my own interaction with the literature and the participants had on my thought process during this time are also explored.
Recommendations for BIITE in relation to diversity are made. These recommendations incorporate the philosophy of both ways which underpins BIITE&#146;s current strategic plan and are based on the implementation of a more participatory management style utilising Flood and Romm&#146;s (1996) triple loop learning model. Recommendations are also aimed at educators teaching content which may be threatening to their students&#146; cultural safety/identity.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Diversity Management</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20100603.131355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucose requirements to maintain euglycaemia during and following moderate intensity afternoon exercise in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus : an insight to the risk of exercise-associated hypoglycaemia.</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Sarah Kate</field><field name="description">Exercise has a wide range of benefits for patients with type 1 diabetes, including improvements in body composition, cardiovascular risk profile and glycaemic control. Unfortunately, exercise also increases the risk of hypoglycaemia in children with type 1 diabetes, both at the time of exercise and for many hours afterwards. The availability of clear, evidence-based guidelines regarding appropriate adjustments in carbohydrate intake or insulin doses may help to prevent this exercise associated hypoglycaemia. However, current guidelines regarding exercise in children with type 1 diabetes rely heavily on adult literature or the consensus of experts. Therefore, further studies are needed in young people with diabetes to document the metabolic responses during and following exercise. In particular, the mechanisms underlying hypoglycaemia occurring many hours after exercise require further exploration. In addition, as children often exercise in the afternoon, studies performed at this time of the day are more likely to be transferrable to a real life situation. For this reason, we studied adolescents with type 1 diabetes to investigate physiological responses to exercise, focusing on afternoon activity and employing a novel variation of the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique. The core experiments involved studying diabetic adolescents on two occasions in a counterbalanced, paired design during and after afternoon exercise. Insulin was infused at a constant rate based on the subjects' usual daily insulin dose and glucose was infused to maintain euglycaemia. At 1600 hrs subjects either exercised at a moderate intensity (95% of their lactate threshold) for 45 minutes on a cycle ergometer (exercise study), or sat on the ergometer without exercising (rest study). Using this experimental design, it was found that glucose infusion rates (GIR) to maintain euglycaemia were elevated during and shortly following exercise and again from 7-11 hours after exercise compared with the rest study. Counterregulatory hormone levels were similar between the exercise and rest studies except for peaks in noradrenaline, cortisol and growth hormone levels at the end of exercise. Glucagon and adrenaline levels did not increase with exercise. The observed biphasic increase in glucose requirements paralleled the observed clinical risk of hypoglycaemia immediately during exercise and the delayed risk of hypoglycaemia which often occurs overnight.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypoglycemia</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Risk factors</field><field name="subject">Glucose -- Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Blood sugar</field><field name="subject">Exercise for children</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Hypoglycaemia</field><field name="subject">Hypoglycemia</field><field name="subject">Child</field><field name="subject">Type 1 diabetes mellitus</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The White Phantom: Revenants of Ophelia in Nineteenth-Century British Literature and Culture</field><field name="creator">Melissa Dickson</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the cultural, ideological, and literary background of and assumptions underpinning interpretations and representations of Shakespeare&#8217;s Ophelia in nineteenth-century Britain.

This thesis details my investigation into the physiological ecology of solar ultraviolet (UV) absorbing compounds, known as mycosporine-like amino acids found in the external epithelial mucus, and examines the supporting role potentially played by a UV-induced DNA repair mechanism in coral reef fish of the Indo-Pacific. Using reverse phase chromatography and UV spectrophotometry, I examined whether the distribution of MAA compounds across different areas of the body is correlated with differential UV exposure. Comparisons were made between the MAA content and the absorbance spectra of mucus from the dorsal, ventral, caudal and head body surface areas in five species of Scaridae (Chlorurus sordidus, Scarus schlegeli, S. niger, S. psittacus and S. globiceps) from Ningaloo Reef, Coral Bay, Western Australia. All fish analysed had at least five MAAs present, and results showed that fish had increased UV absorbance in mucus over the dorsal area, which receives the brunt of UV radiation. Little UV protection was found in mucus from the ventral area, which receives the lower level of UV radiation mostly via reflection of the sand and reef surfaces. Furthermore, UV absorbance per mg dry mucus versus standard fish length showed that there is a positive relationship in C. sordidus with increasing size. I examined whether there is a difference in the quantity of UV screening compounds found in the mucus of fish along a longitudinal geographical gradient from inshore reefs (Lizard Island, Great Barrier Reef) to the outer edge reefs to oceanic reefs (Osprey Reef). MAA absorbance increased with longitudinal distance from the mainland landmass of Australia to more oligotrophic outer reefs, where UV attenuation is reduced and the ocean is more transparent to UV wavelength. I determined that fish living on inshore, more turbid reefs where UV attenuation in shallow waters is high have lower levels of MAA protection than fish from clear oceanic reefs. Furthermore, there seems to be a direct relationship between light attenuation and exposure with the quantity of protective sunscreening found in the mucus of reef fish. It is know that UV irradiation decreases with water depth and that mucus from fish with deep habitats absorbs less UV than that of fish from shallow habitats. It is unknown however, whether this UV protection is variable within the same individuals and if so, how fast changes 11 occur. To test this, I relocated 9 ambon damselfish from a deep reef (18 m) to a shallow reef (1.5 m) to expose fish to increased levels of UV and relocated another 7 fish from a shallow to a deep reef to expose fish to decreased levels of UV. One week after relocation, all fish were returned to their original reef site to determine whether MAA levels would return to their initial levels. Fish relocated to a shallower depth were recovered and had a 60% (SD+/-2%) increase in mucus UV absorbance. Conversely, the fish relocated to a deeper depth were recovered and had a 41% (SD+/-1%) decrease mucus UV absorbance. No difference was found between UV absorbance of relocated and original fish at both depth. Six days after fish were returned to their original reef, mucus UV absorbance levels had returned to 67% +/- 4% of the original level. These results show that mucus UV absorbance is variable in individual ambon damselfish and that the sunscreen protection typical for a certain depth is reached in relocated fish within just a few days of relocation. The rate of MAA loss is higher than the accumulation of MAAs suggesting that diet is not the sole determining factor involved in the sequestration of MAAs to mucus. The cleaner fish Labroides dimidiatus performs a mutualistic service by removing ectoparasites such as gnathiid isopods as well other dead infected tissue from its clients. Cleaner fish however are also known to feed on client mucus. The benefits of eating mucus until recently were unclear. In this study, we analysed the mucus of several cleaner fish clients to determine whether mucus feeding has a nutritional advantage over gnathiids and whether cleaner fish obtain their own MAA protection through this dietary mucus ingestion. Results show that host fish that are infected with gnathiids of poor nutritional value, in contrast to those that harbour gnathiids with higher nutritional value, continuously exude mucus that has both high nutritional value and high MAA content. These findings support the conclusion that in a competitive market for cleaners some host fish are forced to offer more than parasites to cleaners. Ultraviolet light that is not filtered by UV absorbing compounds such as MAA may still lead to DNA damage such as the formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs). However, coral reef fish have alternative mechanisms to overcome UV induced damage via the photolyase DNA repair mechanisms. We experimentally demonstrated for the first time that a coral reef fish species, the moon wrasse Thalassoma lunare has the ability to repair DNA damage via photoreactivation. Fish both with and without MAA protection were irradiated with UVB wavelength to induce DNA lesions. Half of the experimental fish were then exposed to photoreactivating wavelength to induce DNA repair 12 while the other fish were blocked from the repair mechanisms. Fish which had undergone DNA repair had the lowest number of lesions regardless of mucus MAA protection. When fish were blocked from photoreactivation wavelengths MAA sunscreens clearly served a photoprotective role. The amount of damage was greatest in fish which both lacked MAAs and which were also blocked from photoreactivating wavelengths. Thus for the overall UV protection of fish both the MAA sunscreens as well as the DNA repair system play a significant role in counteracting UV damage. Ultraviolet protection by MAA sunscreens is ubiquitous in marine fish. To date the same 5 MAA compounds (palythine (&#955;max 320 nm), asterina (&#955;max 330 nm), palythinol (&#955;max 332 nm), usujirene (&#955;max 357 nm) and palythene (&#955;max 360nm) have been identified in the mucus of several different species of reef fish from Australia. Here we report the first evidence of the presence of additional UV absorbing compounds found in the mucus of fish from Indonesia. Using UV spectroscopy the mucus of four species of fish was compared between both geographical regions. The presence of an additional peak between 294-296 nm wavelengths suggests the presence of gadusol and/or deoxygadusol, which are photoprotective compounds, thought to be the precursors of MAAs. Thus, UV protecting compounds in the mucus of fish may not be as conserved between different regions as previously assumed. Our knowledge concerning the effect of UV radiation has advanced considerably in the past decade and my research findings contribute to the better understanding of protective mechanisms of marine fish. The correlations I have found between UV attenuation/exposure, depth, and longitude of sampled individuals lead me to believe that mucus UV absorbing MAA compounds are a highly efficient adaptive defence.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mucus</field><field name="subject">MAAs</field><field name="subject">Mycosporine-like Amino Acids</field><field name="subject">palythine</field><field name="subject">asterina</field><field name="subject">palythinol</field><field name="subject">palythene</field><field name="subject">usujirene</field><field name="subject">gadusol</field><field name="subject">deoxygadusol</field><field name="subject">UV absorbing compounds</field><field name="subject">Sunscreen</field><field name="subject">photoprotection</field><field name="subject">ultraviolet radiation</field><field name="subject">UV</field><field name="subject">photoenzymatic repair</field><field name="subject">photolyase</field><field name="subject">cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)</field><field name="subject">6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PPs)</field><field name="subject">DNA repair</field><field name="subject">Melanophores</field><field name="subject">parrotfish</field><field name="subject">Wrasse</field><field name="subject">Scaridae</field><field name="subject">Labroides dimidiatus</field><field name="subject">Chlorurus sordidus</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Just because you lead us, it doesn't mean we have to like you: How can anti-norm leaders mitigate negative evaluations from their group members?</field><field name="creator">Ning Xiang</field><field name="description">Through the lens of the social identity approach (Haslam, 2004; Hogg &amp; Terry, 2001) and in particular, the subjective group dynamics (SGD) model (Abrams, Randsley de Moura, Hutchison, &amp; Viki, 2005) and an organisational justice perspective (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003), the current program of research set out to explore, in two phases, how anti-norm leaders can mitigate negative responses by their group members when they wish to lead their group towards the prescriptive norms of an outgroup. The first phase of the research, comprising three pilot tests, and Study 1, Study 2a and 2b investigated how anti-norm leaders were judged by ingroup members, and two possible moderators of this effect. Study 1 aimed to replicate the basic findings of Abrams et al. (2008) and explore whether group members&#8217; evaluations of normative and deviant leaders would be moderated by the leaders&#8217; method of gaining leadership (appointed vs. elected). Study 2a and 2b examined whether group members&#8217; evaluations of normative and anti-norm leaders were moderated by the relationship of the ingroup to the authority who appointed the leader. The second phase of the research, comprising three pilot tests and Studies 3, 4 and 5, moved to consider what could help anti-norm leaders gain positive evaluations from members of their group in an organisational context. Drawing on the group engagement model (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003), the traditional leadership literature (Hollander, 1958; Hollander &amp; Julian, 1970), and relevant literature from the social identity approach (Hornsey, 2005; Morton, Postmes, &amp; Jetten, 2007) the second phase aimed to examine whether perceived respect from the leader could help the anti-norm leader to gain more positive evaluations from their group members. Study 3 replicated the design of Studies 2a and 2b in a pseudo-organisational scenario with perceived respect from the leader as an additional measured variable. Study 4 explored the impact of the informal quality of treatment (IQT) received by the ingroup members from the leader on perceptions of the anti-norm leader. In addition, the proposed mediating effect of perceived respect from the leader was examined. Study 5 examined whether respect for the group&#8217;s history by the leader would diminish the negative responses of group members to an anti-norm leader. Across the six pilot studies and six main studies, and consistent with the SGD model (Abrams et al., 2005; Abrams et al., 2008), normative leaders were consistently endorsed more, or evaluated more positively, than anti-norm leaders. Across the different testing contexts, incumbent anti-norm leaders were derogated regardless whether they were appointed or elected or whether the outgroup who appointed them had an incompatible or irrelevant relationship with the ingroup. Further, whilst showing high IQT to group members helped anti-norm leaders obtain similar evaluations as to those obtained by low IQT normative leaders, exhibiting high levels of respect for group history failed to help anti-norm leaders mitigate negative evaluations from their group members. These findings suggest that, in line Abrams et al. (2008), once an individual becomes a leader, group members do not take into consideration how that leader came to be or where they came from in evaluations. Instead, group members seem to focus on what the leader does, or can do, for the group. Whilst respect at the group, and particularly at the individual, level can have a limited impact on evaluations, it would seem that little that the leader can do on their own will moderate the negative evaluations of them that stem from the fact that their position fundamentally undermines the validity of prescriptive ingroup norms. As such, and consistent with SGD literature (Abrams et al., 2005; Abrams et al., 2008), the findings of the current program of research demonstrate the overwhelmingly robust motivation of group members to derogate anti-norm leaders who undermine prescriptive ingroup norms. For leaders faced with the challenging task of leading their ingroup towards the prescriptive norms of an outgroup, the findings of the current program of research suggest that, consistent with the group engagement model (Tyler &amp; Blader, 2003) bolstering respect for group members through enacting both informal and formal procedures may be somewhat effective. Alternatively, and to carry the black sheep analogy dominant in this line of research further, the anti-norm leader may simply constitute the proverbial &#8216;sacrificial lamb&#8217; &#8211; that is rejected and unpopular among the people he or she is supposed to lead.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="subject">Subjective group dynamics</field><field name="subject">organisational justice</field><field name="subject">leadership</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205159</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an Elegant, Thermally Benign Johnson-Claisen Rearrangement</field><field name="creator">Kelly Cosgrove</field><field name="description">The Johnson-Claisen rearrangement is a valuable method for the formation of new carbon-carbon bonds, however the rearrangement suffers from high reaction temperatures and prolonged reaction times. On the basis of previous research into substituent-induced rate enhancements of the Claisen rearrangement, we aimed to reduce the severity of the Johnson-Claisen conditions by applying this reaction to allylic cyanohydrins. Application of the standard Johnson-Claisen conditions (excess of orthoester and catalytic protic acid) to allylic cyanohydrins resulted in their decomposition to a,b- unsaturated aldehydes. The anticipated d-ethoxycarbonyl-a,b-unsaturated nitriles were formed in trace amounts. Subsequent optimisation of this reaction has allowed a practical entry into a,b- unsaturated nitriles in reasonable yields, however high reaction temperatures were necessary for an efficient conversion. Clearly, a change of approach was desired; we have since discovered that mixed orthoesters derived from allylic alcohols undergo methanol elimination in the presence of triisobutylaluminium (TIBAL) at room temperature to form mixed ketene acetals. TIBAL then promotes immediate Claisen rearrangement of these intermediates, and subsequent reduction of the ester products to yield, g,d- unsaturated primary alcohols in a convenient one-pot procedure, with yields ranging from 52-81% and with a range of functional group tolerance.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyanohydrin, Johnson-Claisen rearrangement, allylic alcohol, mixed orthoester,</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Influence of Children on Female Wages: Better or Worse in Australia?</field><field name="creator">Amanda Hosking</field><field name="description">Australian women&#8217;s participation in paid work has been and continues to be strongly influenced by gendered patterns of parental care. This thesis examines how children structure another dimension of economic stratification in Australia, hourly wages. Previous studies from the United States and Great Britain show women who care for children have lower wages than their childless counterparts and that this motherhood gap in pay is partly explained by mothers&#8217; interruptions to employment and movement into part-time jobs. Outside the US and Britain fewer studies of the motherhood gap in pay have been undertaken. Compared to these two countries, Australia has lower maternal employment rates and higher rates of part-time work. These features may increase wage disparities between mothers and childless women in the Australian labour market. Australia, unlike Britain and the United States, has a history of centralised wage regulation, leading to a comparatively narrower wage distribution and a higher minimum wage. These institutional features may offer protection against downward wage mobility. This thesis investigates how motherhood influences the hourly wages of Australian women using panel data. Previous Australian research has documented static wage disparities, relying on cross-sectional data. My analysis draws on the first six waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey (2001-2006), a large, nationally representative panel survey. The thesis is comprised of three studies. First, I investigate the overall motherhood gap in pay in Australia in 2001. In aggregate, the mean wage of women with children is equal to that of childless women. After imputing a potential wage for mothers who are not employed, I show that the overall motherhood gap in pay would be considerably wider in Australia were fewer mothers to exit the labour force. This is because mothers without tertiary qualifications are less likely to be employed than mothers with a certificate, diploma or degree. Second, I use the panel design of HILDA to estimate female wage equations using fixed-effects regression. Controlling for differences in observed human capital, part-time work and unobserved heterogeneity, I find each child lowers wages by 6%. The analysis also reveals that mothers&#8217; propensity to work part-time does not explain any of the Australian motherhood gap in pay. After incorporating detailed controls for time-varying job characteristics, I find that part-time wages are 14% higher than full-time wages. On average, the pay premium for part-time work more than offsets the pay penalty associated with one or two children. Third, I narrow my focus to Australian women experiencing a birth between 2001 and 2006, assessing whether the wage premium for part-time work extends to transitions at this point in the lifecourse. I investigate patterns of wage growth among mothers returning to employment within 3 years of a birth. My results reveal that Australian mothers who transition from full-time to part-time hours have significantly higher wage growth than mothers who remain in full-time employment. Taken together, my results suggest women&#8217;s part-time employment has a distinctive form in Australia. I find no evidence Australian mothers&#8217; part-time employment constitutes a low-paid segment of the labour force. Isolating a causal explanation for the comparatively high wages of Australian women&#8217;s part-time employment is difficult, though two factors are likely to be important. First, Australian mothers&#8217; participation in part-time employment rapidly increased during the 1970s and 1980s, a period when wages were largely regulated through collective agreements. Although wage determination has become more deregulated since the mid-1980s, the principle that part-time employees should receive pro rata wages does not appear to have been contested by Australian employers. This could be because demand for labour in feminised industries has remained strong. Second, decisions to remain attached to employment around childbirth could possibly be structured by the availability of part-time work. Rather than transition into a lower waged part-time job, Australian mothers may exit the labour force drawing on supports for stay-at-home mothers in the Australian family payment and taxation system. In the longer term, mothers who continue in part-time work may have fewer opportunities for upward mobility and flatter wage trajectories. As additional waves of HILDA become available, such divergences in wage trajectories will be able to be empirically investigated. This study examines female wages in a period of strong economic growth and low unemployment. Part-time employment may not be positively associated with wages in a macroeconomic context of lower demand for labour and rising unemployment. An interesting avenue for future research would be to compare how transitions into part-time work influence female wages across periods of strong and weak labour market growth.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motherhood wage penalty</field><field name="subject">female wages</field><field name="subject">mothers&#8217; employment</field><field name="subject">part-time work</field><field name="subject">Australian labour market</field><field name="subject">HILDA</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional whole-of-government in Central Queensland: a sociocultural interpretation</field><field name="creator">Barton Loechel</field><field name="description">Over past decades, governments within Australia and throughout the Western world have sought to establish multi-sectoral planning processes that operate at a regional scale. Research on these processes has tended to focus on the challenges of &#8216;joining-up&#8217; government and non-government sectors to create robust, effective and democratic regional structures and processes. Far less attention has been paid to integration within and between the various entities of government involved within these regional governance initiatives. This thesis, therefore, investigates the role of inter-governmental integration, or &#8216;whole-of-government&#8217; activities, in relation to regional multi-sectoral governance. The institutional forms, enabling and constraining factors, and implications of inter-governmental arrangements between the various agencies and levels of government are examined. The study applies a sociocultural approach to institutional analysis. Commonly known as grid-group cultural theory, this approach provides a conceptual framework for identifying the fundamental social dynamics underlying differing forms of social organisation and governance. This framework specifies the primary forms, modus operandi and enabling social contexts of inter-institutional integration. These are, respectively: coordination by authority within hierarchy; cooperation through self-interest based collective action within competitive individualism; and collaboration through trust and a sense of commitment to the group within a communitarian social context. This study sought to investigate whole-of-government within regional governance through examination of two contemporaneous region-wide, multi-sectoral planning projects in Central Queensland, Australia. These were, namely, Central Queensland: A New Millennium, covering planning across a broad suite of issues, and the Fitzroy Basin Association, more specifically focussing on natural resource management planning for the region. Both bodies were in the process of implementing their regional plans at the time of this study. A qualitative case study methodology was employed in research, involving in-depth interviews with government officials, examination of project documents, and participation at meetings. The research data were analysed to identify the main processes and perceived outcomes of the two projects, and underlying factors relating to these. The two regional planning processes were generally perceived to have resulted in widely differing levels of success, and with many of the same government officials involved, there was considerable scope to contrast the whole-of-government structures and processes applied in the two cases. Analysis of the case material in the light of the theoretical framework and broader literature emphasised the nested and subordinate nature of regional whole-of-government efforts within the broader system of government. This system was revealed as characterised by horizontal fragmentation between departments and between jurisdictional tiers of government (Federal, State, and Local) but strong vertical integration within departments. The research highlighted the importance of central level political commitment to regional level integration efforts. Support is seen as particularly important in the form of 1) the political will to direct high-level coordination between departments and to advance cooperation between tiers of government; 2) sufficient resources allocated to regional plan implementation in order to motivate inter-governmental cooperation at a range of levels; and 3) the granting of sufficient autonomy to ensure effective devolution and regional level ownership that assists cooperation and collaboration at the regional level. In the light of the decisive importance of central level support, it was found that while high quality regional level leadership of regional whole-of-government processes is a necessary condition for their success, it is not a sufficient condition. To be effective, regional whole-of-government leadership requires both meaningful devolution and substantive central support. The study identified the multiple and contradictory forms of inter-governmental relations that comprise the social contexts at different levels within the broader system of government. In particular, the case study comparison suggested that success at the regional level relies on the application, at all levels, of forms and mechanisms of inter-governmental integration that are appropriate to the specific social contexts within which they are embedded.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional governance</field><field name="subject">whole-of-government</field><field name="subject">Joined-up government</field><field name="subject">grid-group cultural theory</field><field name="subject">cultural theory</field><field name="subject">multi-sectoral collaboration</field><field name="subject">inter-agency collaboration</field><field name="subject">inter-governmental relations</field><field name="subject">Regional planning -- Queensland.</field><field name="subject">Central Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clathrin Independent Carriers: Molecular characterisation of a novel clathrin-independent endocytic pathway</field><field name="creator">Mark Howes</field><field name="description">Endocytosis effectuates a critical interface between the eukaryotic cell and its apposing environment. It is, subsequently, paramount for many physiologically important processes and encompasses a diverse array of mechanisms and pathways. The classical endocytic routes mediated by clathrin and caveolin are the best understood and the molecular roles of their major regulators, such as dynamin, adaptor proteins and various lipid species, are the most comprehensively described. Recent identification of an assortment of constitutive, noncaveolar, clathrin-independent endocytic (CIE) pathways has expanded the endocytic system. Unlike the classical endocytic pathways, little is known about the guiding parameters of CIE routes. Consequently, it is not possible to understand the important cellular roles these pathways may be fulfilling. This study has begun to characterise the very basic parameters governing the morphologically striking Clathrin-Independent Carrier (CLIC) pathway. Development of a diverse molecular toolkit has now allowed the quantitation of endocytic capacity provided by CLICs, the visualisation of subtle sorting components of the CLIC pathway, the isolation of novel CLIC cargo and regulators, and has linked this mechanism to the critical cellular processes of cellular migration and membrane repair. Calculation of the individual capacity of endocytic routes provides important information about the contribution of each pathway to total plasma membrane (PM) uptake and turnover. Quantitation of the volume, surface area and number of structures forming per minute in this study shows that CLICs provide the vast majority of constitutive endocytosis, up to four times the capacity of the clathrin mediated endocytic (CME) pathway. As the equivalent of the entire PM area could pass through the CLIC pathway within 12 minutes it is evident that CLICs are fundamental housekeepers of bulk membrane internalisation. Thus, they are likely to be central regulators of PM homeostasis and turnover. High-resolution tomography, in conjunction with analysis of CLIC cargo trafficking, identifies these carriers as complex, pleiomorphic structures that sort the bulk of membrane to early endosomes and recycle cargo back to the cell surface. Such vast internalisation combined with an ability to rapidly recycle components quickly attributes the CLIC pathway as a complex sorting station. Isolation of novel cargo and regulators has identified a striking array of proteins now associated with the CLIC pathway for the first time. A significant proportion of identified targets localise to lipid-rafts and recycle from the PM, facets consistent with association to the CLIC pathway. Numerous targets have also been directly implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis by independent groups. Verification of selected cargo, such as CD44, Thy-1 and myoferlin, showing specific internalisation through the CLIC pathway, has provided insight into the sorting ability of the CLIC pathway and links to adhesion turnover and membrane recycling. Consistent with a role in cellular adhesion turnover, it was found that CLICs become polarised within migrating cells. This has shown the first instance of spatial separation between three major endocytic routes, CLICs, caveolae and CME and highlights the important and coordinated roles of multiple endocytic pathways during physiologically significant processes. The specific internalisation of paxillin, Thy-1 and CD44 through CLICs at the leading edge of migrating cells suggests that CLICs rapidly turnover adhesion components for dynamic extracellular sensation during directional cell migration. Indeed, specific ablation of the CLIC pathway significantly impedes cellular migration, implying coordination with CME at the leading edge. This study has defined numerous parameters of the CLIC pathway, developing the current understanding of this poorly defined route and places the CLIC pathway as a unique player during critical cellular processes.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Endosome</field><field name="subject">Clathrin-independent Endocytosis</field><field name="subject">Gpi-anchored Protein-enriched Early Endosomal Compartment</field><field name="subject">Lipid Rafts</field><field name="subject">Membrane Trafficking</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sintering of an Aluminium Alloy Under Pressurised Conditions</field><field name="creator">Stephen Bonner</field><field name="description">Increasing concern over the environmental impact of motor vehicles is driving the need for the development of lighter materials to reduce automobile weight and fuel consumption. Sintered aluminium alloys, with their high strength to weight ratios, have potential applications in the automotive industry, but conventional pressed-and-sintered materials have poor mechanical properties due to the presence of residual porosity in the sintered compact. Residual porosity can be eliminated by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPing) or combined sinter-HIPing, but these processes are expensive due to the high gas pressures involved, up to several hundred MPa, and also pose a significant safety hazard. There is a limited amount of evidence in the literature suggesting that applied gas pressures as low as a few MPa may be beneficial to the sintering of aluminium alloys, and it is this idea that the present work explores. Compacts of aluminium alloy 2712 (Al-3.8Cu-1Mg-0.7Si-0.1Sn) were prepared from elemental powders and sintered at 590&#186;C for up to 60 minutes in a horizontal tube furnace under constant flowing nitrogen or argon at pressures up to 600 kPa. Archimedes&#8217; method was used to measure the density of sintered compacts, and the amount of open and closed porosity. Increasing the nitrogen pressure at the start of the isothermal holding stage to 160 kPa increased the sintering rate compared to standard atmospheric pressure sintering. Increasing the nitrogen pressure further, up to 600 kPa, had no additional benefit. The sintering rate was increased further by applying a 600 kPa nitrogen pressure during both heating and isothermal holding. The elevated nitrogen pressure had a negligible effect on the maximum sintered density achieved, and sintering in argon at elevated pressures had no measurable effect on the sintered density or sintering rate. It was shown that the elevated pressure aids in the closure of pores open to the specimen surface, contrary to HIPing and sinter-HIPing, where the pores must be isolated prior to the application of pressure. It was also shown that at 600 kPa nitrogen pressure, the sintered density was independent of the presence of tin in the alloy. The improvements to sintering seem to be related to the formation of aluminium nitride.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aluminium</field><field name="subject">sintering</field><field name="subject">powder metallurgy</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">pressure</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grain Refinement of Cast Titanium Alloys</field><field name="creator">Michael Bermingham</field><field name="description">&#946;-grain size is an influential microstructural parameter on the properties of titanium components. A reduction of &#946;-grain size is generally associated with improvements to ductility, strength, corrosion and fatigue resistance of many &#945;, &#945;/&#946; and &#946; titanium alloys. During production of wrought titanium components, the &#946;-grain size is carefully controlled during thermomechanical processing but there is currently no control of the &#946;-grain size during solidification of cast components. As such, this inability to control the &#946;-grain structure during solidification may limit the applications for solidification based technologies including casting, welding and direct metal deposition. Due to the limited knowledge of grain refinement practices and the lack of commercial grain refiners for the titanium system, this thesis investigates the mechanisms of &#946;-grain refinement during solidification of cast titanium alloys. In this thesis, generalized theories for grain refinement that have been developed from research into other metallic systems are applied to the titanium system. Similar to the findings from aluminium and magnesium research, it is shown that grain refinement of cast titanium alloys requires the addition of growth restricting solutes which provide constitutional undercooling as well as the presence of potent nucleant particles. It is demonstrated that commercially pure titanium contains a natural distribution of nuclei particles which may originate from the mould wall and when powerful growth restricting solutes are introduced, significant prior-&#946; grain refinement is achievable. All solutes investigated do not interact or poison the naturally occurring nucleants enabling the grain size of the titanium alloys to be predicted by an empirically determined relationship based on the growth restriction factor. A full list of growth restriction factors for various elements in titanium is determined and it is proven that growth restriction theory is valid in the titanium system. A further reduction in &#946;-grain size is achievable by introducing additional nucleant particles to titanium castings in conjunction with growth-restricting solutes. Using a novel technique, titanium powder was introduced to the melt stream prior to solidification and was mixed throughout the liquid. The powder particles partially melted and the oxide surface layer dissolved allowing intimate substrate-liquid contact, enabling the titanium substrates to act as sites for heterogeneous nucleation. Using this technique, it was possible to grain refine commercially pure titanium without foreign elemental addition and when growth restricting solutes were present it was possible to obtain approximately an order of magnitude grain size reduction. The results and concepts developed from this work may aid the future development of a commercial grain refiner for titanium. If a grain refiner is developed, its application will not just be limited to the titanium casting industry but may also benefit other solidification based technologies such as welding, direct metal deposition and wrought billet production.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grain Refinement</field><field name="subject">Titanium</field><field name="subject">Titanium alloys</field><field name="subject">Casting</field><field name="subject">Solidification</field><field name="subject">Growth Restriction</field><field name="subject">Inoculation</field><field name="subject">Beta-grain Size</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of High Prandtl Number Scalar Transfer in Fully Developed and Disturbed Turbulent Flow</field><field name="creator">Andrew Purchase</field><field name="description">Scalar (heat or mass) transfer plays an important role in many industrial and engineering applications. Difficulties in experimental measurements means that there is limited detailed information available, especially in the near-wall region. Prediction in simple flows is well documented and the basis for development of many Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. This is, however, not the case for scalar transfer, especially when the Prandtl (Pr) or Schmidt number (Sc) is much greater than unity. In complex flows that involve separation and reattachment, the scalar transfer coefficient is significantly different to that of fully developed turbulent flow. The purpose of this Thesis is to investigate high Prandtl number (Pr &#8805; 10) scalar transfer in fully developed (pipe) and disturbed (sudden pipe expansion) turbulent flow using CFD. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is the most straight-forward approach to the solution of turbulent flows with scalar transfer. However, this technique is computationally intensive because all turbulent scales need to be resolved by the simulation. Large eddy simulation (LES) is a compromise compared to DNS. Instead of resolving all spatial scales, LES resolves only the large-scales with the small-scales being accounted for by a subgrid-scale model. Chapter 2 details the mathematical, numerical and computational details of LES with scalar transfer. From this, an optimized and highly scalable parallel LES solver was developed based on state-of-the-art LES subgrid-scale models and numerical techniques. Chapter 3 provides a verification of the LES solver for fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Reynolds numbers between Re = 180 and 1050 were simulated with a single Prandtl number of Pr = 0.71. Detailed turbulent statistics are provided for Re = 180, 395 and 590 with varying grid resolution for each Reynolds number. The results from these simulations were compared to established experimental and numerical databases of fully developed turbulent pipe and channel flows. The LES solver was shown to be in good agreement with the prior work with most discrepancies being accounted for by only reporting the resolved (large-scale) component directly reported from the LES results. For a Prandtl number close to unity, the mechanisms of turbulent transport and scalar transfer are similar. The near-wall region was shown to be dominated by large-scale sweeping structures that bring high momentum and scalar concentrations to the near-wall region. These are convected parallel to the wall as diffusion mechanisms act to transfer this to the wall where dissipation takes effect. An ejection structure then acts to transport the resultant low momentum, scalar depleted fluid back to the bulk to be replenished and continue the cycle. As the Prandtl number increases, molecular diffusivity decreases relative to viscosity, and the mechanisms of scalar transfer differ to those at Pr = 0.71. This is investigated in Chapter 4 using simulations at Re = 180, 395 and 590, with detailed statistics at Re = 395 for Pr = 0.71, 5, 10, 100 and 200. Where possible the results are compared to other numerical work and the LES solver was shown to accurately resolve the higher Prandtl number flows. There are marked variations in the scalar transfer with increasing Prandtl number as the turbulent scalar transfer becomes concentrated closer to the wall and dominated by large-scale turbulent structures. Sweeping structures are still responsible for bringing the high scalar concentrations towards the wall, however, high Prandtl number scalars are unable to completely diffuse to the wall in the time that the structure is convected parallel to the wall adjacent to the diffusive sublayer. Therefore, most of the high Prandtl number scalar is returned to the bulk via the ejection structure rather than being dissipated at the wall. Chapter 5 uses the sudden pipe expansion (SPE) to investigate disturbed turbulent flow for an inlet Reynolds numbers of Reb = 15600 and a diameter ratio of E = 1.6. These simulation parameters were chosen to match the experimental LDA measurements of Stieglmeier et al. (1989). The LES results for a range of grid resolutions were shown to be in very good agreement with the experimental work. From the LES results it was determined that the fluctuations in the wall shear stress are important in the near-wall turbulent transport. These are the result of eddies originating from the free shear layer down-washing and impinging upon the wall. This is a more effective sweeping mechanism than that observed for the fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Despite the down-wash structures impinging upon the wall, a viscous sublayer still exists in the reattachment region, albeit much thinner than the fully developed turbulent pipe flow further downstream. Using the same Reynolds number and diameter ratio, scalar transfer simulations were also undertaken in the SPE with Prandtl numbers of Pr = 0.71, 5, 10, 100 and 200. An applied scalar flux was used to heat the expanded pipe wall. The LES results are in agreement with experimental Nusselt numbers from Baughn et al. (1984) for Pr = 0.71. The disturbed turbulent flow enhances the scalar transfer and this is the result of down wash events transporting low (cold) scalar from the inlet pipe to the near-wall of the expanded pipe. This cools the heated wall and enhances localized scalar transfer downstream of the expansion. A diffusive sublayer still exists in the reattachment region within the viscous sublayer for Prandtl numbers greater than unity. As the Prandtl number increases the diffusivity decreases relative to viscosity and near-wall scalar transfer enhancement decreases as the diffusion time-scales increase.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">les, scalar transfer, high Prandtl number, fully developed turbulent flow, disturbed turbulent flow, pipe flow, sudden pipe expansion</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In-Between-ness</field><field name="creator">Zhu, Ming</field><field name="description">A place for no place is a practice based research project that investigates the notion of in-between space.

The role of obesity on women&#8217;s fecundity has become a focus of attention in recent years. Successful treatment of infertility through Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is also compromised by the presence of obesity, which occurs in 30 % of women seeking treatment. A negative correlation exists between increased body mass index (BMI) and the number of collected oocytes and a lower birth rate after ART. Furthermore, a number of studies have established that weight loss improves natural conception rates in overweight women. Whether weight management can improve success rates in overweight / obese women undergoing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) has not been studied. The purpose of this project was to explore the role of short&#8211;term weight loss on potential pregnancy outcomes in overweight / obese women undergoing IVF programme. However, to establish this relationship, we proposed to carry out two studies to assess the following: (I) The feasibility of very low calorie diet (VLCD) during IVF treatment with respect to duration, level of restriction and tolerability of the diet during hormonal down regulation in women (Chapter 2). (II) How energy restriction may affect the quality of an early embryo in diet - induced obese mice with respect to various body weight and caloric intake (Chapter 3). In study (I), women preferred a shorter dietary intervention with greater energy restriction (456 kcal per day) to gradual energy restriction (1200 kcal / day for the first week, and afterward, 456 kcal / day) prior to oocyte transfer. Women were able to comply with the VLCD during IVF treatment and both dietary groups achieved a significant weight loss (mean 6.3 %). In study (II), by using obese mice, the effect of rapid weight loss (mean 12 %) was observed after 5 days of energy restriction. Ovulation rate was greater in the Obese group (HFD) (55.6%) and equal in both Control (CD) and Energy Restricted (HF / ER) (44.4 %) groups. The HF / ER group showed higher fertilisation rate (80 %) than HFD and CD (55% and 45.5%, correspondingly). The blastocyst stage was reached by half of the cultured embryos in both HF / ER and HFD groups and 33 % in the CD group. The quality of embryos that completed blastocyst formation did not differ between groups. However, postfertilisation development in females fed a high fat diet was slower compared to CD and HF / ER groups. In conclusion, this work illustrated a weight management prior conception and use of VLCD during IVF treatment in clinical study needs further investigation with regard to the dietary duration, level of energy restriction and how this combination will influence IVF treatment outcomes. Furthermore, as we were unable to determine the question of how the dietary intervention affects the quality of oocytes and the animal study illustrated a promising result, thus further studies are required.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reproduction; overweight; obese; female; diet; calorie restriction; mice; obstetrics; ART; embryo; zygote; blastocyst; BMI; nutrition; Optifast; VLCD</field><field name="subject">Low-calorie diet.</field><field name="subject">Reproductive technology.</field><field name="subject">Overweight women.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of key arthropods for the management of Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) in Coonawarra vineyards, South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Paull, Cate</field><field name="description">There is currently little knowledge about the dynamics of invertebrates in Australian viticultural ecosystems. This study was conducted in Coonawarra vineyards over three seasons (years) and has focused on identifying natural enemies, their seasonal phenology, multiple species interactions, and potential for the suppression of the pest lepidopteran Epiphyas postvittana (Tortricidae). The work presented in this thesis shows that endemic natural enemies have far greater potential to control E. postvittana than has been realised. An initial survey identified a diverse and abundant range of potential natural enemies. Of these, the species most likely to attack E. postvittana include a predatory mite Anystis baccarum and a number of hymenopteran parasitoids. The most abundant parasitoid in the vineyards was a braconid, Dolichogenidea tasmanica. Understanding the characteristic behaviour of parasitoids in response to host density can help to gauge their potential for pest suppression. The results of large-scale field experiments showed that the response of D. tasmanica to the density of E. postvittana was inversely density-dependent, and that parasitism was consistently higher in Cabernet Sauvignon compared with Chardonnay varieties. Despite the fact that interactions among multiple species of natural enemies can increase or decrease pest suppression, particularly when they share a common prey/host, few multispecies interactions have been investigated. Laboratory studies identified a novel interaction between the predatory mite A. baccarum an abundant predator in the vine canopy, the parasitoid D. tasmanica and host E. postvittana larvae. Although A. baccarum readily ate E. postvittana eggs and free roaming larvae, they could not access larva in their silk leaf rolls. However, the addition of D. tasmanica significantly increased predation of E. postvittana larvae, by altering the behaviour of host larvae and increasing their vulnerability to the mite. Experiments conducted at a landscape level in the Coonawarra showed that D. tasmanica was also present in habitat other than vineyards including native vegetation. However, it was not present in highly disturbed habitats. Although the exact mechanism for this remains unknown, results indicate that viticultural practices and resources in the surrounding landscape can influence the presence of parasitoids. Together, the findings presented in this thesis make a significant contribution towards developing sustainable pest management in Australian viticulture.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">invertebrate ecology; conservation biological control; parasitoids; Epiphyas postvittana; Tortricidae</field><field name="subject">Grapes Diseases and pests Control Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/47971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating bacterial biofilms in chronic Rhinosinusitis : an in vitro study, in vivo animal study and a examination of biofilms in human CRS.</field><field name="creator">Kien, Ha Rach</field><field name="description">Introduction Bacterial biofilms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS). This thesis consists of a number of separate studies. The results of each study were designed to help provide an evolution of knowledge that could be applied to our subsequent investigations on the topic of bacterial biofilms and chronic rhinosinusitis. In vitro studies were utilized to document the capacity of CRS bacteria to form biofilms as well as to investigate the efficacy of various antimicrobials at high concentrations. Additionally, an in vivo sheep model was developed to examine different biofilm detection techniques. Finally, a study of CRS patients was conducted to investigate the incidence of biofilm related sinus disease. Methods Our in vitro studies used 96 well crystal violet microtiter plate assays to determine the biofilm growth characteristics of S.aureus isolated from patients with CRS. Established biofilms were then subjected various antimicrobial agents, and the degree of biofilm reduction calculated to examine their potential for sinus biofilm treatment. A sheep sinusitis model involved performing endoscopic sinus surgery, occlusion of frontal sinus ostia and the introduction of bacteria. Mucosal specimens were subsequently examined for the presence of bacterial biofilms using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). CSLM was also used in a prospective study to document the presence bacterial biofilms on the mucosa of patients with CRS compared to controls. Results The findings of in vitro experiments revealed that not all isolates were capable of forming biofilms. Of the antibiotics tested, only Mupirocin was capable of reducing biofilm mass by 90% in all isolates. The animal model showed considerable variation in biofilm detection rates. The CSLM biofilm detection rate was 100% in obstructed sinuses with bacteria introduced, whereas TEM detected only 66%. Both these objective measures failed to identify biofilms in control groups. SEM found biofilms in all experimental groups including controls. CSLM analysis of CRS patients found Bacterial biofilms in 44% and no biofilms in controls. Conclusion The demonstration of biofilms in the sheep model for sinusitis and biofilms on the mucosal specimens of patients with CRS, and the ability of bacteria in CRS to form biofilms in vitro, further supports the hypothesis that biofilms play a role in the pathogenesis of CRS. CSLM is the modality of choice in documenting the presence of bacterial biofilms on sinus mucosal surfaces due to the inherent flaws of sampling error and subjectivity of TEM and SEM. Finally, CRS is a multi-factorial disease, topical Mupirocin via nasal irrigation may be a therapeutic option in patients with likely S.aureus biofilms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic rhinosinusitis; biofilms; CRS; bacterial biofilms;in-vitro; in-vivo</field><field name="subject">sinusitis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/53215</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genome damage and folate nutrigenomics in uteroplacental insufficiency.</field><field name="creator">Furness, Denise Lyndal Fleur</field><field name="description">Pregnancy complications associated with placental development affect approximately one third of all human pregnancies. Genome health is essential for placental and fetal development, as DNA damage can lead to pregnancy loss and developmental defects. During this developmental phase rapid DNA replication provides an increased opportunity for genome and epigenome damage to occur[1]. Maternal nutrition is one of the principal environmental factors supporting the high rate of cell proliferation and differentiation. Folate functions in one-carbon metabolism and regulates DNA synthesis, DNA repair and gene expression[1]. Deficiencies or defects in gene-nutrient interactions associated with one-carbon metabolism can lead to inhibition of cell division, cell cycle delay and an excessive apoptotic or necrotic cell death rate [2], which may affect placentation. This study is the first to investigate the association between genomic damage biomarkers in late pregnancy complications associated with uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) including preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The results indicate that genome damage in the form of micronucleated cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes at 20 weeks gestation is significantly increased in women at risk of developing an adverse pregnancy outcome. The observed OR for the high micronuclei frequency may be the highest observed for any biomarker selected in relation to risk of pregnancy complications to date (15.6 &#8211; 33.0). In addition, reduced apoptosis was observed in association with increased micronuclei, suggesting that the cells may have escaped specific cell-cycle checkpoints allowing a cell with DNA damage to proceed through mitosis. This study demonstrated that an increase in plasma homocysteine concentration at 20 weeks gestation is associated prospectively with the subsequent development of UPI, indicating a causal relationship. The MTR 2756 GG genotype was significantly associated with increased plasma homocysteine concentration and UPI. Furthermore, the MTHFD1 1958 single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with increased risk for IUGR.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">uteroplacental insufficiency; pre-eclampsia; IUGR; one-carbon metabolism; DNA damage; folate</field><field name="subject">Placenta Diseases.</field><field name="subject">Nutrition Genetic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beta-cyclodextrin modification and host-guest complexation.</field><field name="creator">Pham, Duc-Truc</field><field name="description">A series of five linked &#946;-cyclodextrin (&#946;CD) dimers N,N-bis(6 [superscript]A-deoxy-6[superscript]A-&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)-succinamide, 66&#946;CD&#8322;su, N-((2[superscript]A S,3 [superscript]A S)-3 [superscript]A-deoxy-3 [superscript]A-&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)-N&#8217;-(6 [superscript]A-deoxy-6 [superscript]A -&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)-urea, 36&#946;CD&#8322;su, N,N-bis((2 [superscript]A S,3 [superscript]A S)-3 [superscript]A -deoxy-3 [superscript]A-&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)-succinamide, 33&#946;CD&#8322;su, N,N-bis(6[superscript]A-deoxy-6[superscript]A-&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)-urea, 66&#946;CD&#8322;ur, and N-((2 [superscript]A S,3 [superscript]A S)-3 [superscript]A-deoxy-3 [superscript]A-&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)-N&#8217;-(6 [superscript]A -deoxy-6 [superscript]A -&#946;-cyclodextrinyl)urea, 36&#946;CD&#8322;ur, has been prepared.

The factors affecting the variations in these data are discussed. The enantioselectivity of substituted &#946;CDs 6 [superscript]A -[bis (carboxylatomethyl)amino]-6 [superscript]A -deoxy-&#946;-cyclodextrin (6&#946;CDidaH&#8322;) and (2 [superscript]A S,3 [superscript]A S)-3 [superscript]A -[bis(carboxylatomethyl)amino]-3[superscript]A -deoxy-&#946;-cyclodextrin (3&#946;CDidaH&#8322;) and 6 [superscript]A -[tris(carboxylatomethyl)(2- aminoethyl)amino]-6 [superscript]A -deoxy-&#946;-cyclodextrin (6&#946;CDedtaH&#8323;) and their Eu&#179; &#8314;  complexes in forming host-guest complexes with six enantiomeric guests in D&#8322;O was studied by 1D and 2D &#185;H NMR (600 MHz) spectroscopy. The guests are D/L-tryptophanate (Trp&#8315;), 4-hydroxyl-D/L-phenylglycinate (4HOPhg&#8315;), D/L-histidinate (His&#8315;), D/L-pheniramine (Phm), D/L-phenylglycinate (Phg&#8315;) and (D/L)-&#946;-phenylserinate (&#946;Phs&#8315;). Enantioselective host-guest complexation was observed between the [Eu(6&#946;CDida)]&#8314; , [Eu(3&#946;CDida)]&#8314;  and [Eu(6&#946;CDedta)] complexes and Trp&#8315;, [Eu(6&#946;CDida)]&#8314;  and [Eu(3&#946;CDida)]&#8314;  and 4HOPhg&#8315;, and &#946;CD, 6&#946;CDida&#178;&#8315;, 3&#946;CDida&#178;&#8315;, 6&#946;CDedta&#179;&#8315; and the Eu&#179;&#8314;complexes of the three substituted &#946;CDs and Phm. The His&#8315;, Phg&#8315; and &#946;Phs&#8315; enantiomers showed no evidence for selective host-guest complexation. The preparation of 3&#946;CDidaH&#8322; and 6&#946;CDedtaH&#8323; and the determination of their pK[subscript]a s are also reported. In collaboration with the research group of Prof. Matthew A.

Related to this, the cleavage of POMC to ACTH by the enzyme, prohormone convertase 1 (PC1), may be influenced by corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Accumulating evidence suggests that the capacity of individual corticotrophs to process POMC to ACTH may vary and individual corticotrophs are differentially responsive to CRH. It is not known, however, if there are separate corticotroph subpopulations in the fetal sheep pituitary which can be identified by differential colocalisation of POMC, ACTH and the CRH receptor 1, CRHR&#8321;, nor if changes in the relative proportions of such subpopulations play a role in the molecular mechanisms underlying the overall changes in pituitary function described previously during gestation and in response to suboptimal uterine environments. To investigate these hypotheses, it was first necessary to develop novel methods for the simultaneous immunohistochemical labelling of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual cells on sections of fetal sheep pituitary. In addition, I developed and validated an automated method to categorise and count individual cells to increase the quantitative power of this study. Pituitary tissue was collected from control fetuses at 53-55 (n=6), 63-85 (n=6), 110 (n=4), 139-141 (n=4) and 144-145 (n=6) days gestation. Two animal models, known to alter pituitary function in the fetal sheep, were used to investigate corticotrophic adaptations to suboptimal uterine environments. For the maternal periconceptional undernutrition (PCUN) model, maternal feed was reduced to 70% of maintenance requirements from at least 45 days before to 7 days after mating and fetal tissues were collected at 53-55 days gestation (n=7). For the placental restriction (PR) model, the majority of the placental attachment sites were removed in five ewes before mating and fetal tissues were collected at 140 (n=4) and 144 (n=4) days gestation. Pituitary sections were simultaneously labelled with antisera raised against full length POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; and the proportions of pituitary cells with combinations of antisera were quantified. Four subpopulations of corticotrophs were identified, which expressed either: POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, ACTH+CRHR&#8321;, POMC+ CRHR&#8321; or POMConly. There was a significant decrease in the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; between 53-55 and 65-85 days gestation, before an increase at 110 days gestation and a further marked decrease between 139-141 and 144-145 days gestation. In fetuses from the PCUN group, the proportion of pituitary cells expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; in early gestation was reduced. PR resulted in a significantly higher proportion of corticotrophs expressing POMC+ACTH+CRHR&#8321; during the prepartum period. This work represents the discovery of the differential expression of POMC, ACTH and CRHR&#8321; in individual corticotrophs of the fetal sheep pituitary and the first insights into the pituitary adaptations to periconceptional nutrient restriction and placental restriction at the level of individual corticotrophs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">endocrinology; ontogeny; fetal origins of adult disease; periconceptional undernutrition; placental restriction; immunohistochemistry; image analysis</field><field name="subject">Sheep Fetuses Physiology.</field><field name="subject">Pituitary gland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Violence in the emergency department: an ethnographic study.</field><field name="creator">Lau, Bee Chuo</field><field name="description">Background Violence in the emergency department (ED) is a significant problem and it is increasing. Several studies have shown that violence in the ED is more likely to occur within the first hour of a patient&#8217;s presentation. Therefore, it is possible that there are some indicators of violence observable during the initial nurse-patient/relative interaction at triage. Nevertheless the problem remains inadequately investigated as many incidents are not reported and most studies that have investigated this issue are descriptive in nature. Although these studies have provided important preliminary information, they fail to reveal the complexities of the problem, in particular the cultural aspects of violence which are crucial for the ED. Aims The main aims of this study were to explore the cultural aspects of violence in the ED and to determine the possible indicators of violence at triage. Methodology Contemporary ethnography based on interpretive and post-positive paradigms was adopted to frame the methodology of this study. Methods This study was carried out at a major metropolitan ED over three months. The data collection techniques included field observations, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. The data analysis framework adopted for this study incorporated Spradley's (1980) and LeCompte and Schensul's (1999) approaches. Findings The study indicated that the cultural meanings of violence were complex and highly subjective with variations among nurses which in turn influenced their responses to violence (e.g. reporting or not reporting an incident). The cultural meanings were sometimes contradictory and confusing as violence could be seen as both a challenge and a threat or predictable and unpredictable. The same type of behaviour from one individual could be perceived as violent but not for another. Many nurses perceived that violence was unpredictable and inevitable but the study demonstrated that there were indicators of violence which could be used to predict and prevent the problem. Factors such as environment, conflicting messages regarding waiting time, and patients' expectations and needs played an important part in violence. Besides, there were immediate warning signs of violence such as the overt verbal (e.g. mumbling or shouting) and covert nonverbal signs (e.g. staring or agitation). This study showed that patients' behaviours for instance being unfriendly, not appreciative, inattentive and uncooperative were better predictors of violence in the ED than their traits or problems alone. However, nurse-patient/relative behaviours and the resulting reciprocal relationship were considered central in determining if violence would occur or be avoided. Nurses' efforts to establish rapport with patients was crucial in minimising violence and needed to occur early. There was usually a &#8216;turning point&#8217; that provided an opportunity for the nurse to avoid violence. Nurses&#8217; behaviours at the &#8216;turning point&#8217; strongly influence the outcome. Nurses' awareness of their personal expectations, prejudices and ethnocentrisms were the pivotal points in preventing escalation of violence. Conclusion This study has provided a more comprehensive and sophisticated understanding of the cultural aspects of violence in the ED. While violence is a complex issue with many paradoxes, there are lessons to be learned. The study indicates that effective interpersonal empathetic communication has a significant role in reducing violence in the ED.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">violence; aggression; assault; abuse; hospital</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of topical antifibrinolytics and a novel chitosan gel on haemostasis and wound healing in endoscopic sinus surgery.</field><field name="creator">Athanasiadis, Theodore</field><field name="description">Introduction: Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is at present the gold standard therapeutic modality for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) resistant to medical therapy. Whilst results from ESS for CRS are generally good, postoperative bleeding and impaired wound healing with adhesion formation remains a concern. Due to patient discomfort and the detrimental effects on wound healing caused by most packing materials, many surgeons no longer routinely use nasal packing. Surgeons have in the past sought agents which would provide post-operative haemostasis without detrimentally affecting wound healing. Antifibrinolytics have been available for many years, however, their topical application has only been explored in the last few years. Recently different forms of chitosan have separately shown significant promise as powerful haemostatic and anti-adhesion agents. The aim of this thesis was to explore the progressive understanding of the interaction between haemostasis and wound healing with possible development of a novel agent. Methods: The first step to scientifically assess bleeding after sinus surgery was to develop a standardised method of video endoscopy and grading the surgical field during ESS. This was done as a multinational collaborative trial. Once this assessment tool was validated a randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of two antifibrinolytics (epsilon aminocaproic acid and tranexamic acid) was conducted. Further evaluation was then conducted on other possible hemostatic and antiadhesion substances. This included various combinations of a novel chitosan gel. These gels were trialled in vitro to determine their effect on human nasal fibroblasts derived from CRS patients. Fibroblast adhesion and proliferation as well as closure of standardised wounds were studied. The most promising of these gels was then used in an in vivo sheep model. Once effectiveness of the chitosan-dextran gel was shown in the laboratory, this was evaluated against a number of currently available hemostatic and anti-adhesion substances in a standardised model of wound healing in sheep with CRS. This model had been previously extensively validated in our department. Full thickness mucosal injuries were created on the lateral nasal wall and ethmoids of twenty sheep and recombinant tissue factor (rTF), SprayGel or Chitosan-Dextran derivative gel applied topically in a randomized fashion. Adhesion formation and severity as well as microscopic wound healing and ciliary function were analysed at day 28, 56, 84 and 112 post initial surgery. A further sheep study was conducted applying chitosan dextran gel to standardised mucosal injuries and comparing its effect on the control of bleeding to control. Bleeding time and grade were recorded and wound healing monitored via serial videoendoscopy over two weeks and objectively measured. Results: a) Assessment of the bleeding scales showed that inter and intra observer reliability for both scales tested were significantly improved by employing a standardized video-endoscopy technique. The Wormald scale proved to be more reliable and sensitive to changes in the most common surgical fields encountered in ESS. b) Tranexamic acid showed a modest but clinically significant improvement in the surgical field at 2, 4 and 6 minutes after application. Epsilon aminocaproic acid did not effectively improve the surgical field. c) Nasal fibroblast adhesion and proliferation were significantly impaired with dextran and chitosan. The most effective ratio that delayed but did not prevent wound closure were 5 % chitosan: 5 % dextran gel. d) In a standardised sheep model of mucosal wound healing the chitosan gel significantly decreased lateral nasal wall and ethmoidal adhesions at all time points. The chitosan group had a significantly greater percentage of re-epithelialisation and reciliation than control and rTF. In addition the mean cilial grade in the chitosan group was significantly better than control. e) The chitosan dextran gel was significantly more haemostatic at 2,4, and 6 minutes after injury with no significant difference noted in wound healing. Conclusions: Standardised methods of videoendoscopy and grading the surgical field in ESS are valuable tools for further research. Tranexamic acid significantly improved the surgical field to a moderate degree in ESS compared to control. Chitosan gel is a promising new powerful haemostatic bio-polymer which has a mild inhibitory effect on fibroblast attachment and proliferation. This may partially explain the significant improvement in microscopic wound healing and reduction in adhesion formation seen in a sheep model of chronic sinusitis. Future work evaluating this gel in the setting of a human trial is currently underway.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">haemostasis; wound healing; chitosan; sinus surgery; antifibrinolytics; surgical field; tronexamic acid</field><field name="subject">Nasal mucosa Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Endoscopic surgery</field><field name="subject">Wound healing Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmacology of the CIC-1 chloride channel.</field><field name="creator">Aromataris, Edoardo Claudio</field><field name="description">Clinical studies reported side effects of muscular spasms and muscle stiffness following the administration of clofibrate, a drug once used to treat hyperlipidaemia in patients. Experiments with clofibrate and its analogues in animal models showed it produced these myotonic symptoms in muscle by reducing the chloride conductance of the muscle membrane. The effects of 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid, an analogue of clofibric acid, was assessed on the rat ClC-1 channel (rClC-1). Racemic 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid shifted the voltage dependence of rClC-1 activation to more depolarising potentials, a mechanism accounting for myotonic symptoms previously reported. Experiments with resolved enantiomers revealed that the effects recorded were due exclusively to S-(&#8211;) 2-(4- chlorophenoxy)propionic acid. The R-(+) enantiomer was ineffective at the concentrations tested. Further experiments with the compound at differing Cl- concentrations in the extracellular solution suggested that S-(&#8211;) 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid altered the gating of ClC-1 by decreasing the affinity of the binding site where Cl- normally acts to &#8216;gate&#8217; the channel. Similarities in the effects reported for most dominant mutations in the CLCN1 gene that lead to myotonia congenita and 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid prompted experiments that introduced these point mutations in the human ClC-1 (hClC-1) gene to compare their mode of action to that of the drug. These mutations, F307S and A313T, predominantly altered the slow, or common, gate of the channel. Conversely, the effect of 2-(4-chlorophenoxy)propionic acid was predominantly on the fast gating process of hClC-1. A macroscopically similar effect therefore, can be produced by two different modes of action. Results suggested that both drug and mutations exert their action by affecting the transition of the channel from its closed to open state subsequent to Cl- binding. Investigation of the interaction between rClC-1 gating and a further 25 compounds structurally related to clofibric acid identified a number of compounds effective at shifting the open probability of fast gating to depolarising potentials. Fewer were identified that influence slow gating. Some compounds affected both gating processes, however, none were identified which influenced slow gating alone. Ability to displace the voltage dependent activation of the fast gate appeared to depend largely on the lipophilicity of the molecules tested, indicating the importance of hydrophobic interactions between drug and channel protein.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">muscle chloride channel, CIC-1; 2-(4-chlorophenoxy); propionic acid; CPP; whole-cell patch-clamp; myotonia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transnational energy projects and green politics in Thailand and Burma : a critical approach to activism and security.</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Adam</field><field name="description">Most studies in environmental politics have traditionally examined three broad areas: the degradation of the environment; the regulatory regimes governing the environment; or environmental activism within the affluent North. This thesis provides an alternative perspective, exploring environmental activism in the less affluent South. In particular, while human rights and social justice perspectives have historically been largely absent from many environmental movements of the North, this thesis argues that, due to precarious living conditions and authoritarian governance, these issues are of primary importance for environmentalists in the South. As a result this thesis contends that most environmental movements in the South are part of a growing global justice movement and that important cultural diversities within this movement can result in novel forms of resistance and environmental governance. The focus here is on the emancipatory actors within these movements in the South who challenge existing power structures within society. Likewise, by adopting a critical perspective, this thesis argues that large business interests pursue energy projects in the South in the name of energy security and large scale industrial development that are often inappropriate for local development and security needs. To test these hypotheses, four case studies were undertaken that examine transnational gas pipeline and large dam projects at various stages of their development which originate in either Burma (Myanmar) or Thailand. Empirical research, primarily in the form of interviews, undertaken in the countries hosting the various energy projects demonstrated that although environmental activists in the South were assisted by transnational activist networks there were also important local factors that impacted on the emancipatory philosophies, strategies and tactics of many activists in this region. These strategies have achieved some success, with environmental impact assessment (EIA) processes in Thailand now providing a potential opening for the political engagement of communities. Nevertheless, this thesis finds that the power of corporate interests in the international political economy often poses insurmountable barriers for activists to achieve both their short and long term aims. The findings suggest that despite the efforts of activists, local indigenous and ethnic minority communities continue to bear the brunt of the social and environmental costs of transnational energy projects in the South while receiving few of the benefits. Rather than safeguarding these communities from deprivation, these projects often exacerbate existing social tensions and conflicts, resulting in increased community insecurity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand; Burma; energy security; environmental politics; environmental activism; environmental security</field><field name="subject">Green movement</field><field name="subject">Thailand Politics and government 21st century.</field><field name="subject">Burma Politics and government 21st century.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of the chemokines CXCL12 and CXCL16 in breast cancer.</field><field name="creator">Hampton-Smith, Sharon</field><field name="description">A growing body of work implicates chemokines and their receptors in the progression of various types of cancer, including breast cancer. However, as potent chemotactic factors for leukocytes, chemokines also have the potential to enhance anti-cancer immunity. Evidence suggests that the chemokine CXCL12 and its receptors may be important in a number of aspects of breast cancer progression and site-specific metastasis. Another chemokine, CXCL16, has been identified as a specific chemotactic factor for Type Ipolarised T lymphocytes, which are major effectors of cell-mediated immunity and hence efficacious anti-tumour immune responses. The aim of this study, therefore, was to further elucidate the roles of CXCL12 and CXCL16 in breast cancer development and metastasis. To achieve this, wild-type CXCL12 and CXCL16 and antagonists of CXCL12 and CXCL16 activity, CXCL12[subscript](P2G) and CXCL16[subscript](9-220) respectively, were overexpressed in the 4T1.2 mouse model of breast carcinoma. Overexpression of wild-type CXCL12 potently inhibited both primary tumour growth and metastasis in this model. This was attributed to the induction of an anti-tumour response dependent, in part, on T cells, interferon-g and the cytotoxic mediators perforin and TRAIL. This response was characterised by increased numbers of CD11c&#8314; cells in the tumour-draining lymph nodes and enhanced cytolytic activity of lymph node-derived effector cells against tumour cells. Unexpectedly, CXCL12[subscript](P2G) inhibited metastasis of tumour cells to the lungs of tumour-bearing mice, without affecting primary tumour growth. Intravenous injection of tumour cells revealed that CXCL12[subscript](P2G) expression could block metastatic steps occurring post tumour cell escape from the primary tumour, though a role for CXCL12([subscript](P2G) at earlier metastatic steps could not be ruled out. Further work is needed to clarify the precise stages of metastasis at which CXCL12[subscript](P2G) exerts its effects. No obvious effects on primary breast tumour growth were observed when CXCL16 or CXCL16([subscript](9-220) were overexpressed in tumour cells. Interestingly, CXCL16[subscript](9-220) expression inhibited experimental metastasis but not spontaneous metastasis. The findings of this study begin to shed light on the roles of CXCL12 and CXCL16 in breast cancer progression and also highlight the potential therapeutic applications of CXCL12, CXCL16 and/or their antagonists in the treatment of breast cancer and breast cancer metastasis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemokines; breast cancer; CXCL12; CXCL16</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of measurement-based load and QoS management in a distributed audio environment.</field><field name="creator">Kinghorn, Mathew W.</field><field name="description">Recently, Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) have received significant popularity. Made up of populations of physically distributed players, MMOGs provide user immersion into the playing environment through realistic graphics and sound. However, many lack real-time communication between users, relying upon text-based and simple VoIP systems. The Immersive Audio Communications for Massively Multiplayer Games (IACMMG) and Dense Interactive Communications Environment (DICE) projects, currently being developed by the Smart Internet Technologies CRC, aim to change this by providing realistic two dimensional voice communications. As MMOGs cater for a global audience, the projects are designed to utilise a network of audio processing servers to which users are connected for the purposes of communication. These projects face a number of challenges, two of which we address in this thesis. The first is concerned with the finite resources of each server and is thus a question of how to effectively balance user load over the available audio servers. The second problem is concerned with ensuring that users receive acceptable audio Quality of Service (QoS). In order to address the first problem, a load balancing architecture is proposed. Four load balancing algorithms are designed and implemented and their respective trengths and weaknesses explored.  To address the second problem, we explore how QoS should be defined in an MMOG context. The IACMMG and DICE projects are VoIP based, thus QoS is primarily dependent upon packet delay and loss. We explore techniques for information gathering from packet traffic and use it for equating perceived QoS. This leads to the development of a QoS algorithm designed to measure the QoS of conversations within the virtual environment of the MMOG, reacting to the perceived level of QoS, and moving users to servers capable of providing higher levels of QoS should this be necessary. The load balancing and QoS aspects of the IACMMG and DICE projects are dependent upon one another, and thus we are left with a problem of two potentially conflicting objectives. To address this we integrate the two architectures, modifying each to make it compatible with the other. The culmination is a complete architecture capable of both load and QoS management.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational aspects of generalized continua based on moving least square approximations.</field><field name="creator">Skatulla, Sebastian</field><field name="description">In recent years, current engineering technology lead to a renewed interest in generalized  continuum theories. In particular, generalized continua are able to address fundamental physical phenomena which are related to the underlying microstructure of the material. Specifically scale-effects are of special interest. In this work a generalized deformation formulation is developed which allows to incorporate material information from the microscopic and the macroscopic space into an unified constitutive model. The approach is based on a theory developed by Sansour (1998) which was originated in theoretical considerations of Ericksen and Truesdell (1957) and later on Eringen and his co-workers (Eringen 1999). The basic idea is to construct a generalized continuum consisting of macro- and micro-continuum and subsequently to compose the generalized deformation by a macro- and micro-component. This procedure results in a generalized problem formulation. Furthermore, new strain measures as well as corresponding field equations can be identified. Here, it is assumed that the deformation field can only be varied within the macro-continuum so that the balance equations are established for the macro-space. The constitutive law is defined at the microscopic level and the geometrical specification of the micro-continuum is the only material input which goes beyond those needed in a classical description. A special detail of this approach is that it involves first order strain gradients which are expressed by second order derivatives of the field. It allows to address relative motion between micro- and macro-space without adding extra degrees of freedom. In order to model this formulation this work makes use of a meshfree method based on moving least squares (MLS) which is able to provide the required higher order continuity (Lancaster and Salkauskas 1981). Examples of meshfree methods are the diffuse element method (Nayroles, Touzot, and Villon 1992), the element-free Galerkin method (Belytschko, Lu and Gu 1994), the reproducing kernel particle method (Liu and Chen, 1995), the partition of unity method (Melenk and Babuska 1997) and the hp-cloud method (Duarte and Oden 1996), just to name a few. It was demonstrated that these kind of methods can deal especially well with problems which are characterized by large deformation or changing domain geometry. The potential in modelling formulations involving higher order derivatives has not been widely recognized yet, with the exception of a few one- respectively two-dimensional case studies (Tang et al., 2003). This work now aims to illustrate the excellent applicability of the proposed generalized deformation formulation in combination with MLS by modelling elastic and plastic problems which are proven to exhibit size-scale effects (Yang and Lakes 1981 ; Fleck et al. 1994 ; Aifantis 1999 ; Lam et al. 2003). Furthermore, a large-scale case study on underground excavation design reveals the potential and adaptivity of this theory with respect to heterogeneous material such as rock.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic sequence stratigraphy of the intra-Barrow Group, Barrow Sub-basin, Northwest Shelf, Australia.</field><field name="creator">King, Emma Jean</field><field name="description">Regional exploration in the Barrow Sub-basin has dominantly focused on structural traps in the Top Barrow Group. A lack of recent discoveries has focused attention more towards the economic potential of the Early Cretaceous intra-Barrow Group plays. The aim of this study was to interpret the seismic sequence stratigraphy and depositional history of the intra-Barrow Group within the Barrow Sub-basin, with emphasis on the identification of stratigraphic traps and potential locations of economic seal/reservoir couplets within the study area. The study area lies south of Barrow Island, and contains the topsets, foresets and toesets of the &#8216;Barrow delta&#8217;, which are an amalgamation of Mesozoic sandprone fluvial, coastal deltaic and deepwater successions. The final stages of the break-up of Gondwana impacted on the structural development of the Barrow Sub-basin, when a large shelf-margin fluvial/deltaic system built out toward the north to northeast, contributing to northerly shelf margin accretion, with largescale clinoform features and associated depositional environments. The dataset comprises the Flinders 3D seismic survey 1267 km&#178; and 35 well logs. Eleven seismic sequences are identified and a seismic sequence stratigraphic framework tied to the wells has been developed, via detailed sequence stratigraphic mapping, integrated with 3D visualisation techniques with the use of Petrel. These eleven second-order sequences are further subdivided into lowstand, transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The movement of the palaeo-shelf break, slope and base of slope can be traced throughout each sequence, displaying an overall trend of building out in a north to northeast direction. A series of palaeo- geographic maps for each sequence has been developed to illustrate the basin&#8217;s evolution. The seismic sequences identified display progradation, followed by aggradation, then downstepping, concluding with progradation and aggradation. A high-resolution sequence stratigraphic study of Seismic Sequence 1 showed that several higher-order sequences can be identified, including numerous lowstand systems wedges, along with associated channel features, which could be targeted as new plays. The sequence stratigraphic framework developed, palaeo-geographic reconstructions and all other interpretations made for this project have been integrated to assess the prospectivity of the intra-Barrow Group over the study area, resulting in the identification of a number of leads and prospectivity summaries for each of the 11 Seismic Sequences identified within the intra-Barrow Group.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seismic sequence stratigraphy; sequence stratigraphy, Barrow Group; Barrow Sub-basin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of ANKRD11 and FBXO31: two candidate tumour suppressor genes from the 16q24.3 breast cancer loss of heterozygosity region.</field><field name="creator">Neilsen, Paul Matthew</field><field name="description">Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the long arm of chromosome 16 is frequently observed during the onset of breast cancer. Our laboratory has recently identified both ANKRD11 and FBXO31 as candidate tumour suppressor genes in the chromosome band 16q24.3, which is the smallest region of overlap for breast cancer LOH. This thesis focuses on the functional analysis of these two novel genes and implicates a role for them as breast cancer tumour suppressors. ANKRD11: a novel p53 coactivator involved in the rescue of mutant p53. The ability of p53 to act as a transcription factor is critical for its function as a tumour suppressor. Ankyrin repeat domain 11 (ANKRD11) was found to be a novel p53-interacting protein which enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53. ANKRD11 expression in breast cancer cell lines was shown to be down-regulated when compared to ANKRD11 expression in finite life-span HMECs and non-malignant immortalized breast epithelial cells. Restoration of ANKRD11 expression in MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) and MDA-MB-468 (p53[superscript R273H] mutant) cells suppressed the oncogenic properties of these breast cancer cell lines through enhancement of p21[superscript waf1] expression. ShRNA-mediated silencing of ANKRD11 reduced the ability of p53 to activate p21[superscript waf1] expression in response to DNA damage. ANKRD11 was shown to associate with the p53 acetyltransferase, P/CAF, and exogenous ANKRD11 expression increased the levels of acetylated p53. Exogenous ANKRD11 expression enhanced the DNA-binding properties of the p53[superscript R273H] mutant to the CDKN1A promoter, implicating a role for ANKRD11 in the restoration of mutant p53[superscript R273H] function. These findings demonstrate a role for ANKRD11 as a p53 coactivator and illustrate the potential of ANKRD11 in the restoration of mutant p53[superscript R273H] function. ANKRD11 has roles beyond that of p53 coactivation. This thesis also presents preliminary findings to suggest that ANKRD11 may be involved in the regulation of eukaryotic cell division. Furthermore, ANKRD11 was shown to function as an estrogen receptor coactivator. Taken together, these finding suggest that ANKRD11 is a multi-functional cancer-related protein. FBXO31: the 16q24.3 senescence gene. A BAC located in the 16q24.3 breast cancer loss of heterozygosity region was previously shown to restore cellular senescence when transferred into breast tumour cell lines. We have shown that FBXO31, although located just distal to this BAC, can induce cellular senescence in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and is the likely candidate senescence gene. Exogenous FBXO31 expression inhibited the oncogenic properties of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. In addition, compared to the relative expression in normal breast, levels of FBXO31 were down-regulated in breast tumour cell lines and primary tumours. FBXO31 protein levels were cell cycle regulated, with maximal expression from late G2 to early G1 phase. Ectopic expression of FBXO31 in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 resulted in the accumulation of cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. FBXO31 was also shown to be a component of a SCF ubiquitination complex. We propose that FBXO31 functions as a tumour suppressor by generating SCF[superscript FBXO31] complexes that target particular substrates, critical for the normal execution of the cell cycle, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast cancer; loss of heterozygosity; tumour suppessor genes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass loading and Stokes number effects in steady and unsteady particle-laden jets.</field><field name="creator">Foreman, Richard J.</field><field name="description">In single phase, steady, turbulent axisymmetric jets, the time-averaged velocity field can be characterised by the decay in centreline velocity and increased spread with increasing distance from the jet orifice. In a two-phase or &#8216;particle-laden&#8217; jet, the particles will modulate the jet turbulence and exchange momentum with the gas phase. Consequently, these effects reduce both the centreline velocity decay and spreading rates with respect to the single-phase jet. Empirical exponential scaling factors were found by previous authors to describe the reduced centreline decay and spreading rates well for low Stokes numbers. In this thesis, power-law scaling factors are found to scale well a wide range of centreline velocity decay and spreading rate data published over the past 40 years, for a wide range of Stokes numbers. The power-law scaling is composed of three different regimes. For low Stokes numbers St&#8320;   &#8818;20, it is found that the gas phase centreline velocity, u&#8320;/uc collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;, and the velocity profile half widths r&#8321;/ &#8322; collapse if plotted as a function of x/D(1+&#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;. Here, u&#8320; is the exit velocity, &#216;&#8320; is the exit mass loading, x is the axial coordinate and D is the pipe diameter. For intermediate Stokes numbers, u&#8320;/uc collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185; and r&#8321;/ &#8322; collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;/&#178;. For high Stokes numbers St&#8320; &#8819; 200, u&#8320;/uc collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;/&#178; and the half width is approximately independent of &#216;&#8320;. In addition to the velocity of the gas phase, other aspects of particle- laden jets are found to be amenable to scaling by power-law functions. It is found that reported solid phase mass flux data scales similarly to gas phase measurements. Limited solid phase concentration and entrainment measurements reported in the literature are also found to scale by power-law functions. Whereas that limited data was obtained from the literature, measurements of the distribution of particles in particle-laden jets were conducted to further assess the validity of the scaling regimes to the solid phase. A planar light scattering technique is conducted to measure the distribution of particles in an axisymmetric jet and their subsequent scaling (or lack thereof) are reported for a variation in &#216;&#8320;, Stokes number and gas phase jet exit density. For Stokes numbers based on the pipe friction velocity St* &#8320;   &#8764; 1, half widths of particle distributions were found to scale with x/D(1+&#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;/&#178; . The apparent centreline concentration was found to be independent of &#216;&#8320; at this same St* &#8320; . For Stokes numbers based on the pipe friction velocity St*&#8320; &lt; 1, half widths are independent of &#216;&#8320;. The effect of the other parameters, i.e. Stokes number and density ratio, on centreline distributions and half widths are also investigated. Measurements of particle distributions, delivered via an annular channel, in a triangular oscillating jet (OJ) flow are also reported for a variation in momentum ratio, the ratio of OJ momentum to channel momentum and mass loading. The results of the variation in momentum ratio on particle distributions are compared with an existing precessing jet (PJ) study. It is the aim of this study to determine the experimental conditions for which the OJ nozzle is superior to the PJ nozzle. The use of an OJ nozzle is preferable at an industrial scale by virtue of its lower driving pressure compared with a PJ nozzle. It is found that particle distributions in a PJ flow spread at a greater rate with increasing momentum ratio compared with the spread of particles in an OJ flow. However, at momentum ratios approximately less than unity, the absolute spread from an OJ is greater. This also corresponds to nozzle driving pressure less than approximately 10kPA. For an increase in mass loading, the spread of particle distribution in the OJ decreases and recirculation increases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiphase flow; turbulent jet; particle-laden jet; two-phase jet; precessing jet; triangular-oscillating jet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of tartrate stabilisation technologies for wine industry.</field><field name="creator">Low, Lin Lin.</field><field name="description">In the Australian wine industry, cold stabilisation is a widely used industrial process to prevent tartrate instability in bottled wines. This process involves cooling the wine close to its freezing point for extended periods, thereby inducing tartrate precipitation. However, it has several important disadvantages. Consequently, alternative methods to cold stabilisation have been developed. This includes electrodialysis, nanofiltration and contact processes. In this study, current knowledge regarding performance and cost of cold stabilisation and alternative technologies for tartrate stabilisation is reviewed. Whilst there have been occasional cost comparisons between cold stabilisation and alternative technologies, existing data is not suitable for properly evaluating the relative economics of the different process options. Therefore, alternative technologies to cold stabilisation, including the Westfalia process, nanofiltration and electrodialysis were compared for both technical and economic performance. Berri Estates Winery was used as the basis for engineering calculations and conceptual cost estimates. This is the first time that such a comprehensive evaluation has been undertaken of a broad range of alternative technologies for tartrate stabilisation during wine production. Product loss was a key cost driver in differentiating tartrate stabilisation processes. Cold stabilisation was found to be the most economic treatment process irrespective of scale or winery size. The Westfalia process and nanofiltration were the next most cost effective options. Data for economic evaluation and environmental assessment were summarised in a survey form that was circulated to technical experts from Hardy Wine Company, the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) and the University of Adelaide. The purpose of the survey was to obtain the experts&#8217; opinions on the merits of the alternative technologies. The results of this survey were used for comparison between current cold stabilisation and alternative technologies, by performing multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This represents an original application of MCDA techniques to decision making in the wine industry. The MCDA analysis identified a strong preference by experts for nanofiltration combined with centrifugation as an alternative to cold stabilisation. As a consequence, laboratory investigations and field testing of nanofiltration were conducted to obtain new and practical information which was not presently available and relevant to understanding and implementing this process for tartrate stabilisation of wine. The laboratory experiments were performed with a range of membranes and tartrate unstable wines (i.e. Semillon, Colombard and Shiraz) using a purpose-designed laboratory-scale continuously-stirred batch-test membrane cell. The results showed that a range of commercial nanofiltration membranes with a nominal molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) between 200 and 500 Daltons (Da) were able to achieve tartrate stabilisation of all wines tested. This was achieved at moderate pressures less than 20 bar with a recovery of at least 50 %. It was also observed that seeding of wine following nanofiltration might reduce the holding time required to achieve stability and also enable reductions in the recovery rate to values of less than 50 %. The field testing was performed at Berri Estates Winery in the Riverland region of South Australia. The testing was performed using an existing commercial membrane system. This membrane system was already used for juice/wine concentration. The nanofiltration membranes had a nominal MWCO of 300 Da. The testing was conducted on Colombard and Shiraz wines. The field tests confirmed that nanofiltration could successfully tartrate stabilise Colombard and Shiraz wines at recoveries of 50 %; without seeding; within relatively short holding periods of less than four hours; and at flux rates between 5 and 10 L/m&#178;/h. Crystallisation kinetics were also studied. At low recovery, the crystallisation was initially controlled by diffusion step, then surface integration. However, at high recovery, the crystallisation was controlled solely by surface integration. Sensory testing (by duo-trio difference tests) produced adverse sensory outcomes when compared with treatment of the same wines by cold stabilisation. Unfortunately, it could not be established whether this problem was inherent to the process or arose from unrelated factors. Setting aside the adverse sensory result, this is the first time that technical feasibility of nanofiltration for tartrate stabilisation has been successfully demonstrated. Further field testing and sensory evaluation of nano-filtered wines should be carried out to verify the effect of nanofiltration on wines. If the process is successful and favourable, the process design for implementation of a production scale nanofiltration for tartrate stabilisation should then be optimised.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cold stabilisation; electrodialysis; nanofiltration; multi-criteria analysis; MCDA; sensory analysis; economic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acacia saligna as a sustainable agroforestry crop for southern Australia: a genetic assessment.</field><field name="creator">Millar, Melissa Ann</field><field name="description">Acacia saligna is a native species complex with a widespread natural distribution throughout the south west of Western Australia. It is being developed as an agroforestry crop to produce low value, bulk biomass products in the low rainfall agricultural areas of southern Australia. This thesis develops knowledge to assist the domestication and breeding program of A. saligna as an agroforestry cultivar. It also furthers development of a risk management plan for utilisation of the Acacia saligna species complex.  Highly informative microsatellite markers for A. saligna were developed for use in mating system studies, paternity analysis and in the development of a diagnostic tool for the identification of individuals and populations at the subspecific level. Microsatellites developed in other Acacia species were also screened for utility in A. saligna. A high level of outcrossing (mean multilocus outcrossing rate of 0.98) and little true selfing was found for a planted stand of A. saligna subspecies saligna. Paternity analysis indicated heterogeneity in pollen clouds experienced by maternal trees and an essentially random pattern of mating within the stand. Inter-subspecific pollen immigration into the stand from trees of subspecies lindleyi was detected for 14% of progeny analysed and occurred over distances greater than 1500 m. Extensive intra-subspecific pollen-mediated gene flow is maintained between remnant natural populations of A. saligna subspecies lindleyi, and a high level of inter-subspecific pollen immigration from trees in the planted stand of A. saligna subspecies saligna was detected in remnant populations of subspecies lindleyi (32% of analysed progeny) occurring over distances greater than 1500 m.  Polymorphic microsatellite markers used to investigate genetic structuring within A. saligna revealed a high level of genetic divergence between subspecific entities congruent with a taxonomic reclassification of the species complex. Selected microsatellite markers also proved suitable for use as a rapid diagnostic tool that can be used to characterise populations into one of the proposed subspecies of A. saligna with high probability.  These results indicate that high levels of outcrossing and essentially random patterns of mating that maintain genetic diversity in seed crops should be achievable with the suitable management of seed production stands of A. saligna. Appropriate management techniques that limit genetic contamination into seed production stands will need to be employed to achieve this goal. Management techniques will also be required to minimise the risk of genetic contamination from stands planted for agroforestry purposes into remnant natural populations. Isolation distances greater than 1500 m between genetically divergent agroforestry crops and natural populations are suggested in both cases and key areas of further research are suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acacia saligna; agroforestry; risk assessment; gene flow; microsatellite; diagnostic markers; paternity analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59017</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Actions of seminal fluid signalling factors in the female reproductive tract and on pregnancy outcome.</field><field name="creator">Glynn, Danielle Jannette</field><field name="description">The cytokine environment of early pregnancy is known to be a key determinant of the development of the pre-implantation embryo, and its subsequent implantation and growth. Factors in male seminal fluid have been identified as regulators of the expression of cytokines in the female tract of mice, humans and other mammalian species, with insemination eliciting a cascade of molecular and cellular events, reminiscent of a classic inflammatory response. In humans, perturbations in seminal fluid signalling have been proposed to predispose to pathologies of pregnancy including implantation failure, recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia. Seminal transforming growth factor-beta (TGF&#946;) is identified as one key molecule present in seminal fluid responsible for inducing the female post-mating cytokine response in mice. Research in humans however, has shown the seminal TGF&#946; content of fertile versus infertile couples to be similar, while the content of other known seminal constituents such as interferon-gamma (IFN&#947;), correlate with reproductive success. This project aimed to investigate the nature of active factors present in seminal fluid in mice, and their interactions in regulating the uterine cytokine environment during early pregnancy, utilising a variety of in vitro and in vivo experimental strategies. Further, the effect of perturbation in the peri-conception cytokine environment on short and long term pregnancy and postnatal outcomes was investigated. Evaluation of uterine fluids from estrous and mated mice showed a marked upregulation of a number of cytokines following mating, including granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the chemokine KC (rodent IL-8 homologue). Increased production of factors such as GM-CSF and subsequent generation of a receptive uterine environment is thought to be crucial for optimal embryo development and placentation. It has previously been shown that seminal factors such as TGF&#946; contribute to the uterine post-mating inflammatory response, however other moieties present in seminal fluid, for instance cytokines induced in response to infection such as IFN&#947; or products from the mucosal microflora, may also play a regulatory role. Using uterine epithelial cells cultured in vitro, it was shown that a variety of immune modulators including the cytokines TGF&#946; and IFN&#947;, as well as bacterial products, gram negative lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and gram positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA), can alter basal cytokine production. IFN&#947;, a pro-inflammatory cytokine secreted by activated natural killer cells and T-cells, is known to interfere with TGF&#946; signalling in other contexts. Independently TGF&#946;, LPS and LTA stimulate GM-CSF production while differentially regulating IL-6 and KC production. Conversely IFN&#947; inhibits GM-CSF production, without effecting IL-6 or KC. Pair wise combinations of TGF&#946;, LPS and LTA resulted in additive stimulation of GM-CSF, while addition of IFN&#947; to cultures in conjunction with any of these molecules downregulated GM-CSF and KC stimulation. These in vitro studies indicate factor-specific interactions between seminal fluid constituents and highlight the complex nature of seminal fluid signalling. Consequently we propose that the relative ratio of seminal signalling factors is likely to be more important than the absolute concentration of various regulators, in determining the optimal female reproductive tract response. Using the mouse as an in vivo model, I have in addition demonstrated that LPS and LTA instilled into an estrous uterus can elicit cytokine production comparable to that observed following insemination. Further, these studies have shown that IFN&#947; instilled into the uterus of a recently mated mouse can reduce the post-copulatory GM-CSF and KC surge. However administration of IFN&#947; had no effect on near term pregnancy outcomes including fetal or placental weights, fetal crown-rump length, or implantation or resorption rates. The &#8216;developmental origins of adult disease hypothesis&#8217; proposes the idea that the early uterine environment encountered by the conceptus contributes toward the risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood, hence a long term study of progeny conceived after IFN&#947; administration was also undertaken. Neo-natal outcomes, such as birth weight, litter size and gestation length were unaltered, as was growth trajectory to 22 weeks of age. Adult metabolic markers, glucose tolerance, organ weight, muscle weight, adiposity and systolic blood pressure were not affected by the perturbation of peri-conceptual cytokine parameters. This work has examined the potential regulatory role of a number of seminal fluid signalling agents in directing the post-mating cytokine response, and has furthermore shown the relatively resilient nature of the early cytokine environment to subtle perturbation. Delineating the identity and roles of seminal fluid factors in early pregnancy brings us closer to an understanding of the key physiological events of early pregnancy and assists in identifying potential risk factors for human pregnancy pathologies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seminal fluid; semen, mating, insemination; pregnancy; progeny; inflammatory; cytokines; leukocytes; IFNgamma; microflora</field><field name="subject">Generative organs, Female.</field><field name="subject">Pregnancy</field><field name="subject">Semen</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59018</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of migration on development in Tuvalu : a case study of PAC migrants and their families : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Simati, Sunema Pie</field><field name="description">International migration and development have been traditionally treated as separate policy portfolios; however, today the two are increasingly viewed as interlinked. While the development status of a country could determine migration flows, migration can, in turn, contribute positively to national development, including economic, social and cultural progress. Consequently, if migration is not well managed, it can pose development challenges to a country&#8217;s development and progress. Therefore, partnership through greater networking between countries of origin and destination is needed to fully utilise the development potential of migration. For Tuvalu, migration has remained a vital ingredient for economic development and more importantly, the welfare of its people. The implementation of New Zealand&#8217;s Pacific Access Category (PAC) scheme in 2002 offered for the first time a formal migration opportunity for permanent or long-term migration of Tuvaluans. The PAC scheme allows 75 Tuvaluans per year to apply for permanent residence to work and live in New Zealand, provided they meet the scheme&#8217;s conditions. The goal of this research is to investigate, more than five years after PAC&#8217;s implementation, the ways in which long-term migration of Tuvaluans, through the PAC scheme, has benefited Tuvalu. To give a broader perspective on the issues explored in this study, the views of Tuvaluan leaders, as significant players in traditional Tuvaluan society, are included, in addition to the perspective of migrants&#8217; families in Tuvalu and the migrants themselves in New Zealand. Combining transnationalist and developmental approaches as a theoretical framework, this thesis explores how Tuvalu&#8217;s mobile and immobile populations, through articulation of transnationalism, enhance family welfare, and grassroots and national development. The eight weeks&#8217; fieldwork in Tuvalu and Auckland demonstrated that the physical separation of Tuvaluans from one another through migration does not limit the richness of the interactions and connections between them. In fact, the existence of active networking between island community groups and other Tuvaluan associations in Auckland and in Tuvalu strengthens the Tuvaluan culture both abroad and at home, thus ensuring strong family and community coherence. Maintaining transnational networks and practices is identified as of great significance to grassroots and community-based development in Tuvalu. However, the benefits of long-term migration can only be sustained as long as island loyalty, or loto fenua, and family kinship stays intact across borders, and networking amongst families, communities and church remains active.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Tuvalu</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital reporting formats and users of financial reports : decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the context of recognition versus disclosure : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Accountancy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ghani, Erlane K.</field><field name="description">The evolvement of digital reporting has changed the way financial information is prepared and disseminated (Debreceny and Gray, 200 1 ). Previous research has shown that digital reporting has increased, particularly in the last five years, and this usage is characterised by greater volumes of business and financial information over that traditionally provided in print-based mode (Smith, 2003). The new opportunities and benefits offered by digital reporting are matched by challenges and implications not only for the preparers and auditors but also for users. It is expected that in the near future, financial reporting will move entirely from the primarily print-based mode to digital-based mode as the primary information dissemination channel (Oyelere et aI., 2003; Fisher et aI., 2004). Research in the area of digital reporting has been conducted in the past decade. Within this research, a considerable number of issues have been raised. These issues relate to various parties, such as policy makers, preparers, auditors, system designers and users. While several research questions and hypotheses concerning these parties have been posed and investigated, most of the research questions and hypotheses have been formed from a preparers' perspective, leaving the examination of issues from a users' perspective largely unexplored. This study focuses on users. It examines the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance in relation to decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the digital reporting environment. It aims to extend the digital reporting literature. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on digital reporting environment in several ways. First, this study examines the effect of presentation formats on the quality of users' decision making. This study follows Kleinmuntz and Schkade (1993) who described 'decision quality' in the context of two cost-benefit dimensions in relation to decision makers' cognitive processes, namely decision accuracy and cognitive effort. Decision accuracy reflects the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate outcome while cognitive effort reflects the total cognitive expenditure incurred in completing a task. Second, this study examines users' perceptions of three digital presentation formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. This study compares subjects' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of the three presentation formats with their actual outcome. It also includes examining whether perceptions are an important factor in influencing preferred presentation format. Finally, this study examines whether digital presentation formats address the concern over functional fixation in the accounting context of 'recognition versus disclosure' in the reporting of financial information. This study used public accounting practitioners in New Zealand as participants. Sixty two subjects participated in the experiment, which involves an experiment exercise and a post experiment questionnaire. The results indicate that presentation formats impact on decision accuracy. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted using non-digital presentation formats such as tabular and graphical in the psychology and information systems literature (Stock and Watson, 1984; Dickson et aI., 1986; Iselin, 1988; DeSanctis and Jarvenpaa, 1989; Mackay and Villareal, 1987; Hard and Vanacek, 1991; Stone and Schkade, 1991; Anderson and Kaplan, 1992; Bricker and Nehmer, 1995; Ramarapu et aI., 1997; Frownfelter-Lohrke, 1998; Almer et aI., 2003). The results, however, indicate that presentation formats do not impact decision makers' cognitive effort. These findings suggest that preparers, standardsetters and regulatory bodies should recognise that presentation format impacts on users' decision making processes and select appropriate formats that lead to improvement in decision making. Additionally, the results indicate that users' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the reporting technologies are similar across the three presentation formats. The results also show that users' perceptions do not necessary correspond to actual performance. Users' perceptions are found to influence their preferred presentation format. The findings of this study provide useful insights on users' perceptions, performances and preferences of the digital presentation formats. Such results provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the importance of perceptions and the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance. This is particularly relevant since if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, then there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of presentation. Finally, the results show that of the four recognised stages of information processing (i.e. acquisition, evaluation, weighting and judging information), functional fixation is found to only exist at the judgment stage. However, the effect of presentation format is only significant at information evaluation stage. The results indicate that the interaction between presentation formats and placement of information does not affect decision makers' information processing. This suggests that presentation formats do not solve the concern about recognition versus disclosure (functional fixation) in information processing stages. These fmdings are not consistent with Hodge et al. (2004) but are consistent with Luft and Shields (2001) who suggest functional fixation could not be alleviated because the accounting itself would affect the allocation of people's attention. This study extends the literature on presentation format by examining the quality of decision making arising from the use of different presentation formats in a digital reporting environment. It provides evidence that users' perceptions of ease of use of a presentation format do not necessarily correspond to their actual performance (cognitive effort) once a particular task has been performed. This study also provides evidence that the acceptance of a technology is highly dependent on the perceptions of that technology. Therefore, limited knowledge and appreciation of the capabilities of a technology may have the undesired effect of deterring use of the technology although it may improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late quaternary lahars from Mount Ruapehu in the Whangaehu River, North Island, New Zealand : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosoophy in Soil Science at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Hodgson, Katherine Anne</field><field name="description">The stratigraphic record of lahars in the Whangaehu River reveals that in the past 180,000 years this route has been one of the main conduits for lahars from Mount Ruapehu, the highest active andesitic stratovolcano in the Central North Island of New Zealand. Both debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows have engulfed surfaces up to 160 km distance from the Volcano. Eight episodes of laharic activity are recognized by the distinctive lithology and similar age of their deposits. The newly defined upper Pleistocene Whangaehu Formation provides evidence for the earliest lahar event in the Valley, c. 180,000- 140,000 years ago. There is only meagre evidence for laharic activity following this event until the Ohakean and Holocene, although two new informally named deposits - the Mangatipona pumice sand (c. 37,000 years B.P.) and Apitian lahars (c. 32,000-25,500 years B.P) - are recognized, of minor extent. The formerly defined late Quaternary Te Heuheu (c. 25,500- 14,700 years B.P.), Tangatu (c. 14,700-5,370 years B.P.), Manutahi (c. 5 ,370-3,4600 years B.P.), Mangaio (c. 4,600 years B.P.) and Onetapu (&lt; c. 1,850 years B.P.) Formations are here described and interpreted. Triggering mechanisms for lahar deposits are distinguished based on lithological criteria. (a) Bouldery deposits in the Whangaehu Formation are interpreted to have been emplaced by a single highly competent debris flow triggered by a southerly-directed flank collapse at Mount Ruapehu. This debris flow was competent enough to transport boulders up to 2 m in diameter over 140 km from the Volcano. Bouldery deposits are also recognized in the Onetapu Formation, but are restricted to higher gradient surfaces on the Mount Ruapehu ring plain. The Onetapu Formation deposits are interpreted to have been emplaced by lahars resulting from catastrophic drainage of Crater Lake, which occupies the active crater on Mount Ruapehu. (b) Pebbly and sandy deposits are interpreted to have been emplaced by low competence debris flows and hyperconcentrated flows. These lahar deposits are recognized in all formations described. The lithology in these deposits is commonly pumice and they are interpreted to have been triggered by eruptions and/or high rainfall events at the Volcano. Formations, and individual members within Formations, were dated by radiocarbon dating of organic material found below, within or above lahar deposits, or by coverbed stratigraphy. Both rhyolitic and andesitic tephras provided recognizable time planes in the late Quaternary coverbeds overlying lahar deposits. In this study quantitative analysis of quartz abundance, which is shown to vary between loesses and palaeosols, is used as an indirect means of establishing a surrogate for past climate changes which have been correlated to the deep sea oxygen isotope curve. A minimum age for the newly defined Whangaehu Formation is established by this method. The accumulation rate for lahars in the Whangaehu River has accelerated from 1 km3 every c. 23,000 years in the past c. 160,000 years to 1 km3 in 589 years in the past c. 2,000 years. This acceleration probably results from the increased frequency of lahars in the River following the development of Crater Lake c. 2,000 years B.P. According to this pattern an estimated 0.17 km3 volume of lahars could be anticipated over the next 100 years. If the 2,000 year accumulation rate were to be met over the next 100 years there would be 170 lahars of l0[superscript]6 m3 in this time interval , or 17 lahars of 10[superscript]7 m3 (or 1.7 lahars of 10[superscript]8 m3). The largest reported volume for an historic lahar is 10[superscript]6 m3 and these have occurred on average once every 30 years. The accumulation rate for historic lahars is 0.0054 km3 in 100 years. Therefore, although the accumulation rate appears to have slowed down, further large lahars with magnitudes 10 or 100 times greater than those witnessed could be expected.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Laharic activity</field><field name="subject">Debris flows</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260103 Vulcanology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing the shopping centre as a consumption site : creating appealing environments for visitors : some Australian and New Zealand examples : a thesis in presented [sic] in partial fulfilment for the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Geography at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Bowler, Susan Mary</field><field name="description">The position occupied by retailing within the production - consumption debate is the subject of dispute. As neither sphere can be fully analysed in isolation such argument may be somewhat irrelevant. The need to conceptualise the two spheres together, therefore, has informed this research on the created environments of shopping centres. Planned and managed shopping centres are a ubiquitous part of the built environment in 'advanced capitalist' nations. There has been a tendency, however, for researchers to focus upon exceptional centres rather than everyday examples of this particular consumption site. They have concentrated upon how shopping centre environments appear to be created and the appeal researchers assume they may have for an observer. My research for this thesis, however, has been concerned with how managers create shopping centre environments and how they are designed so as to appeal to their centres' perceived markets. This was done by conducting semi - structured interviews with a number of centre managers in Australia and New Zealand . The unified ownership and management structure of shopping centres makes it easier for their created environ ments to be controlled. Shopping centre researchers and those who have attempted to read the built environment as if it were a text have tended to assume that the architectural styles used will reflect dominant ideologies and that they are powerless to interpret or alter them in any other than the manner intended by the designers, developers and owners. Many of the managers recognised, however, that shoppers cannot be forced to visit nor can they be made to purchase. Research was therefore commissioned by management as a way of gaining socio - economic information on the individuals in their catchments , their 'needs' and desires. Selecting tenants which would appeal to their markets and arranging them in a manner which reflected the way people liked to shop was thought to be paramount to the success or otherwise of a centre. Some managers, for example, claimed that there was a difference between 'doing' the shopping (which is a chore) and 'going' shopping (which is enjoyable ) and that this needed to be kept in mind when they positioned retailers within their centres. Consumption does not only involve the purchase of commodities for their use and/or sign value but is also concerned with experience. Managers attempted to provide their shoppers with an enjoyable experience when they visited their centres by, for example, the creation of an appealing ambience and by either suggesting or insisting, respectively, that the common areas and leased spaces be regularly refurbished.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shopping environments</field><field name="subject">Shopping centre management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface characteristics of an adhesive thermophilic spore-forming Bacillus, isolated from milk powder : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jon Stuart</field><field name="description">The growth of thermophiles during the manufacture of milk powder leads to a progressive increase in the number of thermophilic bacteria contaminating the final product. The limited residence time of the milk in the plant during milk powder manufacture and the concentration effect of converting milk into milk powder cannot explain the number of thermophiles found in the final product. This suggests that thermophiles are attaching to the large surface area of stainless steel found within a milk powder plant and then growing and developing into biofilms, with individual cells and/or biofilm fragments sloughing off into the product line and thus contaminating the final product. The aim of the present study was to investigate the attachment mechanisms that enable the thermophile Anoxybacillus flavithermus (B 1 2) to attach to stainless steel surfaces. Passing a B 1 2 culture through a column of stainless steel chips, collecting the first cells to pass through, re-culturing and repeating the process six times, resulted in the isolation of a mutant, labelled X7, with lO-fold reduced ability to attach to stainless steel as well as a reduced ability to attach to plastic and glass. A comparison of bacterial cell surface properties indicated that X7 was less hydrophobic than its parental strain B 1 2 . Cell surface charge measurements also suggest that X7 has less net negative surface charge. Disruption of extracellular polysaccharides and DNA appeared to have no effect on the attachment process. Removal of surface proteins caused a reduction in attachment of B 1 2 and X7 as well as a reduction in surface hydrophobicity suggesting surface protein involvement in both. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of lysozyme/mutanolysin extracted surface proteins revealed two proteins expressed at reduced levels in X 7 compared with B 1 2 . One protein was identified by mass spectrometry as the cytoplasmic enzyme Formate acetyltransferase. The role of Formate acetyltransferase and the second unidentified protein on the attachment process of Anoxybacillus flavithermus remains unclear.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">milk powder manufacture</field><field name="subject">biofilms</field><field name="subject">Anoxybacillus flavithermus</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of complex programmed patterns of anthocyanin pigment formation in Antirrhinum majus : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philsophy in Plant Molecular Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pathirana, Nilangani Nadyeshda</field><field name="description">Antirrhinum majus is a model plant used in flower pigmentation studies. Anthocyanin pigment production is mainly controlled by regulation of transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. Two types of transcription factors, M Y B and bHLH, together with a WD40 type co-regulator have been shown to regulate the transcription of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. In antirrhinum, in addition to the wild type Rosea 1 phenotype, in which pigmentation occurs throughout the inner and outer epidermis of the petal , other complex pigmentation patterns are observed, such as anthocyanins being produced only in the outer (abaxial) epidermis of both lobes and upper tube region of the dorsal petals (roseadorsea phenotype). The major objective of this research project was to understand the genetic regulatory system leading to the development of the two different floral pigmentation patterns in antirrhinum as a means to understanding differential regulation of gene expression in similar cells. Promoter deletion analysis coupled with linker scanning mutagenesis identified the - 1 62 bp to - 1 20 bp region of the Rosea l promoter as i mportant for the regulation of the Rosea l gene. Four putative transcription factor-binding sites within this region : a Wbox, a pyrimidine box, a DOF and a WRKY transcription factor binding site were shown to be important for Rosea l gene regulation. Promoter deletion analysis carried out on the rosea ldorsea promoter showed that the proximal 1 87 bp deletion was, surprisingly, not responsible for the roseadorsea phenotype. Cloning and characterisation of the Rosea l promoter sequence from various Antirrhinum species and accessions verified this finding. The rosealdorsea promoter analysis also indicated that - 1 5 1 bp of the promoter was sufficient for its expression as well as for the maintenance of petal specific expression. The rosea ldorsea allele was also shown to encode a functional protein . In situ hybridisation analysis showed that Rosea l transcripts were present in the inner and outer epidermis of the petal tissue of both wild type and roseadorsea petal tissue. Vascular expression of the Roseal mRNA is indicative of regulation of this gene through sugar or hormonal cues. However, rosea ldorsea transcript levels (in roseadorsea) were much lower than Roseal (wild type). Lowered expression of rosea ldorsea transcripts may be responsible for the overall weak pigmentation in the roseadorsea flowers. Analysis of the intron sequences of the two alleles revealed that many sequence changes were present in the intron 2 of rosea l dorsea. These changes may lead to instability or the lower expression of the rosea l dorsea mRNA and may be responsible for the roseadorsea phenotype. Another possibility is that a fourth Myb gene may be responsible for the roseadorsea phenotype. The role of the Deficiens gene in direct regulation of Rosea l was analysed by RNAi and bioinformatics-based methods. The presence of potential MADS box binding sites in the intron 2 region of the Roseal allele indicated that Rosea l might be directly regulated by Deficiens. Initial experiments using transient assays did not support this suggestion. However, silencing of Deficiens in wild type antirrhinum buds led to the loss of anthocyanin pigments in the petals. Further analysis of the RNAi tissue using SEM revealed that the proper development of conical shaped epidermal cells was also affected . The RNAi tissue also developed chlorophyll pigments underscoring the plasticity of petal identity. This work demonstrated that proper expression of Deficiens is required throughout flowering for anthocyanin pigment production as well as maintenance of petal cell identity. The current investigation revealed that the higher order regulation of the Rosea l alleles in antirrhinum petals is much more complex than initially postulated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Snapdragon</field><field name="subject">Flower pigmentation</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270402 Plant physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Initialisation and Decentralised Control for Robotic Control</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Anh Duy</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Gaining access to land is the primary strategy for those who are &#8216;landless&#8217; in an attempt to reposition themselves within society.  The problem, however, is that social exclusion continues even after access to land has been gained, and that land reform strategies are not sufficient on their own to redress uneven social relations and power.  Put in other words, the ways that land reform policies are currently constructed limit the opportunities, and may exacerbate the difficulties, experienced by those who gain access to land through &#8216;landless peasant&#8217; activism.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power, purpose and politics: a history of the Jervis Bay nuclear project</field><field name="creator">Hills, Stephen Charles Robert</field><field name="description">Using the Jervis Bay nuclear power project as its centrepiece, this thesis examines the Australian Government&#8217;s attitudes and policies towards electric power generation using nuclear technology from the earliest beginnings as the technology was developed during the 1940s to the cancellation of the Jervis Bay project in 1971.

F. (Kaikawaka)</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Limin</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates some of the potential of Libocedrus bidwillii Hook. f. (Kaikawaka) for dendroclimatological research by developing tree-ring chronologies and then using these chronologies to reconstruct palaeoclimates.  In order to assist with the modelling of tree-growth and climate relationships (response function analysis), the annual nature of Libocedrus bidwillii growth was investigated. Results showed that seedlings of Libocedrus bidwillii were sensitive to temperature and soil moisture. Greatest growth was at high soil moisture and under a variable temperature regime. It was also found that there was an obvious seasonal variation in the growth of the seedlings. Such information allowed some confidence in the use of the species as a proxy-climatic indicator.  Twenty-three tree-ring chronologies were developed from different areas of New Zealand. These included 12 new sites, 5 sites collected by other people but then updated and 6 sites that were not updated.  Standardisation of the tree-ring series from each site used double detrending methods - ERH+SP67% (linear-Exponential or linear Regression or a Horizontal detrending plus SPline detrending fitted to 2/3 the length of the tree-ring series). This meant some long-term trends in the data were retained (i. e. greater than 120 year cycles) although this led to some reduction of the strength of the common signal in the chronology as measured by EPS (Expressed Population Signal) and SNR (Signal of Noise Ratio). The retention of long-term trends in the chronologies was thought to be important because some low frequency signals, which are longer than 120 years, are present in the climate data.  Autocorrelation in the chronologies was removed by the ARSTAN program using the Aikaike Information Criterion (AIC) to determine the filter model. No significant autocorrelations were left in the residual chronologies produced by this method.  Inter-comparison of the chronologies showed a highly consistent and significant pattern between most of the sites. There was little reduction in inter-chronology correlation with separation distance. However, there was a difference, or an effect, due to altitude.  In general the response functions for the relationship between climate variables and ring-width in any given growing season showed a negative relationship between temperature for the prior growth months February, March and current December, while there was a positive response to temperature in September and February. There were three significant negative coefficients (previous March, April and August) and one positive (current February) for precipitation.  The results of using principal component analysis (PCA) showed that all the 27 significant response function analyses could be divided into four groups. The response pattern in the four groups was similar for temperature but the rainfall response was more variable.  The climate reconstructions were based on two groups of chronologies: eleven chronologies from all over New Zealand and a subset of only the three longest chronologies. Comparison of the climate data of different seasons with the two groups of chronologies was carried out using the "bootstrap" transfer function. The average February-March temperature and total March-April precipitation were finally selected as the reconstructed variables.  Both of the groups reconstructed the hot years better than the cold years. The reconstructed temperature series were similar to all the earlier New Zealand dendroclimatic reconstructions. The warming and cooling periods, extremely warm and extremely cold years were identified and compared with some other sources of evidence and found to be highly consistent. This led to the conclusion that Libocedrus bidwillii is very useful as a high resolution palaeotemperature indicator. In the precipitation reconstruction, all the periodicities (both high and low) in the observed data were reconstructed. The dry and wet periods, severe drought and very wet years were identified in both precipitation reconstructions and also compared with other more limited sources of evidence.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Libocedrus bidwillii</field><field name="subject">dendroclimatology</field><field name="subject">palaeoclimatology</field><field name="subject">dendrochronology</field><field name="subject">tree-rings</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">climate reconstruction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260600 Atmospheric Sciences::260602 Climatology (incl. palaeoclimatology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A complex systems perspective on communities and tourism : a comparison of two case studies in Kaikoura and Rotorua</field><field name="creator">Horn, Chrys</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses research into the evolution and adaptation of the communities in Rotorua and Kaikoura by using a complex systems perspective. This perspective requires that the analyst look beyond the obvious impacts of tourism such as employment, crowding, and congestion, to the processes that underlie the experiences of local people in relation to tourism.  The configuration of the destination, the flows of people in the area, the visitor types and the ratio of hosts to guests all influence a community's interactions with tourists. In small destinations, the effect of host interactions with guests is potentially much greater than is the case in larger destinations.  However, in using a complex systems perspective to analyse the effects of tourism on these two destinations, it becomes clear that the impacts of tourism are more than just the impacts of tourists. The impacts of tourism are intertwined with the processes of trust, leadership and decision making occurring both within the community and within the wider regional and national socio-economic systems. As such, local perceptions of tourism are associated with history, geography, local politics and local social processes.  As concepts, the meanings of both 'tourism' and 'community' emerge from the experiences people have, and the associations that they make with the two terms. Thus, the meaning of both 'tourism' and 'community' are idiosyncratic and locally defined. Each term means different things to residents in Rotorua and Kaikoura, and each affects how residents perceive tourism in their respective towns. For example, the associations that people make between historical events and processes such as restructuring are quite different in each of the two communities. In Rotorua, tourism is seen as a source of stability, as a phenomenon that confers a higher level of perceived control on the community. In Kaikoura, tourism is seen as a source of change and it confers a lesser sense of perceived control on the community overall.  Likewise, the relationship between the local council and the community underlies the sense of security people feel about local decision making processes. This relationship is mediated by a range of processes including the effort that the council put into communicating with community members, the leadership shown by the council, the way in which they facilitate community visioning processes, which then provide a basis for both leadership and decision making. Underlying these processes are community processes of rivalry, competition, cooperation, labelling and stereotyping that all affect the levels of trust that the community have in those around them. Community cohesion (which is not the same as community agreement) underlies a community's ability to work together to manage tourism.  Thus using a complex systems approach to analyse the impacts of tourism in two destinations has shown that there is much more to tourism than the impacts of tourists and their activities. Instead, the way the community system interacts with the tourism system gives rise to the impacts of tourism. Tourism can be usefully conceptualised as a process that is inextricably interwoven with history, politics and community interaction processes at the destination level. Perceptions of tourism reflect these processes and the understanding that local people have of them, and the level of control that they feel they have over tourism development.  With little trust in local decision making processes, people have a low sense of control over how tourism development affects them. In tourism planning, therefore, it may be more effective to focus primarily on the processes by which tourism development and management occurs in the local area and to look at mitigating the effects of tourists only after building community capacity to adaptively manage tourism in their area. Communities need a sense of control over their world, and this is only undermined when experts and institutions try to advise courses of action without involving a range of community players in the process of managing tourism. Thus, government and other organisations and institutions at local level must focus on working with communities to build local capacity to manage tourism, without imposing on those communities to convince them to 'treat tourists well' or to manage their environment better, so they become more attractive as a destination.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">qualitative methods</field><field name="subject">complexity theory</field><field name="subject">chaos theory</field><field name="subject">systems</field><field name="subject">tourism</field><field name="subject">community</field><field name="subject">perceptions</field><field name="subject">social impacts</field><field name="subject">community development</field><field name="subject">reflexivity</field><field name="subject">perceptions of control</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">Rotorua</field><field name="subject">Kaikoura</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350500 Tourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'construction' of landscape : a case study of the Otago Peninsula, Aotearoa / New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Read, Marion</field><field name="description">This project has sought to answer the question 'How is landscape made?&#8217; by examining the landscape of the Otago Peninsula on the east coast of the South Island of Aotearoa/New Zealand. By taking a social constructionist approach, an in depth case study has been completed using ethnographic methods combined with discourse analysis.  The theoretical framework adopted led to the research question being refined and divided into two parts. The first seeks to determine the discourses that construct the landscape of the Otago Peninsula. Those identified include discourses of Mana Whenua, agriculture, environmentalism, gardening, heritage, neo-liberalism and the picturesque. These discourses interact and resist one another through networks of power. Thus the second part of the research question seeks to understand these networks and the distributions of power through them. The agricultural discourse is the most powerful, albeit under strong challenge from the environmental discourse and from the impacts of neo-liberalism. Mana Whenua discourses have gained significant power in recent decades, but their influence is tenuous. The picturesque discourse has significant power and has been utilised as a key tool in District planning in the area.  Thus, the landscape is seen to be made by the dynamic interactions of discourses. This has two consequences, the first, an emphasising of the dynamism of the landscape - it is a process which is under constant flux as a consequence of both the human interactions with and within it, and the biophysical processes which continue outside of human ken. The second consequence is to stress that the landscape is not a unitary object and that this needs to be recognised in the formulation of policy and landscape management.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">landscape</field><field name="subject">Aotearoa / New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Otago Peninsula</field><field name="subject">discourse</field><field name="subject">discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">power</field><field name="subject">Landscape Architecture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology::370109 Environmental Sociology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building::310100 Architecture and Urban Environment::310104 Landscape planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Testing the effect of in planta RNA silencing on Plasmodiophora brassicae infection</field><field name="creator">Bulman, S. R.</field><field name="description">In the late 1990s, a series of landmark publications described RNA interference (RNAi) and related RNA silencing phenomena in nematodes, plants and fungi. By manipulating RNA silencing, biologists have been able to create tools for specifically inactivating genes. In organisms from trypanosomes to insects, RNA silencing is now indispensible for studying gene function. RNA silencing has been used in a project aimed at systematically knocking out all genes in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.  RNA silencing has a natural role in defending eukaryotic cells against virus replication. By assembling virus DNA sequences in a form that triggers RNA silencing, biologists have created plants resistant to specific viruses. In this study, we set out to test if a similar approach would protect plants against infection by the agriculturally important Brassica pathogen, Plasmodiophora brassicae. P. brassicae is an obligate intracellular biotroph, from the little studied eukaryotic supergroup, the Rhizaria.  To identify the gene sequences that would be starting material for P. brassicae RNA silencing, new P. brassicae genes were gathered by cDNA cloning or genomic PCR-walking. Using suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) and oligo-capping cloning of full-length cDNAs, 76 new gene sequences were identified. A large proportion of the cDNAs were predicted to contain signal peptides for ER translocation.  In addition to the new cDNA identified here, partial sequences for the P. brassicae actin and TPS genes were published by other researchers close to the beginning of this study. Using PCR-walking, full-length genomic DNA sequences from both genes were obtained. Later, genomic DNA sequences spanning or flanking a total of 24 P. brassicae genes were obtained. The P. brassicae genes were rich in typical eukaryotic spliceosomal introns. Transcription of P. brassicae genes also appears likely to begin from initiator elements rather than TATA-box-containing promoters.  A segment of the P. brassicae actin gene was assembled in hairpin format and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. Observation of simultaneous knockdown of the GUS marker gene as well as detection of siRNAs indicated that the hpRNA sequences induced RNA silencing. However, inoculation of these plants with P. brassicae resulted in heavy club root infection. We were unable to detect decreases in actin gene expression in the infecting P. brassicae, at either early or late stages of infection. We conclude that, within the limits of the techniques used here, there is no evidence for induction of RNA silencing in P. brassicae by in planta produced siRNAs.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plasmodiophora brassicae</field><field name="subject">club root</field><field name="subject">Rhizaria</field><field name="subject">RNA interference</field><field name="subject">in planta RNA silencing</field><field name="subject">Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="subject">suppression subtractive hybridisation</field><field name="subject">cDNA cloning</field><field name="subject">genome</field><field name="subject">intron</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fate of carbon and nitrogen from an organic effluent irrigated onto soil : process studies, model development and testing</field><field name="creator">Barkle, Gregory Francis</field><field name="description">The fate of the carbon and nitrogen in dairy farm effluent (DFE) applied onto soil was investigated through laboratory experiments and field lysimeter studies. They resulted in the development and testing of a complex carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) simulation model (CaNS-Eff) of the soil-plant-microbial system.  To minimise the risk of contamination of surface waters, regulatory authorities in New Zealand promote irrigation onto land as the preferred treatment method for DFE. The allowable annual loading rates for DFE, as defined in statutory regional plans are based on annual N balance calculations, comparing N inputs to outputs from the farming system. Little information is available, however, to assess the effects that these loading rates have on the receiving environment. It is this need, to understand the fate of land-applied DFE and develop a tool to describe the process, that is addressed in this research.  The microbially mediated net N mineralisation from DFE takes a central role in the turnover of DFE, as the total N in DFE is dominated by organic N. In a laboratory experiment, where DFE was applied at the standard farm loading rate of 68 kg N ha&#8315;&#185;, the net C mineralisation from the DFE was finished 13 days after application and represented 30% of the applied C, with no net N mineralisation being measured by Day 113. The soluble fraction of DFE appeared to have a microbial availability similar to that of glucose. The low and gradually changing respiration rate measured from DFE indicated a semi-continuous substrate supply to the microbial biomass, reflecting the complex nature and broad range of C compounds in DFE. The repeated application of DFE will gradually enhance the mineralisable fraction of the total soil organic N and in the long term increase net N mineralisation.  To address the lack of data on the fate of faecal-N in DFE, a &#185;&#8309;N-labelled faecal component of DFE was applied under two different water treatments onto intact soil cores with pasture growing on them. At the end of 255 days, approximately 2% of the applied faecal &#185;&#8309;N had been leached, 11 % was in plant material, 11 % was still as effluent on the surface, and 40% remained in the soil (39% as organic N). Unmeasured gaseous losses and physical losses from the soil surface of the cores supposedly account for the remaining &#185;&#8309;N (approximately 36%). Separate analysis of the total and ammonium nitrogen contents and &#185;&#8309;N enrichments of the DFE and filtered sub-samples (0.5 mm, 0.2&#181;m) showed that the faecal-N fraction was not labelled homogeneously. Due to this heterogeneity, which was exacerbated by the filtration of DFE on the soil surface, it was difficult to calculate the turnover of the total faecal-N fraction based on &#185;&#8309;N results.  By making a simplifying assumption about the enrichment of the &#185;&#8309;N in the DFE that infiltrated the soil, the contribution from DFE-N to all plant available N fractions including soil inorganic N was estimated to have been approximately 11 % of the applied DFE-N.  An initial two-year study investigating the feasibility of manipulating soil water conditions through controlled drainage to enhance denitrification from irrigated DFE was extended a further two years for this thesis project. The resulting four-year data set provided the opportunity to evaluate the sustainability of DFE application onto land, an extended data set against which to test the adequacy of CaNS-Eff, and to identify the key processes in the fate of DFE irrigated onto soil under field conditions.  In the final year of DFE irrigation, 1554 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; of DFE-N was applied onto the lysimeters, with the main removal mechanism being pasture uptake (700 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185;  removed). An average of 193 kg N ha&#8315;&#185; yr&#8315;&#185; was leached, with 80% of this being organic N. The nitrate leaching decreased with increasing soil moisture conditions through controlled drainage. At the high DFE loading rate used, the total soil C and N, pH and the microbial biomass increased at different rates over the four years. The long-term sustainability of the application of DFE can only be maintained when the supply of inorganic N is matched by the demand of the pasture.  The complex simulation model (CaNS-Eff) of the soil-plant-microbial system was developed to describe the transport and transformations of C and N components in effluents applied onto the soil. The model addresses the shortcomings in existing models and simulates the transport, adsorption and filtration of both dissolved and particulate components of an effluent. The soil matrix is divided into mobile and immobile flow domains with convective flow of solutes occurring in the mobile fraction only. Diffusion is considered to occur between the micropore and mesopore domains both between and within a soil layer, allowing dissolved material to move into the immobile zone.  To select an appropriate sub-model to simulate the water fluxes within CaNS-Eff, the measured drainage volumes and water table heights from the lysimeters were compared to simulated values over four years. Two different modelling approaches were compared, a simpler water balance model, DRAINMOD, and a solution to Richards' equation, SWIM. Both models provided excellent estimation of the total amount of drainage and water table height. The greatest errors in drainage volume were associated with rain events over the summer and autumn, when antecedent soil conditions were driest. When soil water and interlayer fluxes are required at small time steps such as during infiltration under DFE-irrigation, SWIM's more mechanistic approach offered more flexibility and consequently was the sub-model selected to use within CaNS-Eff.  Measured bromide leaching from the lysimeters showed that on average 18% of the bromide from an irrigation event bypassed the soil matrix and was leached in the initial drainage event. This bypass mechanism accounted for the high amount of organic N leached under DFE-irrigation onto these soils and a description of this bypass process needed to be included in CaNS-Eff. Between 80 and 90% of the N and C leached from the lysimeters was particulate (&gt; 0.2 &#181;m in size), demonstrating the need to describe transport of particulate material in CaNS-Eff. The filtration behaviour of four soil horizons was measured by characterising the size of C material in a DFE, applying this DFE onto intact soil cores, and collecting and analyzing the resulting leachate using the same size characterisation. After two water flushes, an average of 34% of the applied DFE-C was leached through the top 0-50 mm soil cores, with a corresponding amount of 27% being leached from the 50-150 mm soil cores. Most of the C leaching occurred during the initial DFE application onto the soil. To simulate the transport and leaching of particulate C, a sub-model was developed and parameterised that describes the movement of the effluent in terms of filtering and trapping the C within a soil horizon and then washing it out with subsequent flow events.  The microbial availability of the various organic fractions within the soil system are described in CaNS-Eff by availability spectra of multiple first-order decay functions. The simulation of microbial dynamics is based on actual consumption of available C for three microbial biomass populations: heterotrophs, nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The respiration level of a population is controlled by the amount of C that is available to that population. This respiration rate can vary between low level maintenance requirements, when very little substrate is available, and higher levels when excess substrate is available to an actively growing population. The plant component is described as both above and below-ground fractions of a rye grass-clover pasture.  The parameter set used in CaNS-Eff to simulate the fate of DFE irrigated onto the conventionally drained lysimeter treatments over three years with a subsequent 10 months non-irrigation period was derived from own laboratory studies, field measurements, experimental literature data and published model studies. As no systematic calibration exercise was undertaken to optimise these parameters, the parameter set should be considered as "initial best estimates" and not as a calibrated data set on which a full validation of CaNS-Eff could be based.  Over the 42 months of simulation, the cumulative drainage from CaNS-Eff for the conventionally drained DFE lysimeter was always within the 95% CI of the measured value. On the basis of individual drainage bulking periods, CaNS-Eff was able to explain 92% of the variation in the measured drainage volumes. On an event basis the accuracy of the simulated water filled pore space (WFPS) was better than that of the drainage volume, with an average of 70% of the simulated WFPS values being within the 95% CI for the soil layers investigated, compared to 44% for the drainage volumes. Overall the hydrological component of CaNS-Eff, which is based on the SWIM model, could be considered as satisfactory for the purposes of predicting the soil water status and drainage volume from the conventionally drained lysimeter treatment for this study.  The simulated cumulative nitrate leaching of 4.7 g NO&#8323;-N m&#8315;&#178; over the 42 months of lysimeter operation was in good agreement to the measured amount of 3.0 (&#177; 2.7) g NO&#8323;-N m&#8315;&#178;. Similarly, the total simulated ammonium leaching of 2.7g  NH&#8324;- N m&#8315;&#178; was very close to the measured amount of 2.5 (&#177; 1.35) g NH&#8324;- N m&#8315;&#178; , however the dynamics were not as close to the measured values as with the nitrate leaching. The simulated amount of organic N leached was approximately double that measured, and most of the difference originated from the simulated de-adsorption of the dissolved fraction of organic N during the l0-month period after the final DFE irrigation. The 305 g C m&#8315;&#178; of simulated particulate C leached was close to the measured amount of 224 g C m&#8315;&#178; over the 31 months of simulation. The dissolved C fraction was substantially over-predicted. There was good agreement in the non-adsorbed and particulate fractions of the leached C and N in DFE. However, the isothermic behaviour of the adsorbed pools indicated that a non-reversible component needed to be introduced or that the dynamics of the de-adsorption needed to be improved. Taking into account that the parameters were not calibrated but only "initial best estimates", the agreement in the dynamics and the absolute amounts between the measured and simulated values of leached C and N demonstrated that CaNS-Eff contains an adequate description of the leaching processes following DFE irrigation onto the soil.  The simulated pasture N production was in reasonable agreement with the measured data. The simulated dynamics and amounts of microbial biomass in the topsoil layers were in good agreement with the measured data. This is an important result as the soil microbial biomass is the key transformation station for organic materials. Excepting the topsoil layer, the simulated total C and N dynamics were close to the measured values. The model predicted an accumulation of C and N in the topsoil layer as expected, but not measured. Although no measurements were available to compare the dynamics and amounts of the soil NO&#8323;-N and NH&#8324;-N, the simulated values appear realistic for an effluent treatment site and are consistent with measured pasture data. Considering the large amount of total N and C applied onto the lysimeters over the 42 months of operation (4 t ha&#8315;&#185; of N and 42 t ha&#8315;&#185;0f C), the various forms of C and N in dissolved and particulate DFE as well as in returned pasture, and that the parameters used in the test have not been calibrated, the simulated values from CaNS-Eff compared satisfactorily to the measured data.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon</field><field name="subject">nitrogen</field><field name="subject">organic effluent</field><field name="subject">nitrate leaching</field><field name="subject">dairy farm effluent (DFE)</field><field name="subject">soil-plant-microbial system</field><field name="subject">mineralisation</field><field name="subject">immobilisation</field><field name="subject">microbial biomass</field><field name="subject">faecal 15N</field><field name="subject">controlled drainage</field><field name="subject">lysimeters</field><field name="subject">bypass flow</field><field name="subject">simulation model</field><field name="subject">multiple availability spectrum</field><field name="subject">dissolved and particulate organic matter</field><field name="subject">filtration</field><field name="subject">mobile and immobile flow domains</field><field name="subject">diffusion</field><field name="subject">non-equilibrium adsorption-desorption kinetics</field><field name="subject">050205 - Environmental Management</field><field name="subject">050304 - Soil Chemistry (excl.

The study examined the interrelationship between 'global' and 'local' or 'contingent' factors and their impact upon leisure behaviour, leisure policy and leisure structures. 'Local' factors included institutional arrangements (notably political ones) and national cultural practices. A social history of New Zealand and Malaysia with particular reference to leisure, sport and recreation and national cultural practices was provided as a context for discussion of these issues.  The study utilised a mixture of archival and library research and semi-structured interview, and was guided by an explicit comparative framework, concentrating on the development of leisure, sport and recreation in the two countries between 1970 and 2002. Interviews with 'key players' in both countries captured valuable data in the form of 'insiders' views' on leisure behaviour, policy and structure. These data were analysed with the relevance of the convergence thesis in mind. This study shows that contemporary leisure behaviour in New Zealand and Malaysia is shaped by the media and is highly commercialised, placing a high value on entertainment, and involves increasingly passive forms of participation. Informal sport and individualised recreational activities are replacing organised team-based sports in popularity. Leisure behaviour trends have led governments in both countries to encourage greater participation in sport and physical activity and to encourage private sector ventures into leisure-related products, services and infra-structures in the form of private-public partnerships.  In terms of leisure policy, developments in leisure, recreation and, noticeably, sport, in Malaysia and New Zealand have been shaped by the wider agendas of the governing political parties. This is particularly noticeable at central government level. Individual political leaders in both countries have been influential in setting leisure-related policy. They had the vision to see that sport in particular might serve wider, national interests and that investments in sport could help raise the profiles of their countries in international markets and among trading organisations and the regulatory bodies that oversee trading practices.  Malaysian and New Zealand governments seek to make leisure, sport and recreation policy supportive of other priorities. In Malaysia, the government legitimises its control over the policies which affect people's lives by appeals to Islamic principles and the need to put collective needs of nation building ahead of individual concerns for freedom. In terms of institutional, political, arrangements, this impacts at both central and local government levels in Malaysia. New Zealand, following a pluralist, Westminster, tradition of political representation, experiences regular changes in political management at central government level and a system of local government whereby local autonomy is jealously protected. Malaysia has resisted 'the global', by virtue of the nation-building policies of the Barisan Nasional, which has been in power since 1957. New Zealand's 'resistance' stems in part at least from the autonomy which local government enjoys. These experiences demonstrate that resistance to 'global' change can take varied forms at the 'local', contingent, level (Thorns, 1992). Differences in leisure structures reflect, once again, different agendas stemming from different political arrangements. The Malaysian government's approach is multi-Ministry, and micro-managed. In New Zealand, a 'hands off' approach via a quasi-autonomous non-government organisation (&#8216;Quango'), became the favoured means of structuring central government leisure provision in the 1980s and 1990s. This was with a view to encouraging stability and consistency in leisure policy and provision in a pluralistic political system.  Overall, and 'cautiously', this study provided support for the convergence thesis as a way to explain development in leisure, recreation and sport in New Zealand and Malaysia over the past 32 years. Although institutional arrangements and national cultural practices have provided some resistance to convergence processes, changing consumer sentiments may weaken such resistance in future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">convergence</field><field name="subject">convergence thesis</field><field name="subject">leisure policy</field><field name="subject">Malaysian leisure policy</field><field name="subject">New Zealand leisure policy</field><field name="subject">comparative analysis</field><field name="subject">contingency</field><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">leisure consumption</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">Elite Sport</field><field name="subject">Sport-for-All</field><field name="subject">leisure behaviour</field><field name="subject">leisure structures</field><field name="subject">sport and recreation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect on protein synthesis in barley of infection with P. hordei</field><field name="creator">Morton, J. D.</field><field name="description">Infection of barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaves with the rust fungus, Puccinia hordei, causes changes in the host protein synthesis. This thesis analyses these changes in the barley cultivar Triumph following inoculation of 7-day-old leaves with either a virulent or an avirulent race of P. hordei.  The initial approach was to isolate membrane-bound polysomes from infected leaves, translate them in vitro and analyse the translation products. These products include the integral membrane proteins which were expected to be involved in the response of the host to the pathogen. A method based on differential centrifugation in the presence of a ribonuclease-inhibiting buffer was developed for separating membrane-bound polysomes from the rest of the cytoplasmic polysomes. Membrane-bound polysomes were found to comprise one fifth of the total polysomes in the leaves. Analysis of the translation products of membrane-bound polysomes by SDS-PAGE showed them to be of higher average molecular weight than those from free polysomes. Comparison of polypeptides produced by membrane-bound polysomes from healthy and inoculated plants showed some differences however the low yield of membrane-bound polysomes made it difficult to obtain conclusive results.  Thus it was decided to isolate total polysomes by including 1% Triton X-100 in the extraction buffer. Polysomes were extracted from 12 to 72 h after inoculation. Infection caused a decline in yield of polysomes during this period when compared with healthy leaves of the same age. Polysomes isolated 16 h after inoculation with the virulent race were 20% less efficient at translation than polysomes from control leaves. In contrast polysome isolated from leaves inoculated with the avirulent race were 20% more efficient. Analysis of the labelled translation products by SDS-PAGE and fluorography showed relative increases in the synthesis of some proteins by 16 h after inoculation with either race when compared to products from healthy leaves.  Protein synthesis in the infected plants was further analysed by in vivo labelling and one- and two-dimensional PAGE. The fluorographs revealed increased synthesis of a group of proteins from 58 to 116 kDa starting 12 h after inoculation with either race of P. hordei; confirming the results from the polysome translations. Two polypeptides with molecular weights of about 66 kDa were found to increase following infection only with the virulent race. By three days after inoculation with either fungal race the most obvious change in protein synthesis was a marked decrease in the synthesis of the two most prominent polypeptides with molecular weights of 15 and 51 kDa which were considered to be the subunits of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.  The elicitor hypothesis, in attempting to explain cultivar-specific resistance in plants, postulates that resistance is controlled by the interaction of specific fungal elicitors and plant receptors and that this interaction which only occurs between resistant hosts and avirulent pathogens triggers specific gene expression leading to resistance. This hypothesis does not fit the situation in the barley-P. hordei interaction as protein synthesis showed similar changes following infection with either a virulent or an avirulent race.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cereals</field><field name="subject">barley</field><field name="subject">Puccinia hordei</field><field name="subject">cultivar-specific</field><field name="subject">disease resistance</field><field name="subject">polysomes</field><field name="subject">proteins</field><field name="subject">membrane-bound</field><field name="subject">translation</field><field name="subject">two-dimensional</field><field name="subject">electrophoresis</field><field name="subject">rubisco</field><field name="subject">plant pathogens</field><field name="subject">060704 - Plant Pathology</field><field name="subject">070308 - Crop and Pasture Protection (Pests, Diseases and Weeds)</field><field name="subject">060702 - Plant Cell and Molecular Biology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1950</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal control of irrigation systems : an analysis of water allocation rules</field><field name="creator">Bright, John Charles</field><field name="description">A feasibility study of an irrigation development proposal should include an analysis of the effects of water supply conditions on the degree to which development objectives are expected to be realised. A method of making this analysis was developed based on procedures for solving two problems. These were; (a) optimally allocating a property's available supply of water among competing crops, and, (b) optimally controlling an open channel distribution system to meet temporally and spatially varying water demand. The procedure developed for solving (a) was applied.  A stochastic dynamic programming procedure was developed to optimally schedule the irrigation of a single crop, subject to constraints on the timing of water availability and total application depth. A second procedure was developed, employing a constrained differential dynamic programming algorithm, for determining optimal irrigation schedules for use with variable application depth systems, and when several crops compete for an intra-seasonally limited supply of water. This procedure was called, as frequently as water supply conditions allowed, to provide short-term irrigation schedules in a computer simulation of the optimal irrigation of several crops. An application system model was included in these procedures to transform a crop water-use production function into the required irrigation water-use production function. This transformation was a function of the application device type and the mean application depth.  From an analysis of the on-property effects of water supply conditions, it was concluded that in order to achieve high economic and irrigation efficiencies, water supply conditions must be sufficiently flexible to allow the application system operator to vary the mean application depth but not necessarily the time periods of water availability. Additionally, irrigation scheduling procedures which seek economically optimum strategies offer the potential to achieve a maximum level of net benefit at levels of water availability significantly lower than has previously been used for design purposes.</field><field name="date">1986</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="subject">stochastic dynamic programming</field><field name="subject">water availability</field><field name="subject">water allocation</field><field name="subject">distribution</field><field name="subject">modelling</field><field name="subject">scheduling</field><field name="subject">water management</field><field name="subject">079901 - Agricultural Hydrology (Drainage, Flooding, Irrigation, Quality, etc.)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2089</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An information system for planning agricultural development in the Kingdom of Tonga</field><field name="creator">Brook, B. A.</field><field name="description">Past development efforts in the Kingdom of Tonga are reviewed in relation to the goals of reducing poverty, unemployment and inequality. It is shown that progress has been strictly limited and evidence is provided to support the view that inadequate attention has been paid to agricultural improvement and rural development.  The components, practices and institutional framework of the Tongan agricultural system are reviewed and possible future avenues of agricultural development are examined. Attention is drawn to those aspects where improvements are needed if agricultural development is to be promoted. These include an expanded programme of research, an upgrading of the agricultura1 extension effort, an overhaul of the 1and tenure system and a substantial improvement in agricultural product marketing; or, in short, an integrated programme of agricultural improvement and rural development.  From a planning viewpoint, there is evidence of inadequate elaboration of development objectives, superficial identification of resources and insufficient knowledge concerning resource interactions, all of which have created confusion and uncertainty, particularly as regards the role of agriculture in the Kingdom's development. As a result, there is a lack of commitment to development efforts generally, and a tendency for activities on the fringes to be pursued at the expense of more fundamental issues. It is concluded that this situation results largely from the lack of an adequate information base, and that before an integrated plan for agricultural improvement can be developed, the network of interrelationships operating within the agricultural system needs to be understood.  An information system is developed with the basic aim of providing information which will facilitate an understanding of how the agricultural system is integrated into the everyday lives of the people of Tonga. The concept adopted recognises the reciprocal relationships involved between agriculture and the rest of the economy. Using a systems research framework, the Tongan household agricultural system is defined in terms of its component parts, their interactive behaviour and their interrelationships. The key variables required for analysis are isolated and the production relationships in which rural households participate are specified. The information system provides for the observation of household decision making with particular reference to the allocation of labour, land use and the disposal of farm produce, and the disposition of cash earnings.  The information framework is based on the premise that land is the most critical resource in Tongan agriculture. Information requirements are specified which will enable an assessment to be made of the effect of a number of factors on 1and productivity. The data collected will also enable valuable insights to be gained into issues such as land utilisation and methods of production; composition and disposition of agricultural output; household food consumption; marketing of agricultural produce; land tenure; sources of household income; net incomes from agriculture; participation in aid projects; and utilisation of loan finance.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subsistence agriculture</field><field name="subject">agricultural development</field><field name="subject">Tonga</field><field name="subject">Tongan economy</field><field name="subject">development plan</field><field name="subject">agricultural commodities</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300903 Sustainable development</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300900 Land, Parks and Agriculture Management::300901 Farm management, rural management and agribusiness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conflict in recreation: the case of mountain-bikers and trampers</field><field name="creator">Horn, Chrys</field><field name="description">Conflict in recreation is a major problem for recreation managers who are trying to provide satisfying experiences for all recreationists. This thesis is about conflict between mountain-bikers and trampers. Mountain-biking has grown in popularity in New Zealand over the last ten years, and these increasing numbers have threatened the quality of walkers' and runners' recreational experiences, particularly in peri-urban areas.  Conflict is a complex social interaction process which occurs around times of change. It involves the interplay of perceptions and attitudes, behaviour, and an incompatible situation. This complexity required the use of a range of methods to successfully understand the conflict between walkers and mountain-bikers.  Like many other recreational conflicts, the conflict between bikers and trampers is asymmetrical - walkers dislike meeting bikers much more than bikers dislike meeting walkers. A majority of walker respondents disliked or strongly disliked meeting bikers on walking tracks. Walkers' questionnaire answers indicated that their greatest concerns with mountain-biking are (in order of decreasing importance) track damage and other environmental damage, personal safety, and the feeling that bikes interrupt their peace and quiet. Further exploration during in-depth interviews show that the perception of these problems are closely related to the way different users feel about that places that they use, and the way meetings with other users can be incorporated into the experiences of the recreationist. For walkers, meeting bikers is far more intrusive than vice-versa.  Political activity aimed at eliminating bikers from many front country areas means that bikers are now developing a dislike of trampers who they see as intolerant and arrogant. Therefore, behaviour affects the escalation of conflict. In addition, wider social change has had an influence on this conflict. Changing economic wellbeing, less regular work hours, a perceived lack of time and a wider choice of activities have all impacted on recreation patterns in peri-urban areas, and on this conflict situation.  In addition, this study has indicated that the concepts of specialisation and substitution may need modification. The use of qualitative methods has highlighted the narrow focus that researchers have used when studying these concepts. Both must be seen more broadly in the context of individuals' changing recreational needs both over the life cycle, and in the face of social change as outlined above.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mountain-biking</field><field name="subject">motivations</field><field name="subject">preferences</field><field name="subject">conflict</field><field name="subject">goal interference</field><field name="subject">social change</field><field name="subject">substitution</field><field name="subject">specialisation theory</field><field name="subject">tramping</field><field name="subject">constraints</field><field name="subject">time deepening</field><field name="subject">Galtung Triangle</field><field name="subject">triangulation of methods</field><field name="subject">surveys</field><field name="subject">trampers</field><field name="subject">walkers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370403 Recreation and leisure studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of GCC demand for tourism services with special reference to Australian tourist resorts</field><field name="creator">Alhemoud, Abdulla</field><field name="description">Tourism is an increasingly important area of Service trade. Every foreign visitor who spends money in a tourist resort/destination contributes to an improvement in the balance of current account of the country to which this resort belongs. With the value of the Australian dollar declining, and given the vast natural resources and beauty offered by Australia, tourism services may well become a key Australian export factor.The literature on marketing of tourism is still in an infant stage. This is because tourism, is a composite service offered by nationals to foreigners. The tourist is a very different customer to the national. In most cases, the tourist speaks a different language, adheres to a different religion, is grown up in a different culture, has different social values, comes from a place with different civilization and is used to different political and legal systems.The GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council, consisting of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates) is a great potential market for the Australian tourist industry. However, very little is known about the demand of GCC consumers for tourism services and the attitudes of these consumers toward various tourist resorts/destinations. Moreover, it is important to know whether GCC consumers would be interested to spend their vacation in Australia and to determine the salient characteristics of those GCC consumers who express interest to do so. However, Australia, should plan effective marketing strategies to maximize the intake of GCC tourists. This thesis is an interdisciplinary study that attempts to analyze the demand of GCC consumers for tourism services and the attitudes of GCC tourists toward various resorts/destinations. A special reference is given to GCC demand for Australian tourist resorts and the marketing strategies needed to maximize this demand. The thesis analyzed the main determinants of aggregate GCC spending on tourism. This is done through development and testing of Single and Simultaneous equation regression models. The econometric results suggest that GCC spending on tourism is subject to a partial adjustment mechanism with significant feedback effects. A surveys was conducted by the researcher during the months of April and May 1999 to find out how the consumers of the GCC countries rate tourist resorts and determine the main demographic factors which may discriminate between those who expressed interest to visit Australia and those who did not. Three random samples, each has 385 members, were collected from three GCC capital cities. The descriptive statistics suggest that the GCC consumers evaluate tourist resorts on 20 criteria. The relative importance of the considered variables varies within each member state and between states. The survey results also suggest that there are differences in the demographic profiles of the various GCC countries, particularly household income and family size. Moreover, The survey results indicate that a significant proportion of GCC consumers consider Australia as a tourist resort.The survey contained a large number of variables, most of which are correlated. The study attempted to examine the relationships among the interrelated variables and represent them in terms of a few underlying factors. This is done through the use of the technique of Factor Analysis. The principal component method, using varimax rotation, reduced the 20 explanatory variables, in each sample, to four factors. These were identified as "cost factor"; "attraction actor";  "convenience factor" and "image factor". Discriminant analysis was used to determine which, if any, of the four factors predict GCC consumers' interest to visit Australian resorts to a statistically significant degree. The results suggest that GCC consumers who are interested in visiting Australia are motivated by the "image factor" while those who are not interested are held back by the "cost factor".Since the GCC citizens have a wide range of choices when it comes to selecting a tourist resort, it was important to identify resorts with similar attributes. This is done through the use of the Cluster Analysis. Multiple discriminant analysis was then used to describe the nature of the differences between clusters and to test these differences for significance. The results of the cluster analysis suggest that the 13 most popular tourist resorts visited by GCC residents can be grouped into four clusters based on five predictors: "Travelling Cost"; Living Expenses", "Entertainment"; "Comfort"; "Attractions and adventures". Multiple Discriminant Analysis identified three discriminant functions. These functions suggest that GCC consumers, who visit the cluster of tourist resorts, which includes Australia, do so for attractions and adventures.The statistical results of the thesis suggest that Australian National and State Tourist Bureaus should approach the job of attracting GCC tourists from a planning point of view. The study develops a tourism-marketing plan for Australian tourist resorts to achieve this goal. A model of perceived service quality is also developed and applied to the Australian hotel industry. Finally the study discussed the marketing-mix of the Australian tourist industry and offered some recommendations to maximize the number of GCC tourists.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judicial independence and accountability: a comparative study of contemporary Bangladesh experience</field><field name="creator">Akkas, Sarkar Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis examines issues of judicial independence and judicial accountability with special reference to public confidence in the judiciary. The central issues of this thesis are the tension between judicial independence and accountability and the ways the two conflicting values may be balanced in the administration of justice to dehver an effective judicial service and win public confidence. The thesis emphasises that proper measures should be taken to maintain judicial independence and at the same time, an adequate system of judicial accountability should be established without undermining the independence of judges.The thesis examines the conditions of judicial independence and accountability in Bangladesh in comparison with general principles, international standards and practices of some countries in the common law tradition. It evaluates the law and practice which have been followed in Bangladesh to deal with various aspects of the judiciary involving the independence and accountability of judges. It reviews the history and current state of the judiciary by analysing a wide range of sources, including constitutional and statutory law, public records, available statistical data and media reports and secondary literature. The thesis identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the current system of constitutional and judicial administration in Bangladesh and their impacts on judicial independence and judicial accountability which include appointment, tenure and discipline of judges, and scrutiny of judges by the media and the bar. It proposes ways of preserving the strengths or remedying the weaknesses to improve the conditions of judicial independence and judicial accountability in Bangladesh.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://ro.uow.edu.au/theses/1856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Memory processes in posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="creator">Kenny, Lucy Margaret, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of PTSD propose that impaired retrieval of trauma memories may impede processing of these memories and subsequent trauma recovery. This thesis investigated memory retrieval processes in trauma survivors with and without symptoms of posttraumatic stress, and in non-traumatised individuals exposed to a highly arousing event. Study 1 examined deliberate avoidance of unwanted memories in recent trauma survivors. The results indicated that attempts to forget were associated with poorer recall of forgotten information, but the size of this effect did not depend on the presence or absence of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD). Study 2 investigated automatic retrieval inhibition in trauma survivors with or without Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The results suggested that repeated retrieval of trauma-related information by individuals with PTSD can cause inhibition of related, but unpractised information. Studies 3 and 4 examined the relationship between the vantage point of trauma memories, avoidance and posttraumatic stress symptomatology. The findings indicated that recalling a traumatic event from an observer perspective is associated with post trauma avoidance. They also showed that an observer vantage point in the initial few weeks after trauma is associated with poorer long-term post trauma adjustment. Studies 5, 6 and 7 were analogue studies which analysed the impact of heightened arousal on memory retrieval in novice skydivers. The results suggested that elevated arousal can interfere with retrieval of information related to the arousal-inducing event. Study 7 also indicated that autobiographical memory for the event may be impaired. Finally, Study 8 examined the qualities of trauma memories that were accessed via different modes of retrieval. The results provided evidence that intrusive memories were experienced as more realistic and with more intense affect than memories for the same event that were deliberately retrieved. Together, the findings of this program of research extend current  theories of PTSD by highlighting the mechanisms through which retrieval of trauma memories may be impaired. The results suggest that the quality of trauma memories is affected by avoidance processes, elevated arousal and level of conscious control the individual exerts over retrieval.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">Psychic trauma</field><field name="subject">Memory</field><field name="subject">Stress (Psychology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An evaluation of activation and implementation of the medical emergency team system</field><field name="creator">Cretikos, Michelle, School of Anaesthetics, Intensive Care &amp; Emergency Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Problem investigated: The activation and implementation of the Medical Emergency Team (MET) system. Procedures followed: The ability of the objective activation criteria to accurately identify patients at risk of three serious adverse events (cardiac arrest, unexpected death and unplanned intensive care admission) was assessed using a nested, matched case-control study. Sensitivity, specificity and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) analyses were performed. The MET implementation process was studied using two convenience sample surveys of the nursing staff from the general wards of twelve intervention hospitals. These surveys measured the awareness and understanding of the MET system, level of attendance at MET education sessions, knowledge of the activation criteria, level of intention to call the MET and overall attitude to the MET system, and the hospital level of support for change, hospital capability and hospital culture. The association of these measures with the intention to call the MET and the level of MET utilisation was assessed using nonparametric  correlation.  Results obtained: The respiratory rate was missing in 20% of subjects. Using listwise deletion, the set of objective activation criteria investigated predicted an adverse event within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 55.4% (50.6-60.0%) and specificity of 93.7% (91.2-95.6%). An analysis approach that assumed the missing values would not have resulted in MET activation provided a sensitivity of 50.4% (45.7- 55.2%) and specificity of 93.3% (90.8-95.3%). Alternative models with modified cut-off values provided different results. The MET system was implemented with variable success during the MERIT study. Knowledge and understanding of the system, hospital readiness, and a positive attitude were all significantly positively associated with MET system utilisation, while defensive hospital cultures were negatively associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Major conclusions: The objective activation criteria studied have acceptable accuracy, but modification of the criteria may be considered. A satisfactory trade-off between the identification of patients at risk and workload requirements may be difficult to achieve. Measures of effectiveness of the implementation process may be associated with the level of MET system utilisation. Trials of the MET system should ensure good knowledge and understanding of the system, particularly amongst nursing staff.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emergency medical personnel</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine</field><field name="subject">Intensive care units - Evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/25720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contextualizing implementation of the community health program: a case study of the Hunter region, New South Wales 1974 -1989</field><field name="creator">Schulz - Robinson, Shirley, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">How health care is best provided remains topical, contentious, and political. Debates continue over funding allocation and the weighting placed on preventive, curative, institutional and community services. Such debates were evident in 1973 when a new Federal Labor Government began to reform Australia's health system by implementing a national Community Health Program policy. Implementation led to the establishment of community health centres and multi-disciplinary teams. Studies have generally concluded that community health centre teams have ???failed??? to achieve the goals of this policy. This study sought to answer one broad question. How was the community health program policy implemented, in what context did this event occur, what processes were used and why, and how did generalist community nurses participate? This case study of the Hunter Region, New South Wales, between 1974 and 1989, was based on data collected from four sources: over five hundred documents and archives, including relevant literature, epidemiological studies, centre records, official government and newspaper reports; 69 in-depth interviews with practitioners and administrators; and participant observation. The findings revealed that  implementation was hindered by political, administrative and professional impediments. However, practitioners established and provided a broad range of relevant new services by changing the way they practised. Generalist community nurses worked with non-government, private and public organisations offering health, educational and social services. As boundary riders they filled structural holes and created social capital. Conclusions drawn were first, that context strongly influenced how public health policies were implemented and the services offered by different discipline groups. Second, teamwork would have been improved had pre-service health professional education fostered a common understanding of the aim of health care and the broader determinants of health. Third, a preventive orientation needed reinforcing via an organisational context, administrative processes, ongoing learning opportunities and leadership. Fourth, generalist community nurses??? commitment to a preventive approach was embedded in a growing understanding of people's circumstances and health problems. Finally, while policy implementation was constrained in the Hunter Region during the study period it achieved what its architects intended, that is, a broader mix of accessible services, and collaboration between organisations and groups as the boundaries that maintained their separation were bridged.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Health Program (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Community health services _ New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="subject">Public health - New South Wales - Case studies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/26248</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge based anomaly detection</field><field name="creator">Prayote, Akara, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Traffic anomaly detection is a standard task for network administrators, who with experience can generally differentiate anomalous traffic from normal traffic. Many approaches have been proposed to automate this task. Most of them attempt to develop a sufficiently sophisticated model to represent the full range of normal traffic behaviour. There are significant disadvantages to this approach. Firstly, a large amount of training data for all acceptable traffic patterns is required to train the model. For example, it can be perfectly obvious to an administrator how traffic changes on public holidays, but very difficult, if not impossible, for a general model to learn to cover such irregular or ad-hoc situations.   In contrast, in the proposed method, a number of models are gradually created to cover a variety of seen patterns, while in use. Each model covers a specific region in the problem space. Any novel or ad-hoc patterns can be covered easily. The underlying technique is a knowledge  acquisition approach named Ripple Down Rules. In essence we use Ripple Down Rules to partition a domain, and add new partitions as new situations are identified. Within each supposedly homogeneous partition we use fairly simple statistical techniques to identify anomalous data. The special feature of these statistics is that they are reasonably robust with small amounts of data. This critical situation occurs whenever a new partition is added.  We have developed a two knowledge base approach. One knowledge base partitions the domain. Within each domain statistics are accumulated on a number of different parameters. The resultant data are passed to a knowledge base which decides whether enough parameters are anomalous to raise an alarm. We evaluated the approach on real network data. The results compare favourably with other techniques, but with the advantage that the RDR approach allows new patterns of use to be rapidly added to the model.  We also used the approach to extend previous work on prudent expert systems - expert systems that warn when a case is outside its range of experience. Of particular significance we were able to reduce the false positive to about 5%.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Security measures.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks -- Access control.</field><field name="subject">Computer security.</field><field name="subject">Data protection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic skylines on uncertain data</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Bin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Skyline analysis is important for multi-criteria decision making applications. The data in some of these applications are inherently uncertain due to various factors. Although a considerable amount of research has been dedicated separately to efficient skyline computation, as well as modeling uncertain data and answering some types of queries on uncertain data, how to conduct skyline analysis on uncertain data remains an open problem at large. In this thesis, we tackle the problem of skyline analysis on uncertain data. We propose a novel probabilistic skyline model where an uncertain object may take a probability to be in the skyline, and a p-skyline contains all the objects whose skyline probabilities are at least p.   Computing probabilistic skylines on large uncertain data sets is challenging. An uncertain object is conceptually described by a probability density function (PDF) in the continuous case, or in the discrete case a set of instances (points) such that each instance has a probability to appear. We develop two efficient algorithms, the bottom-up and top-down algorithms, of computing p-skyline of a set of uncertain objects in the discrete case. We also discuss that our techniques can be applied to the continuous case as well.  The bottom-up algorithm computes the skyline probabilities of some selected instances of uncertain objects, and uses those instances to prune other instances and uncertain objects effectively. The top-down algorithm recursively partitions the instances of uncertain objects into subsets, and prunes subsets and objects aggressively. Our experimental results on both the real NBA player data set and the benchmark synthetic data sets show that probabilistic skylines are interesting and useful, and our two algorithms are efficient on large data sets, and complementary to each other in performance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uncertainty (Information theory)</field><field name="subject">Skyline queries.</field><field name="subject">Database management.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Computer simulations.</field><field name="subject">Probabilities -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A software system for radionuclide dosimetry with applications.</field><field name="creator">McKay, Erin, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Radiation dosimetry is necessary for optimising radiation-based medical procedures for individual patients but in the field of nuclear medicine there are few widely available or widely used tools for performing this kind of analysis. Those tools that are available tend to focus on one particular component of the dosimetry problem and integrating tools to form a complete system is left to the end-user.  A software system for performing individual, image-based dosimetry analysis of nuclear medicine studies has been developed and validated. The system consists of a suite of tools that use common file formats and data models. The tools can be integrated to form applications by means of a simple scripting system. One tool is a gamma camera simulator that can produce realistic images of dynamic activity distributions in planar or tomographic formats. Simulated imaging studies produced by this tool are used to validate the other tools in the system. In addition, the system implements a method of simulation assisted quantitation which is shown to achieve high accuracy in both software and physical phantom studies.  The system is applied to the dosimetry of I-131 Lipiodol, a therapeutic agent used to treat primary and secondary cancers of the liver. Simulation studies are used to validate the analytic methods used. Studies of a series of patients, treated over a period 10 years, are retrospectively analysed using a selection of methods appropriate to the available data.  The results of the analysis demonstrated a large range of lung doses from 1 to 10 Gy/GBq administered. The median absorbed dose in liver was 3 Gy (range 1 - 10 Gy) and the median absorbed dose in tumor was 19 Gy (range 5 - 84 Gy). The large individual variation reinforces the necessity of individualised dosimetry for treatment planning and follow up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry.</field><field name="subject">Radioisotope scanning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40869</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rainbow holograms</field><field name="creator">Rush, Amy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rainbow holography is the medium I have chosen to specialize in. Holography itself uses light as a sculptural element. In regards to my work, rainbow holography stresses the field of experimentation with the light spectrum until a certain point that I define as travelling the superhighway from reality to virtual worlds. My work appears then as the documentation, in the form of rainbow holograms, of this travel. It depicts narrative imagery while capturing the moments I existed in this virtual world set behind the rainbow.  This project aims to present through still, 3D and filmic imagery the co ??? existence of the physical body and its psychological realm. The psychological reality is articulated as a fictional landscape and the rainbow is used as a metaphor for travel between real and virtual worlds. More importantly, I see holography or rainbow holography as a means of crystallising the vision of the unreachable world behind the rainbow. I see my practice as a new way of using this medium by using this rainbow world as subject matter within the rainbow hologram.  By experimenting with combined image processing techniques within rainbow holography, such as analogue white light transmission holograms, full colour digital stereograms, and dot matrix holograms, it becomes possible to generate a synthetic new world. Here each pixel can have the potential to be every color of the rainbow spectrum simultaneously, depending on the angle of the eye of the perceiver. It is here that my investigation through holographic representation has led me to explore and create other worldly landscapes and to extend reality.  Our longing to travel over the rainbow into our imagination is with us from a very young age. For me this desire has lasted well into adulthood and has somehow found itself at the centre of my creations over the last few years. The childlike and na??ve appearance of my imagery has the ability to evoke the feeling in the viewers of the nostalgia they may have felt as a child, when confronted with the intense experience and wonder of the imaginings of the rainbow. My work trades on a misunderstanding that the medium of holography is taken as a direct representation of an existing reality.  My first hologram I???m a rainbow depicts an alter-egotistical projection of myself as a rainbow princess living in a far away fairytale rainbow galaxy, and communicating with earth beings via the technology of the message contained within the hologram. The hologram has often been associated in science fiction with a message to save the planet. This body of work invites viewers to delve into the depths of their imagination, to save this place where I have travelled by believing in it. As in the story of peter pan where the children are asked to clap their hands if they believe in fairies, by others believing in my imagination they are able to save it.  The world within the imagination holds no fixed place; it is a shifting and dynamic space. This quality is shared with the rainbow, which is similarly ephemeral, vanishing and appearing within the eye of the beholder according to weather patterns. The rainbow hologram is a fixed rainbow. When replayed through the eyes of the viewer, the interaction with the real rainbow is recalled, and the viewer enters into the imagination to perceive the work.  Throughout this paper I have referred to concepts and techniques in other fields such as physics, anthropology, art history and theory. My research is by no means intended as primarily a technical examination of the medium of rainbow holography. The holographic environments I have made rearrange elements from the real world with fictitious realities. They make people feel as if they are viewing a world that is real, but which imitates unreal ideas. These holographic environments enable viewers to experience ideas as a real place.  As Rainbow holography is a relatively new medium, and as my own work uses the rainbow as a multi-layered tool I feel it necessary to investigate the appearance of the rainbow in nature and the reaction of humans to the rainbow as a mythical component in ancient cultures. I am interested in investigating how the rainbow has been used a metaphor for travelling from a material world to ???other worlds??? through its presence in various imaging processes through specific art works. The different ways the rainbow has been used have enabled me to more accurately understand my own work as being a nexus between depicting and generating rainbows. Furthermore, in the discussion of the application of rainbow holography I can show that my own work is necessarily different because of the way I am depicting a rainbow to explore undiscovered territory in which I am the author. Finally I look at how holography is perceived by the public, which helps me to explain the way in which my own work is perceived. Deliberately using the idea of an image in its surrounding context has helped to achieve my desired outcome: to make people believe that the world behind the rainbow really does exist and that I have travelled there, and that they too can do so via viewing my work.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rainbow.</field><field name="subject">Art and holography.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/35241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interplay between sexual selection, inbreeding and inbreeding avoidance in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="creator">Zajitschek, Susanne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Inbreeding can have profound negative effects on individuals by reducing fertility and viability. In populations, inbreeding depression can reduce growth rates and increases extinction risk. The aims of this thesis are to investigate inbreeding depression in male guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and to study the evolution of mechanisms for inbreeding avoidance in females, using guppies from a feral population in Queensland, Australia. Male guppies are highly polymorphic in their sexual ornamentation, indeed they show one of the most extreme polymorphisms observed in nature. Female guppies exhibit complex mate choice based on preferences for ornamentation, as well as social context.  I aim is to examine how these factors of inbreeding avoidance alter sexual selection.   In male guppies I found strong inbreeding depression in male sperm numbers, which is amplified under semi-natural compared to laboratory conditions (Chapter 2). Moreover, inbreeding depression results in low fertility under sperm competition: an experiment using artificial insemination techniques reveals that highly inbred males are heavily disadvantaged in gaining paternity (Chapter 3). On population level, inbreeding depression is manifest in reduced growth rates, predominantly in the early stages of inbreeding (Chapter 4). Population growth at inbreeding coefficients f=0.375-0.59 did not seem to lead to inbreeding depression, whereas lower levels of inbreeding reduced population growth. Although the growth rates in inbred populations appear normal, severe inbreeding depression is uncovered after outbred immigrants are added.  Specifically, male immigrants are most efficient in short-term genetic rescue, probably due to insemination of large numbers of females whereas females are limited in the number of eggs they can produce (Chapter 4).  Male ornamental traits show significant inbreeding depression in semi-natural conditions only (Chapters 2 &amp; 3). Inbreeding avoidance mechanisms seem to have evolved in females: they prefer courtship displays of non-inbred males (Chapter 2), unfamiliar males (Chapter 5) and males with rare patterns (Chapter 6). This preference might increase the mating success of immigrants, and may have evolved to facilitate the avoidance of inbreeding. Together with context-independent preferences for ornament combinations (Chapter 6), it also offers an explanation for the maintenance of polymorphism in this species.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guppy</field><field name="subject">sexual selection</field><field name="subject">inbreeding avoidance</field><field name="subject">Poecilia reticulata</field><field name="subject">mate choice</field><field name="subject">familiarity</field><field name="subject">female preference</field><field name="subject">inbreeding depression</field><field name="subject">sperm competition,</field><field name="subject">complex traits</field><field name="subject">selection analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41218</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersion of two dimensional coflowing jet in the intermediate field</field><field name="creator">Guo, Hong Wei, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">An analytical dispersion model has been derived to determine the distribution of velocities and concentrations of a tracer in a two-dimensional jet in a coflowing ambient fluid. The particular novelty of this model is that it bridges the gap between near-field (where initial momentum dominates behaviour) and far-field (where ambient turbulence is more important) domains. We describe this domain as the ???intermediate field???. In a literature review of coflowing jets we find several laboratory studies and models which can predict the velocities (and in some cases concentrations) in a 2D jet, however they all have shortcomings. None could fully account for ambient turbulence, and all were strictly near-field, i.e. they are unable to describe behaviour when ambient turbulence dominates the initial shear. A brief review of analytical far-field models was also undertaken. There are standard solutions for the dispersion of a 2D continuous source but none that allow for an initial source momentum or non-uniform velocity. As opposed to the near-field coflow approach used by other researchers we start from the far-field, modifying the simple diffusion models by perturbing the governing equations to allow for the initial momentum. Models are developed for both along-stream velocity and the concentration field of a tracer. From the velocity model, a comparison is made with experimental data available from one researcher (Wang, 1996) and an existing near-field coflow model PJCMERG (Davidson, 1989). The initial conditions (width and excess velocity) for our model are determined by Gaussian curve fitting to an arbitrary point in the near-field. The diffusivity parameter is used to adjust (tune) the model until the centreline velocity profile matches. We can always achieve this match and to a much closer degree than PJCMERG. There are no available laboratory or field data for concentrations of a tracer in a 2D coflowing jet although the near-field model PJCMERG does have a tracer component. We demonstrate how PJCMERG cannot converge to any far-field model, while our model provides a neat transition between the near-field and far-field. We have started the extension of the 2D model to the more common 3D situation although we have yet to carry out any comparisons with other models or data. The model development is included in an appendix for other researchers to pick up.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">two-dimensional jet</field><field name="subject">2D jet</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">mathematical models</field><field name="subject">fluid mechanics</field><field name="subject">velocity</field><field name="subject">far-field model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/38726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poverty, gender &amp; community development: The lived experiences of slum-dwelling women in Nairobi</field><field name="creator">Muli, Chrisanta Kanini, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores poverty and community development in the slums of Nairobi. It theorises on the nature of slum-dwelling women's lived experiences of poverty within a patriarchal society, and highlights not only their lack of financial capacity to address household needs, but also their lack of capabilities in terms of social and economic rights. The study provides identification and analysis of the significant role that slum-dwelling women play in community development initiatives. It proposes that these women??s individual and collective experiences of poverty, within Kenyan patriarchal society, are the fundamental motivation for them to engage in community development within their communities.  Critical concepts and theories driving the study are poverty, gender and community development, contextualised within the Kenyan state and society. A qualitative methodology was used, employing a participatory action research framework. A number of qualitative methods were applied: focus groups, semi-structured in-depth individual interviews, and documentary analysis. Women from three women??s groups based in Nairobi slums participated and were co-researchers. Guided by the ??voices?? of slum-dwelling women, this thesis changed its original orientation concerning the use of information technology to an exploration of slum-dwelling women??s lived experiences of poverty. It is argued that these experiences catapulted the women into ??home-grown?? community development initiatives. Their lack of 'access' to fundamental resources and services is attributed, in large part, to the neo-colonial and patriarchal nature of Kenyan society that has perpetuated and compounded gender biases and inequality. This study identifies a disconnection between formal definitions of poverty and any resulting ??imposed?? community development initiatives, and the women??s analyses of their own priorities and needs. The women??s multi-level and intersectorial understanding of poverty, and their ??home-grown?? community development initiatives offer a finely contextualised, responsive and capacity-building alternative approach to addressing the reality of their poverty. This thesis proposes that for slum-dwelling women in Nairobi to benefit from community development, such development must be based upon their contextualised, class- and gender-framed definitions of poverty. This can be understood as the next generation of community development that is neither imposed nor externally managed, but emerges from the people, in this case the women in the slums of Nairobi who are experiencing the poverty. This emerging community development is generated from and by the women??s analyses of the disconnection, corruption and failure of current development approaches.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysing tacit collusion in oligopolistic electricity markets using a co-evolutionary approach</field><field name="creator">Thai, Doan Hoang Cau, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wholesale electricity markets now operate in many countries around the world. These markets determine a spot price for electricity as the clearing price when generators bid in energy at various prices. As the trading in a wholesale electricity market can be seen as a dynamic repeated game, it would be expected that profit maximising generators learn to engage in tacit collusion to profitably increase spot market prices. This thesis investigates this tacit collusion of generators in oligopolistic electricity markets. We do not follow the approach of previous work in game theory that presupposes firms' collusive strategies to enforce collusion in an oligopoly. Instead, we develop a co-evolutionary approach (extending previous work in this area) using a genetic algorithm (GA) to co-evolve strategies for all generators in some stylised models of an electricity market. The bidding strategy of each generator is modelled as a set of bidding actions, one for each possible discrete state of the state space observed by the generator. The market trading interactions are simulated to determine the fitness of a particular strategy. The tacitly collusive outcomes and strategies emerging from computational experiments are thus obtained from the learning or evolutionary process instead of from any pre-specification. Analysing many of those emergent collusive outcomes and strategies. we are able to specify the mechanism of tacit collusion and investigate how the market environment can affect it. We find that the learned collusive strategies are similar to the forgiving trigger strategies of classical supergame theory (Green and Porter, 1984). Also using computational experiments, we can determine which characteristics of the market environment encourage or hinder tacit collusion. The findings from this thesis provide insights on tacit collusion in an oligopoly and policy implications from a learning perspective. With modelling flexibility, our co-evolutionary approach can be extended to study strategic behaviour in an oligopoly considering many other market characteristics.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Price fixing -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Finance -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Electric power systems -- Economic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Oligopolies -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating the effectiveness of Australian aid to Samoa</field><field name="creator">Hamblin, William John, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">On a global basis over A$450 billion is invested each year in foreign direct investment and aid with a view to supporting development. Developing countries themselves allocate significant sums out of their own budgets in order to stimulate development. Development is concomitantly a major goal and enterprise of the global economy. Developed countries through aid (Official Development Assistance) spend large sums purportedly to improve the development status of developing countries. Recently voices from within the developed world???s establishment have derided the performance of aid and by default the performance of state organisations charged with managing aid delivery. Australia has not been immune from this criticism. Its aid program while modest by global standards still consumes A$1.5 billion in taxpayers money each year. Australian aid is delivered primarily by the Australian International Aid Agency (AusAID) with smaller contributions through the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Defence and Australian Federal Police. AusAID has recently faced severe criticism over failure of the aid investment in the South Pacific to engender development. Most South Pacific countries (excluding Fiji and Samoa) have failed to show desired development. A number have faced bankruptcy (Naru, Solomon Islands), while others have increasing lawlessness (Papua New Guinea). It is important in the above milieu to examine the delivery mechanisms of Australian aid through its chosen vehicle (AusAID) and determine whether aid has really been effective or not. This thesis reviews the development effectiveness of Australian aid in one Pacific island nation ??? Samoa. In this context, the effectiveness of Australian development assistance is reviewed in terms of the results of four case studies of project aid to Samoa. The four case studies cover a range of project activity in differing sectors and offer specific insights into aid policy and delivery and the effects other variables such as culture, history and development status have on development outcomes. The thesis tests the hypothesis that Australian aid to Samoa has resulted in only limited development success and then in ways that are not generally sustainable. In confirming the hypothesis, this thesis identifies that while variables such as the procedural and policy underpinnings of the Australian aid program, aid design/delivery and management, and the history, culture and development status of Samoa impact on the development outcomes, they do not prohibit development. This thesis concludes that development outcomes will be maximised when there are good macro policies present, sound sector policies and real commitments of the government and people to development. Moreover, this thesis finds that while development theories inform the debate over aid none successfully encapsulates  the actual development process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for sustainable building tools</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yu, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sustainable building (SB) tools have been recognized and explored in different regions as among the most effective means to encourage, regulate and assist SB development. A large variety of SB tools have been developed and applied in the marketplace, while a number of new tools emerge each year. While the early-developed SB tools provide general references and resources, it is still not easy either to select from existing tools, to develop new tools, or to customize existing tools for any specific region. On the one hand, the quickly expanding number of tools is developed with different styles, contents, functions, underlying assumptions as well as limitations relating to the specific conditions in their origin regions. Without a comprehensive framework to classify the tools, it is difficult to select the right ones out for any specific task in hand. On the other hand, the conditions and requirements for developing SB tools in a specific region are multi-faceted and complex. Without a proper understanding of them from a holistic point of view, it is difficult to say which tools or which type of tools are indeed needed and appropriate in a region. Recognizing the demand for developing and applying specific SB tools in different regions and the confusion surrounding existing tools, this research establishes two comprehensive conceptual frameworks to classify SB tools and SB issues. The framework for SB tools includes four related categories that focus on building stakeholders, building activities, buildings, and building performances. The framework for SB issues constitutes two combined hierarchy structures each for the performance (P) factors and the decision-making (D) factors respectively. These two frameworks not only serve as guides toward identifying the types of tools (existing or not) that are needed and suitable in a specific region, but also facilitate the selection and customization of existing tools for specific regions.  Guided by the two generic frameworks established in the research, China specific conditions and requirements for SB tools are investigated. China specific SB issues are first identified from three preliminary SB tools in the country and classified according to the generic frameworks for SB issues. A questionnaire survey targeting local architects is then conducted in four selected cities. Answers in the replied questionnaires are analysed with the SPSS software and the Content Analysis method. Local architects??? perception about the relative importance of SB issues and their preferences and expectation about the characters, orientations, functions and styles of SB tools are identified and compared with that in existing SB tools. Accordingly, similarities and contradictions between existing tools and local architects??? perceptions, preferences, and expectations regarding China specific SB tools are summarized and discussed. Synthesizing the above research and investigation about the generic and regionally specific aspects of SB tools, this thesis finally proposes a holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools. First, a more balanced approach for developing SB tools in both the broad and narrow senses is proposed and discussed; second, a suite approach for developing SB tools in both the functional and spatial dimensions is proposed and discussed. Conceptual frameworks are established in the discussions; examples are provided to illustrate the concepts; and recommendations are made for further development of the generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools in China.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable buildings</field><field name="subject">sustainable architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust control and state estimation via limited capacity communication networks</field><field name="creator">Malyavej, Veerachai, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Telecommunication networks become major parts in modern complex control systems recently. They provide many advantages over conventional point-to-point connections, such as the simplification on installation and maintenance with comparatively low cost and the nature requirement of wireless communication in remote control systems. In practice, limited resource networks are shared by multiple controllers, sensors and actuators, and they may need to serve some other information unrelated to control purpose. Consequently, the control system design in networked control systems should be revised by taking communication constraints, for example, finite precision data, time delay and noise in transmission, into account. This thesis studies the robust control and state estimation of uncertain systems, when feedback information is sent via limited capacity communication channels. It focuses on the problem of finite precision data due to the communication constraints. The proposed schemes are based on the robust set-valued state estimation and the optimal control techniques.  A state estimation problem of linear uncertain system is studied first. In this problem, we propose an algorithm called coder-decoder for uncertain systems. The coder encodes the observed output into a finite-length codeword and sends it to the decoder that generates the estimated state based on the received codeword. As an illustration, we apply the results in state estimation problem to a precision missile guidance problem using sensor fusion. In this problem, the information obtained from remote sensors is transmitted through limited capacity communication networks to the guided missile. Next, we study a stabilization problem of linear uncertain systems with state feedback. In this problem, the coder-controller scheme is developed to asymptotically stabilize the uncertain systems via limited capacity communication channels. The coder encodes the full state variable into a finite-length codeword and sends it to the controller that drives the system state to the origin. To achieve the asymptotic stability, we use a dynamic quantizer so that quantization noise converges to zero.  The results in both state estimation and stabilization problems can handle the problem of finite data rate communication networks in control systems.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust control</field><field name="subject">Estimation theory</field><field name="subject">Telecommunication</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23981</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial CaCO3 precipitation for the production of biocement</field><field name="creator">vicky.whiffin@sydneywater.com.au</field><field name="description">The hydrolysis of urea by the widely distributed enzyme urease is special in that it is one of the few biologically occurring reactions that can generate carbonate ions without an associated production of protons. When this hydrolysis occurs in a calcium-rich environment, calcite (calcium carbonate) precipitates from solution forming a solid-crystalline material. The binding strength of the precipitated crystals is highly dependent on the rate of carbonate formation and under suitable conditions it is possible to control the reaction to generate hard binding calcite cement (or Biocement). The objective of this thesis was to develop an industrially suitable cost-effective microbial process for the production of urease active cells and investigate the potential for urease active cells to act as a catalyst for the production of Biocement.

The biocementation capability of two suitable strains was compared. Sporosarcina pasteurii (formally Bacillus pasteurii) produced significantly higher levels of urease activity compared to Proteus vulgaris, however the level of urease activity was variable with respect to biomass suggesting that the enzyme was not constitutive as indicated by the literature, but subject to regulation. The environmental and physiological conditions for maximum urease activity in S. pasteurii were investigated and it was found that the potential urease capacity of the organism was very high (29 mM urea.min-1.OD-1) and sufficient for biocementation without additional processing (e.g. concentration, cell lysis). The regulation mechanism for S. pasteurii urease was not fully elucidated in this study, however it was shown that low specific urease activity was not due to depletion of urea nor due to the high concentrations of the main reaction product, ammonium. pH conditions were shown to have a regulatory effect on urease but it was evident that another co-regulating mechanism existed. Despite not fully exploiting the urease capability of S. pasteurii, sufficient urease activity to allow direct application of the enzyme without additional processing could still be achieved and the organism was considered suitable for biocementation.

Urease was the most expensive component of the cementation process and cost-efficient production was desired, thus an economic growth procedure was developed for large-scale cultivation of S. pasteurii. The organism is a moderate alkaliphile (growth optimum pH 9.25) and it was shown that sufficient activity for biocementation could be cultivated in non-sterile conditions with a minimum of upstream and downstream processing. The cultivation medium was economised and expensive components were replace with a food-grade protein source and acetate, which lowered production costs by 95%. A high level of urease activity (21 mM urea hydrolysed.min-1) was produced in the new medium at a low cost ($0.20 (AUD) per L).

The performance of urease in whole S. pasteurii cells was evaluated under biocementation conditions (i.e. presence of high concentrations of urea, Ca2+, NH4 +/NH3, NO3 - and Cl- ions). It was established that the rate of urea hydrolysis was not constant during cementation, but largely controlled by the external concentrations of urea and calcium, which constantly changed during cementation due to precipitation of solid calcium carbonate from the system. A simple model was generated that predicted the change in urea hydrolysis rate over the course of cementation. It was shown that whole cell S. pasteurii urease was tolerant to concentrations of up to 3 M urea and 2 M calcium, and the rate of urea hydrolysis was unaffected up to by 3 M ammonium. This allowed the controlled precipitation of up to 1.5 M CaCO3 within one treatment, and indicated that the enzyme was very stable inspite of extreme chemical conditions.

A cost-efficient cementation procedure for the production of high cementation strength was developed. Several biocementation trials were conducted into order to optimise the imparted cementation strength by determining the effect of urea hydrolysis rate on the development of strength. It was shown that high cementation strength was produced at low urea hydrolysis rates and that the development of cementation strength was not linear over the course of the reaction but mostly occurred in the first few hours of the reaction. In addition, the whole cell bacterial enzyme had capacity to be immobilised in the cementation material and re-used to subsequent applications, offering a significant cost-saving to the process.

An industry-sponsored trial was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of Biocement for increasing in-situ strength and stiffness of two different sandy soils; (a) Koolschijn sand and (b) 90% Koolschijn sand mixed with 10% peat (Holland Veen). After biocementation treatment, Koolschijn sand indicated a shear strength of 1.8 MPa and a stiffness of 250 MPa, which represents an 8-fold and 3-fold respective improvement in strength compared to unconsolidated sand. Significantly lower strength improvements were observed in sand mixed with peat.

In combination, trials of producing bacteria under economically acceptable conditions and cementation trials support the possibility of on-site production and in-situ application of large field applications.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Urease</field><field name="subject">calcium</field><field name="subject">carbonate precipitation</field><field name="subject">bacteria.</field><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20041101.142604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD.

Grinding is a standing position cyclic upper body task requiring manual arm cranking of winches, which control movement of the mast and sails. Limited information exists on biomechanical factors involved in grinding performance. This thesis determined technique and muscular performance characteristics of sailors related to grinding performance, and effects of a training intervention on grinding performance. Reliability of grinding ergometer performance testing was evaluated across direction, load and heel conditions. In all conditions relative performance between individuals was consistent (r = 0.84-0.99) and the grinding performance test differentiated well between individuals. External work had lower overall variation (1.6-3.9%) than peak power (1.3-5.4%), especially when grinding against greater loads. Grinding performance was less consistent in heeled conditions (4.6-6.9%) than on the flat, but grinding direction did not affect reliability. Performance changes over 4% could be interpreted with confidence. Peak torque occurred at 95&#176; (77 N m) and 35&#176; (69 N m) for forward and backward grinding respectively (0&#176; = grinding crank vertically up). Torque of &gt;50 N m was maintained through 72% of the cycle during forward grinding but only 47% for backward grinding. Differences were attributed to a greater spread of active muscles throughout the cycle for forward grinding, and contrasting movements contributing most to torque &#8211; upper body push for forward grinding and pull for backward grinding. Variant characteristics of the two grinding directions provide some explanation for the significant advantage (+8.0%, p&lt;0.001) when grinding in pairs with an anterior-posterior heel compared to a medio-lateral heel. Movement characteristics did not readily explain why an anterior-posterior heel may be more advantageous under higher grinding loads (1.0%, p = 0.254), while medio-lateral heel is better at lower loads (2.0%, p = 0.017). Muscular performance of sailors, examined using an instrumented Smith machine, showed force and 1RM strength were greater in the bench press by ~17%. Velocity and power output were greater for the bench pull across the range of loads with the difference increasing exponentially as load increased to over 400% higher at 1RM load. Bench press 1RM and maximum force capability demonstrated strongest correlations with forward grinding performance (r = 0.88-0.99 and 0.87-0.99 respectively) with the relationship increasing with grinding load. There was a strong relationship for backward grinding with bench pull maximum power (r = 0.85-0.98) in addition to 1RM (r = 0.90-0.95) and maximum force (r = 0.87-0.95). Backward grinding performance showed greater improvements in the power-focussed training group than the control group for moderate (+1.8%) and heavy load (+6.0%) grinding in the intervention study. Changes in maximum power output and power at 1RM had large correlations (r = 0.56-0.61) with changes in both moderate and heavy load grinding performance. Time to peak force explained 70% of the change in heavy load grinding performance. Performance benefits from the training intervention were not entirely clear, but the likelihood of a detrimental effect was low (&lt;5%), therefore further training intervention was recommended.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yachting</field><field name="subject">Movement analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Student attitudes towards and perceptions of ePortfolios in a first year Japanese language programme</field><field name="creator">Moffat, Sonja</field><field name="description">Research into learner autonomy has confirmed the importance of learner competencies such as effective strategy use, goal setting and planning, maintaining motivation, and the ability to reflect and self-evaluate to the development of autonomy. The introduction of key competency frameworks to develop learner autonomy has been a focus of recent curriculum development from primary through to tertiary levels in the New Zealand education system.  However, facilitating and managing the development of these learning competencies in a programme of study that has a number of different papers and staff, can be problematic. The learning portfolio is emerging as a possible medium to provide the required framework.  This study investigated the effectiveness of an ePortolio in enhancing learner autonomy in the context of a language learning programme. The aim of this study was to gain insight from a student perspective into the usfulness of ePortfolios as a tool to enhance student learning. Investigating learner autonomy and the development of self-reflection resulting from the use of ePortfolios was the main focus of the study. It also examined some of the practicalities of using an ePortfolio to develop the desired learner competencies, and discussed whether an ePortfolio provides an effective framework to record, monitor and provide feedback to students. The results of the study reinforce the findings of previous studies in that there are benefits of ePortfolios as they encourage reflection. ePortfolios also have the potential to support the reflective process by making learning outcomes visible and they promote goal-setting. However, despite these apparent benefits, the findings suggest that there are many challenges, which have the potential to negatively influence its effectiveness. The ePortfolio in this study was used with varying degrees of success.  The findings have raised several issues regarding the introduction of an ePortfolio. The time it takes for teachers to give individual feedback and maintain an adequate level of feedback throughout the semester was one major challenge. The extent to which learners need to be trained in the purpose of the ePortfolio and its link to reflection and developing autonomy was another issue that was raised. In addition, getting students to reflect on their learning holistically also proved to be problematic.  Overall however, findings as to the effectiveness of the ePortfolio in promoting autonomous learning appear promising, but they have highlighted the need to make changes to the ePortfolio itself. Its integration into the curriculum needs to be reconsidered to maximize its use and gain maximum benefit.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ePortfolios</field><field name="subject">Portfolios</field><field name="subject">Autonomy</field><field name="subject">Reflection</field><field name="subject">Self-assessment</field><field name="subject">Goal-setting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/925</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic sequence stratigraphy of the intra-Barrow Group, Barrow Sub-basin, Northwest Shelf, Australia.</field><field name="creator">King, Emma Jean</field><field name="description">Regional exploration in the Barrow Sub-basin has dominantly focused on structural traps in the Top Barrow Group. A lack of recent discoveries has focused attention more towards the economic potential of the Early Cretaceous intra-Barrow Group plays. The aim of this study was to interpret the seismic sequence stratigraphy and depositional history of the intra-Barrow Group within the Barrow Sub-basin, with emphasis on the identification of stratigraphic traps and potential locations of economic seal/reservoir couplets within the study area. The study area lies south of Barrow Island, and contains the topsets, foresets and toesets of the &#8216;Barrow delta&#8217;, which are an amalgamation of Mesozoic sandprone fluvial, coastal deltaic and deepwater successions. The final stages of the break-up of Gondwana impacted on the structural development of the Barrow Sub-basin, when a large shelf-margin fluvial/deltaic system built out toward the north to northeast, contributing to northerly shelf margin accretion, with largescale clinoform features and associated depositional environments. The dataset comprises the Flinders 3D seismic survey 1267 km&#178; and 35 well logs. Eleven seismic sequences are identified and a seismic sequence stratigraphic framework tied to the wells has been developed, via detailed sequence stratigraphic mapping, integrated with 3D visualisation techniques with the use of Petrel. These eleven second-order sequences are further subdivided into lowstand, transgressive and highstand systems tracts. The movement of the palaeo-shelf break, slope and base of slope can be traced throughout each sequence, displaying an overall trend of building out in a north to northeast direction. A series of palaeo- geographic maps for each sequence has been developed to illustrate the basin&#8217;s evolution. The seismic sequences identified display progradation, followed by aggradation, then downstepping, concluding with progradation and aggradation. A high-resolution sequence stratigraphic study of Seismic Sequence 1 showed that several higher-order sequences can be identified, including numerous lowstand systems wedges, along with associated channel features, which could be targeted as new plays. The sequence stratigraphic framework developed, palaeo-geographic reconstructions and all other interpretations made for this project have been integrated to assess the prospectivity of the intra-Barrow Group over the study area, resulting in the identification of a number of leads and prospectivity summaries for each of the 11 Seismic Sequences identified within the intra-Barrow Group.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seismic sequence stratigraphy; sequence stratigraphy, Barrow Group; Barrow Sub-basin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional analysis of ANKRD11 and FBXO31: two candidate tumour suppressor genes from the 16q24.3 breast cancer loss of heterozygosity region.</field><field name="creator">Neilsen, Paul Matthew</field><field name="description">Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on the long arm of chromosome 16 is frequently observed during the onset of breast cancer. Our laboratory has recently identified both ANKRD11 and FBXO31 as candidate tumour suppressor genes in the chromosome band 16q24.3, which is the smallest region of overlap for breast cancer LOH. This thesis focuses on the functional analysis of these two novel genes and implicates a role for them as breast cancer tumour suppressors. ANKRD11: a novel p53 coactivator involved in the rescue of mutant p53. The ability of p53 to act as a transcription factor is critical for its function as a tumour suppressor. Ankyrin repeat domain 11 (ANKRD11) was found to be a novel p53-interacting protein which enhanced the transcriptional activity of p53. ANKRD11 expression in breast cancer cell lines was shown to be down-regulated when compared to ANKRD11 expression in finite life-span HMECs and non-malignant immortalized breast epithelial cells. Restoration of ANKRD11 expression in MCF-7 (p53 wild-type) and MDA-MB-468 (p53[superscript R273H] mutant) cells suppressed the oncogenic properties of these breast cancer cell lines through enhancement of p21[superscript waf1] expression. ShRNA-mediated silencing of ANKRD11 reduced the ability of p53 to activate p21[superscript waf1] expression in response to DNA damage. ANKRD11 was shown to associate with the p53 acetyltransferase, P/CAF, and exogenous ANKRD11 expression increased the levels of acetylated p53. Exogenous ANKRD11 expression enhanced the DNA-binding properties of the p53[superscript R273H] mutant to the CDKN1A promoter, implicating a role for ANKRD11 in the restoration of mutant p53[superscript R273H] function. These findings demonstrate a role for ANKRD11 as a p53 coactivator and illustrate the potential of ANKRD11 in the restoration of mutant p53[superscript R273H] function. ANKRD11 has roles beyond that of p53 coactivation. This thesis also presents preliminary findings to suggest that ANKRD11 may be involved in the regulation of eukaryotic cell division. Furthermore, ANKRD11 was shown to function as an estrogen receptor coactivator. Taken together, these finding suggest that ANKRD11 is a multi-functional cancer-related protein. FBXO31: the 16q24.3 senescence gene. A BAC located in the 16q24.3 breast cancer loss of heterozygosity region was previously shown to restore cellular senescence when transferred into breast tumour cell lines. We have shown that FBXO31, although located just distal to this BAC, can induce cellular senescence in the breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and is the likely candidate senescence gene. Exogenous FBXO31 expression inhibited the oncogenic properties of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. In addition, compared to the relative expression in normal breast, levels of FBXO31 were down-regulated in breast tumour cell lines and primary tumours. FBXO31 protein levels were cell cycle regulated, with maximal expression from late G2 to early G1 phase. Ectopic expression of FBXO31 in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 resulted in the accumulation of cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. FBXO31 was also shown to be a component of a SCF ubiquitination complex. We propose that FBXO31 functions as a tumour suppressor by generating SCF[superscript FBXO31] complexes that target particular substrates, critical for the normal execution of the cell cycle, for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">breast cancer; loss of heterozygosity; tumour suppessor genes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass loading and Stokes number effects in steady and unsteady particle-laden jets.</field><field name="creator">Foreman, Richard J.</field><field name="description">In single phase, steady, turbulent axisymmetric jets, the time-averaged velocity field can be characterised by the decay in centreline velocity and increased spread with increasing distance from the jet orifice. In a two-phase or &#8216;particle-laden&#8217; jet, the particles will modulate the jet turbulence and exchange momentum with the gas phase. Consequently, these effects reduce both the centreline velocity decay and spreading rates with respect to the single-phase jet. Empirical exponential scaling factors were found by previous authors to describe the reduced centreline decay and spreading rates well for low Stokes numbers. In this thesis, power-law scaling factors are found to scale well a wide range of centreline velocity decay and spreading rate data published over the past 40 years, for a wide range of Stokes numbers. The power-law scaling is composed of three different regimes. For low Stokes numbers St&#8320;   &#8818;20, it is found that the gas phase centreline velocity, u&#8320;/uc collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;, and the velocity profile half widths r&#8321;/ &#8322; collapse if plotted as a function of x/D(1+&#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;.

For intermediate Stokes numbers, u&#8320;/uc collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185; and r&#8321;/ &#8322; collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;/&#178;. For high Stokes numbers St&#8320; &#8819; 200, u&#8320;/uc collapses if plotted as a function of x/D(1 + &#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;/&#178; and the half width is approximately independent of &#216;&#8320;. In addition to the velocity of the gas phase, other aspects of particle- laden jets are found to be amenable to scaling by power-law functions. It is found that reported solid phase mass flux data scales similarly to gas phase measurements. Limited solid phase concentration and entrainment measurements reported in the literature are also found to scale by power-law functions. Whereas that limited data was obtained from the literature, measurements of the distribution of particles in particle-laden jets were conducted to further assess the validity of the scaling regimes to the solid phase. A planar light scattering technique is conducted to measure the distribution of particles in an axisymmetric jet and their subsequent scaling (or lack thereof) are reported for a variation in &#216;&#8320;, Stokes number and gas phase jet exit density. For Stokes numbers based on the pipe friction velocity St* &#8320;   &#8764; 1, half widths of particle distributions were found to scale with x/D(1+&#216;&#8320;)&#8315;&#185;/&#178; . The apparent centreline concentration was found to be independent of &#216;&#8320; at this same St* &#8320; . For Stokes numbers based on the pipe friction velocity St*&#8320; &lt; 1, half widths are independent of &#216;&#8320;. The effect of the other parameters, i.e. Stokes number and density ratio, on centreline distributions and half widths are also investigated. Measurements of particle distributions, delivered via an annular channel, in a triangular oscillating jet (OJ) flow are also reported for a variation in momentum ratio, the ratio of OJ momentum to channel momentum and mass loading. The results of the variation in momentum ratio on particle distributions are compared with an existing precessing jet (PJ) study. It is the aim of this study to determine the experimental conditions for which the OJ nozzle is superior to the PJ nozzle. The use of an OJ nozzle is preferable at an industrial scale by virtue of its lower driving pressure compared with a PJ nozzle. It is found that particle distributions in a PJ flow spread at a greater rate with increasing momentum ratio compared with the spread of particles in an OJ flow. However, at momentum ratios approximately less than unity, the absolute spread from an OJ is greater. This also corresponds to nozzle driving pressure less than approximately 10kPA. For an increase in mass loading, the spread of particle distribution in the OJ decreases and recirculation increases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiphase flow; turbulent jet; particle-laden jet; two-phase jet; precessing jet; triangular-oscillating jet</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of tartrate stabilisation technologies for wine industry.</field><field name="creator">Low, Lin Lin.</field><field name="description">In the Australian wine industry, cold stabilisation is a widely used industrial process to prevent tartrate instability in bottled wines. This process involves cooling the wine close to its freezing point for extended periods, thereby inducing tartrate precipitation. However, it has several important disadvantages. Consequently, alternative methods to cold stabilisation have been developed. This includes electrodialysis, nanofiltration and contact processes. In this study, current knowledge regarding performance and cost of cold stabilisation and alternative technologies for tartrate stabilisation is reviewed. Whilst there have been occasional cost comparisons between cold stabilisation and alternative technologies, existing data is not suitable for properly evaluating the relative economics of the different process options. Therefore, alternative technologies to cold stabilisation, including the Westfalia process, nanofiltration and electrodialysis were compared for both technical and economic performance. Berri Estates Winery was used as the basis for engineering calculations and conceptual cost estimates. This is the first time that such a comprehensive evaluation has been undertaken of a broad range of alternative technologies for tartrate stabilisation during wine production. Product loss was a key cost driver in differentiating tartrate stabilisation processes. Cold stabilisation was found to be the most economic treatment process irrespective of scale or winery size. The Westfalia process and nanofiltration were the next most cost effective options. Data for economic evaluation and environmental assessment were summarised in a survey form that was circulated to technical experts from Hardy Wine Company, the Australian Wine Research Institute (AWRI) and the University of Adelaide. The purpose of the survey was to obtain the experts&#8217; opinions on the merits of the alternative technologies. The results of this survey were used for comparison between current cold stabilisation and alternative technologies, by performing multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). This represents an original application of MCDA techniques to decision making in the wine industry. The MCDA analysis identified a strong preference by experts for nanofiltration combined with centrifugation as an alternative to cold stabilisation. As a consequence, laboratory investigations and field testing of nanofiltration were conducted to obtain new and practical information which was not presently available and relevant to understanding and implementing this process for tartrate stabilisation of wine. The laboratory experiments were performed with a range of membranes and tartrate unstable wines (i.e. Semillon, Colombard and Shiraz) using a purpose-designed laboratory-scale continuously-stirred batch-test membrane cell. The results showed that a range of commercial nanofiltration membranes with a nominal molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) between 200 and 500 Daltons (Da) were able to achieve tartrate stabilisation of all wines tested. This was achieved at moderate pressures less than 20 bar with a recovery of at least 50 %. It was also observed that seeding of wine following nanofiltration might reduce the holding time required to achieve stability and also enable reductions in the recovery rate to values of less than 50 %. The field testing was performed at Berri Estates Winery in the Riverland region of South Australia. The testing was performed using an existing commercial membrane system. This membrane system was already used for juice/wine concentration. The nanofiltration membranes had a nominal MWCO of 300 Da. The testing was conducted on Colombard and Shiraz wines. The field tests confirmed that nanofiltration could successfully tartrate stabilise Colombard and Shiraz wines at recoveries of 50 %; without seeding; within relatively short holding periods of less than four hours; and at flux rates between 5 and 10 L/m&#178;/h. Crystallisation kinetics were also studied. At low recovery, the crystallisation was initially controlled by diffusion step, then surface integration. However, at high recovery, the crystallisation was controlled solely by surface integration. Sensory testing (by duo-trio difference tests) produced adverse sensory outcomes when compared with treatment of the same wines by cold stabilisation. Unfortunately, it could not be established whether this problem was inherent to the process or arose from unrelated factors. Setting aside the adverse sensory result, this is the first time that technical feasibility of nanofiltration for tartrate stabilisation has been successfully demonstrated. Further field testing and sensory evaluation of nano-filtered wines should be carried out to verify the effect of nanofiltration on wines. If the process is successful and favourable, the process design for implementation of a production scale nanofiltration for tartrate stabilisation should then be optimised.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cold stabilisation; electrodialysis; nanofiltration; multi-criteria analysis; MCDA; sensory analysis; economic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Tu'i Kanokupolu Matai establishment and why would Tu'i Tonga Fuanunuiava have vied to become one? : a genealogical analysis of post 1550 AD new political hegemony in Tonga</field><field name="creator">'Ilaiu, Siaosi L.</field><field name="description">This work examines some issues relating to specific social, political and ideological developments that have shaped the pre-contact history of Tonga especially the puzzling ideas that revolve around the co-existence of the three kingly lines that survived into the era of written record. There are competing versions of how each dynasty came about and what kinds of contribution they accomplished. I endeavour to go further than what current research has brought to light so far. In fact, current research on Tongan history is stagnant due to some great lack in research methodology whereby easy problems cannot be logically deciphered. I believe this is because present disciplinary guidelines limit the scope for attaining a deep understanding of things not to mention the failure of comparative method (comparing chronologies in neighbouring islands) to underpin the historical realities on offer. One of my main concerns in this study rests on how well the contact period reflects the reality of what we may refer to as Tongan tradition or what is really traditional about Tongan ways of life prior to the seventeenth century. This thesis is designed to use Tongan genealogy as a guide in attempting to make sense of what the European records can offer to our understanding of post-contact Tonga. Historical documentation in this context refers simply to post-contact recording of events, whereas traditional history, ordered by genealogy, gives us access to a more distant past. This work argues further that genealogy unravels an ever-presence of conflicting tendencies that existed even in times where Tongan society was perceived to enjoy long-term peace. This thesis is aimed at a complete rethinking of political transformations in ancient Tongan polity and how such transformations introduced new patterns of social, political and ideological realities that current scholars have not yet recognised. I also show how genealogy is useful in determining the course of Tongan political history, especially the major changes that took place a few centuries before contact with Europe came about in the early 17th century AD. In Chapter one, I introduce an alternative theory about the political history of Tonga since the inception of the TK dynasty1. I also delineate how genealogy reflects major changes in all aspects of life in both pre- contact and post-contact Tonga. In the light of this better understanding of Tongan political history I employ Antonio Gramci&#8217;s dialectic to harness and clarify matters relating to social processes in the past that have remained unexplained up to now. I discuss here the hegemony of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga dynasty i.e. how it was achieved and maintained for over a thousand years from 450 AD until around 1500 AD when there was an unsuccessful counter-hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua line. In 1550 shortly after the Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua failure every commentator of Tongan society has overlooked another counter hegemony by the third dynasty. The Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu hegemony will be critically discussed with reference to a further counterhegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga by which strategy the old dynasty managed to survive a bit longer. Chapter 2 then, offers a critique of old notions about Tongan society in works written mostly by the socalled Polynesianist revisionists who have constantly revisited Tongan history for the past two decades. I also show why Tongan traditionalists and scholars alike could not understand what had been happening in Tonga&#8217;s past. This work focuses on the creation of the third dynasty in Tonga around 1550 AD. There are a number of issues relating to this event that have not been discussed by any commentator of Tongan society so far. These include the indirect but significant importation of a quasi-Samoan matai system that eventually formed the basis of Tongan polity encountered by European explorers starting from Souten and Le Maire in 1616 during the reign of the third Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu (Mataeletu&#8217;apiko), when the matai system was locally practised in the narrow confines of Hihifo2. It had gained momentum at the time of Captain Cook&#8217;s last visit in 1777. The system grew stronger and spread to all corners of the Tongan archipelago within the duration of only two centuries. It is the growth of this system that this study determines to underpin, as it will provide a more lucid explanation for a number of important puzzles that still confuse contemporary historians. First, the reason why and how the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu came into existence, the odd nature of Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political practices, and the secrets behind the mass production of titles as family and extended family gifts plus how these gifts determined the outcome of social, political, and religious activities that all three dynasties engaged in, in their tensely unavoidable coexistence especially in the eighteenth century. Chapter 3 - offers a general discussion of Ama&#8217;s possible schemes and plots. I argue in this part that Ama was determined to recapture and rule Safata. In Samoa I identify a connection between a political struggle (civil war) that took place in Upolu around 1500 &#8211; 1520 AD with the creation of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu in Tonga about 1550 AD. This war is discussed here for two reasons. First, it was an attempt by Samoan high chiefs to create a centralised in Upolu state to be headed by a Samoan monarch for the first time in their history. Second, the end result of this war affected Tonga more than Samoa since the vanquished Ama fled from his district Safata to Tonga. This chapter concentrates on discussing the major players in the said war. Chapter 4 &#8211; This part discusses Samoan politics at the time of Ama&#8217;s exile. I also unfold here the structure of Samoan polity by discussing the matai system and how it generates political, social and religious responsibilities among Samoan lives in general. This chapter discusses significant principles of Samoan social and political organisation such as matai (title system), tafa&#8217;i (royal protector), faleupolu (political advisors), &#8216;aiga (extended family), sa (family &#8211; royal lines), ali&#8217;i-pa&#8217;ia (sacred chief/district monarch), ali&#8217;i (high chief), tulafale-ali&#8217;i (minor chief), and tulafale (chief&#8217;s attendant). These organisations will be compared with the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political system so that the resemblance is not confused with the Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua systems. Chapter 5 - discusses with critical analyses the real characters of the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu political establishment. Such discussion includes TK status, the conception of &#8216;ulutolu (chief&#8217;s protector), hingoa &#8211; fakanofo (title system), falekanokupolu (political advisors), kainga (extended family), ha&#8217;a (titled chiefs related to an original royal line), &#8216;eiki lahi (paramount chief), eiki (high chief), &#8216;eiki si&#8217;i (minor chief), matapule (chief&#8217;s attendant). I argue in this part, that the TK political organisation is essentially structured in Samoan fashion both in theory and in practice and I will show the basic difference between this system and the quintessential Tu&#8217;i Tonga organisational principles described in the next chapter. Chapter 6 &#8211; This chapter depicts the basic structure of the Tu&#8217;i Tonga political organisation and how it countered the powerful hegemony of the TK expansion in the 17th and 18th centuries when there was an internal struggle for political supremacy among the three ruling dynasties. I discuss here counter hegemony by the Tu&#8217;i Tonga, which resulted in the creation of several new statuses such as the Tu&#8217;i Tonga fefine (female Tu&#8217;i Tonga), tamaha (sacred being &#8211; female), falefisi (sacred house of Fiji). This chapter also highlights the collision between the old political system and the new and also shows how the new system paved its way to an undisputed status in the mid 19th century after the last conflict of 1852. I discuss the new Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu ha&#8217;a system and the kind of impact it propagated in the dominions of Tu&#8217;i Tonga and Tu&#8217;i Ha&#8217;atakalaua. Chapter 7 &#8211; My main concern in this chapter rests on a case where a highborn female Tupou moheofo successfully usurped the Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu title and became the first female titleholder in this dynasty. She was very ambitious and pried into politics on a number of occasions when she made attempts to revolutionise the norm of Tongan tradition such as her well known move to dethrone her husband Tu&#8217;i Tonga Pau in favour of their son Fuanunuiava and also her desperate instigation to abolish the office of the TK in the 1770s. Chapter 8 &#8211; Discusses how TT Fuanunuiava aspired to obtain political authority and his strange ambition to be named Tu&#8217;i Kanokupolu after the death of TK Mumui in 1798. Why should a Tu&#8217;i Tonga vie to be named TK will be discussed here in great detail.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of culture as a protective mechanism against gender based violence: a case study in Mt Bosavi, Papua New Guinea : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy (Development Studies), Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dogimab, Mirriam Adang</field><field name="description">Development literature has not accorded sufficient attention to culture as a positive aspect of development until recently.

However, in the case of Papua New Guinea (PNG) culture has always been the focus in regards to genderbased violence, portrayed as the cause of violence against women. Occasionally sources state there are traditional customs or beliefs that protect women from violence, but further explanation is not provided. Hence, this research investigated the question, &#8220;How can culture address gender-based violence in contemporary, rural Papua New Guinea?&#8221; This study offers an opportunity to view PNG culture as a solution to a problem, instead of as merely a problem to be solved. To investigate how culture can be used positively as a strategy to address genderbased violence, a case study was conducted among the Sulamesi people of Mt Bosavi in the Southern highlands province of PNG. This research was conducted in a rural area because in general Papua New Guineans perceive people living in the villages as the ones living a traditional lifestyle, where established cultural norms and behaviours prevail. Using a qualitative research approach, the research investigated whether there were any traditional protective mechanisms in PNG used to address gender-based violence. This thesis concludes that through the identification of culture-driven protective mechanisms, it can be demonstrated that culture can be used as a strategy to address gender based violence. However, caution must be applied, since not all the protective mechanisms identified are desirable or constructive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural influences</field><field name="subject">Sulamesi people</field><field name="subject">cultural norms</field><field name="subject">cultural behaviours</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detecting cosmological reionization on large scales through the 21 cm HI line</field><field name="creator">Chippendale, Aaron Paul</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early universe</field><field name="subject">cosmology: observations</field><field name="subject">radio lines: general</field><field name="subject">galaxies: intergalactic medium</field><field name="subject">techniques: spectroscopic</field><field name="subject">instrumentation: spectrographs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aiding Aid: A monitoring &amp; evaluation framework to enhance international aid effectiveness</field><field name="creator" /><field name="description">This thesis aims to provide a coherent theoretical framework to guide the development of monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) information systems within international aid agencies. The thesis applies soft systems methodologies (SSM) to explore the research question and to develop conceptual models. The theoretical basis for the M&amp;E framework proposed is drawn from a transdisciplinary review of three academic fields: information systems,organisational effectiveness and project management. It is argued that inadequacies in the operationalisation of M&amp;E systems arise from divergent epistemological and ontological assumptions about the nature of information and its role within organisations that are concerned with effecting social change. The M&amp;E framework proposed seeks to resolve the dilemma posed by these divergent assumptions. This involves a M&amp;E information system (i.e.  MEIS) that is novel in terms of its scope, purpose and application. Firstly, the scope of the proposed MEIS takes in the entire aid organisation, going beyond the dominant, conventional approach, which is project-centric.  This enables alignment of project strategies with organisational mission. Further, it aims to promote the institutionalisation of lessons learned within projects (conceived as 'social experiments') for organisational learning, thereby enabling informed debate about the effectiveness of the organisation in fostering sustainable development. Secondly, the purpose of the proposed MEIS has been defined as being concerned with promoting organisational success. The critical success factors of learning and accountability are identified, and the role of M&amp;E in encouraging responsive management decision-making and critical inquiry and reflection is described. Thirdly, the application of the proposed MEIS involves a modified logframe.  The '3D-Logframe' serves as a conceptual basis to address limitations found with the conventional two-dimensional logframe matrix when employed for M&amp;E purposes. The proposed M&amp;E framework was developed out of iterations of action in the field and reflection. Further research will involve applying the framework in its entirety.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developing countries.</field><field name="subject">Humanitarian assistance.</field><field name="subject">Nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="subject">Economic assistance.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Business orientated resource diversification in smaller social service nonprofits: why some are adopting and others are not.</field><field name="creator">Feeney, Melisah Carol</field><field name="description">One of the current key challenges for nonprofit social service organisations is how to diversify resource mobilisation practices in order to build sustainable organisations that can innovatively achieve social mission. Two approaches to resource mobilisation that are promoted within Australia are social enterprise and partnering with business. Both of these approaches involve a re-orientation toward business, either in management practices or through an enduring relationship. Despite an increased interest in business-focused resource mobilisation strategies there are few successful examples of social enterprise and partnering with business emerging across the nonprofit sector. There is also scant empirically based research to understand what it takes to adopt these practices, what the consequences of adoption might be and how governments, nonprofits and business stakeholders might support their emergence. This research aims to build an evidence base to provide greater understanding of these issues. The thesis analyses data from fourteen organisational case studies of nonprofit social service organisations located across Australia. Seven of these organisations were selected because they had adopted an enterprising form of resource mobilisation and had been recognised for their achievements in this area. The other seven organisations matched these adopters in terms of mission, location, size and stage of organisational development, though had less diversified resource streams and had not attempted or successfully managed to develop a social enterprise or business partnership. Case-orientated research and qualitative comparative analysis was used in order to achieve causal complexity and a 'configurational' view of the cases (Ragin 1999). The thesis details the conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for business-focused resource mobilisation .processes to be adopted. Organisational capacity and self-efficacy are critical conditions that open up resource innovation possibilities; there is a range of other sufficient conditions that work in combination with these. There are value and ideological challenges to be negotiated by nonprofit social service organisations as they are called upon, both internally and from without, to reinvent the means with which they achieving organisational sustainability. This tension creates the need for new thinking at the level of policy and practice - across all sectors - in order that these critical organisations that bear responsibility for the social good can successful organise within the contemporary context.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probiotic bacteria for hatchery production of Greenshell mussels, Perna canaliculus</field><field name="creator">Kesarcodi-Watson, Aditya</field><field name="description">The Greenshell&#8482; mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A knowledge-based strategic theory framework for knowledge management : knowledge creation and transfer in businesses.</field><field name="creator">Duncan, Glen William</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

Historical anecdotes indicate that long-tailed bat populations have declined. However, it is unknown if all populations have declined and if declines are historical or ongoing. Thus, the development and implementation of a national network of long-tailed bat monitoring sites is a priority of the Department of Conservation's Bat Recovery Plan. Potentially, information gained from a national monitoring programme would assist conservation managers to target resources towards those areas where bat populations are declining and provide baseline information to assist managers to gauge the impact of management techniques on bat populations. Of critical importance is that unless it can be demonstrated that long-tailed bat populations have declined and that, that decline is real, management will not be initiated. The aim of this research was to investigate aspects of the ecology of long-tailed bats that would influence the development of a monitoring programme. The distribution, roost selection, habitat use, and activity patterns of a long-tailed bat population that persisted in the Waitakere Ranges, Auckland, were investigated. A study of the Waitakere Ranges long-tailed bat population was significant because (1) the Waitakere Ranges is the northern most location at which long-tailed bats have been researched; (2) the study was the first to be conducted on a long-tailed bat population that persisted in kauri Agathis australis dominated forest remnants; (3) the long-tailed bat population in the Waitakere Ranges is the only known extant population in close proximity to a major urban area; and (4) the factors that are attributed to long-tailed bat population declines (i.e., forest clearance, predation and urbanisation; O'Donnell, 2000) are likely to be ongoing and intensified in the Waitakere Ranges. Twenty roosts were located. Most roosts (85%) were in kauri, 2 were in mature rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum) and 1 was in a kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides). All roosts were in large, live, emergent trees. Mean height of roost trees was 38.4 &#177; 1.3 m and average DBH was 186 &#177; 12 cm. The entrances of six roost cavities were identified all were located in minor lateral branches in the crown of the tree and were primarily near the tip of branches. Roosts were a mean height of 24.6 &#177; 3.7 m above ground level. It was argued that roosts in the crowns of kauri were inaccessible to terrestrial mammalian predators. Twenty-eight roost watches were conducted. The average number of bats counted leaving roosts was 10.0 &#177; 1.5 (maximum = 24). Roosts were occupied by radio-tagged bats for an average of 2.0 &#177; 0.4 days, and 11 (55 %) were occupied for only one day. Roost size was the lowest reported for long-tailed bats. Roost switching also appeared higher than in other populations that have been studied. It was argued that morepork predation may have a significant impact on the population viability of the population. As in other studies long-tailed bats were found to forage over modified habitats including over farmland, dwellings, orchards and along streams and roads with little vehicular traffic. Long-tailed bats foraged throughout the Waitakere Ranges and their foothills. Bat activity was highly variable. Of the environmental variables analysed, temperature was found to have the greatest influence on bat activity. There were seasonal and habitat influences on bat activity. The relationship between sample sizes, variation in bat detection rates and desired statistical power using automatic bat detectors to monitor populations of bats was explored. A power analysis on activity data collected with automatic bat detectors indicated that declines in bat populations would need to be reflected in declines of greater than fifty percent in bat activity before monitoring programmes would have sufficient power to detect declines in activity. It was recommended that monitoring programmes should concentrate on intensive presence &#8211; absence surveys rather than long-term studies at a few sites.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">long-tailed bats</field><field name="subject">Chalinolobus tuberculatus</field><field name="subject">Waitakere Ranges</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">long-tailed bat populations</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">Agathis australis</field><field name="subject">kauri</field><field name="subject">habitat management</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270708 Conservation and biodiversity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/1682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Padre della nazione italiana' : Dante Alighieri and the construction of the Italian nation, 1800-1945</field><field name="creator">Finn, Sarah</field><field name="description">Dante Alighieri is, undoubtedly, an enduring feature of the cultural memory of generations of Italians. His influence is such that the mere mention of a &#145;dark wood&#146; or &#145;life&#146;s journey&#146; recalls the poet and his most celebrated work, the Divina Commedia. This study, however, seeks to examine the construction of the medieval Florentine poet, exemplified by the above assertion, as a potent symbol of the Italian nation. From the creation of the idea of the Italian nation during the Risorgimento, to the Liberal ruling elite&#146;s efforts after 1861 to legitimise the new Italian nation state, and more importantly to &#145;make Italians&#146;, to the rise of a more imperialist conception of nationalism in the early twentieth century and its most extreme expression under the Fascist regime, Dante was made to play a significant role in defining, justifying and glorifying the Italian nation. Such an exploration of the utilisation of Dante in the construction of Italian national identity during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries aids considerably in an understanding of the conceptualisation of the Italian nation, of the issues engendered by the establishment of the Italian nation state, and the evolution of these processes throughout the period in question. The various images of Dante revealed by this investigation of his instrumentalisation in the Italian process of nation-building bear only a fleeting resemblance to what is known of the poet in his medieval reality. Dante was born in 1265 to a family of modest means and standing in Florence, at that time the economic centre of Europe, and one of the most important cities of the Italian peninsula. His writings disclosed, however, that he was little impressed by his city&#146;s prestige and wealth, being instead greatly disturbed by its political discord and instability, of which he became an unfortunate victim. The violent partisan conflict in Florence and the turbulent political condition of the Italian peninsula in the late thirteenth century had a decisive influence on Dante&#146;s life and literary endeavours.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dante Alighieri, -- 1265-1321</field><field name="subject">Dante Alighieri, -- 1265-1321 -- Influence</field><field name="subject">Dante Alighieri, -- 1265-1321 -- Political and social views</field><field name="subject">Risorgimento</field><field name="subject">Italy -- Politics and government -- 1870-1914</field><field name="subject">Italy -- Politics and government -- 1914-1945</field><field name="subject">Fascism -- Italy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Italy -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Italy -- History -- 19th century</field><field name="subject">Dante Alighieri</field><field name="subject">Italian national identity</field><field name="subject">Italian nation</field><field name="subject">Nineteenth century Italy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2010.0085</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage.

Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction.

In light of these issues, the combustion regime known as Moderate and Intense Low oxygen Dilution (MILD) combustion has the potential of offering increased efficiency whilst lowering pollutant emissions. Essentially, MILD combustion relies on the reuse of the exhaust gases from the combustion process to simultaneously dilute the oxygen concentration of the oxidant stream, and increase its temperature. The benefit of this technique is that it results in a vast reduction in emissions, especially oxides of nitrogen. In addition, the thermal efficiency of the combustion process is increased, reducing fuel demands, as well as producing a more uniform heating profile and subsequently better product quality for many applications. The recirculation of exhaust gas and heat has been utilised for applications in the past. MILD combustion aims to extend the advantages of heat recovery and exhaust gas recirculation beyond the boundaries that are otherwise possible using conventional techniques. The relatively new concept of MILD combustion is a major advancement to the previous technology, and many fundamental issues have not yet been resolved. In a furnace environment, the dilution and preheating of the reactants generate a unique &#8220;distributed&#8221; reaction zone. There is a need to better understand the structure of this combustion regime and the parameters which control it. To emulate MILD combustion conditions in a controlled experimental environment, a Jet in Hot Coflow (JHC) burner is used in this study. The MILD combustion regime is examined using laser diagnostic techniques. The two key flame intermediates hydroxyl radical (OH) and formaldehyde (H2CO), as well as temperature, are imaged simultaneously to reveal details relating to the reaction zone. Simultaneous imaging enables not only the spatial distribution of each scalar to be investigated, but also the combined effect of the interactions of the three measured scalars. The role of four key variables are investigated as part of this work, namely; the coflow oxygen (O2) level, the jet Reynolds number, fuel dilution and fuel type. Also considered is the effect of surrounding air entrainment into the hot and diluted coflow, which causes a deviation from MILD combustion conditions. The local oxygen (O2) concentration is a key parameter in the establishment of MILD combustion conditions. The effect of lowering the O2 level is to lead to reductions in the OH and temperature in the reaction zone, in effect leading to a less intense reaction. When comparatively high oxygen laden, cold surrounding air mixes with the hot and low O2 coflow, MILD combustion conditions no longer exist. In this case, the flame front can become locally extinguished and subsequent premixing with the high O2 concentrations can lead to increased reaction rates and hence higher temperatures. It is therefore essential that fresh air must be excluded from a MILD combustor to maintain the stable reaction which typifies MILD combustion. It is found that the flame structure is relatively insensitive to both the type of hydrocarbon fuel and the Reynolds number. Each of these parameters can lead to changes in some intermediate species, namely formaldehyde, yet the OH and temperature measurements show comparatively minor variation. Nevertheless, fuel type and Reynolds number, in the form of increased flow convolution, can lead to striking differences in the flame structure. One of the most prominent effects is noted with the dilution of the fuel with various diluents. Some of the flames visually appear lifted, whereas the measurements reveal the occurrence of pre-ignition reactions in the &#8220;lifted&#8221; region. The unique characteristics of the stabilisation for these particular cases has lead to the term transitional flames. The fundamental aspects discovered by this study shed new light on the reaction zone structure under MILD combustion conditions. By advancing understanding of MILD combustion, future combustion systems will be able to better utilise the efficiency increases and lower pollutant benefits it offers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en_US</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combustion; MILD; vitated flow; non-premixed flames; turbulent flames</field><field name="subject">Combustion.</field><field name="subject">Flames.</field><field name="subject">Fuel.</field><field name="subject">Combustion engineering.</field><field name="subject">Combustion -- Research.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/39466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wireless optimisation based on economic criteria.</field><field name="creator">Hew, Siew Lee</field><field name="description">The rapid growth in demand due to the emergence of mobile communication services with variable rates, coupled with the resource scarcity of mobile air interface, has encouraged researchers to find technological solutions to increase spectral efficiency in order to support different levels of Quality of Service (QoS). Radio resource management (RRM) plays a major role in QoS provisioning and congestion control for wireless networks. The main problem with the congestion control mechanisms provided by current RRM schemes is that they are mostly reactive, triggered only when congestion occurs. The common, traditional solution to congestion has been for system planners to over-engineer a network by assigning more resources than are necessary. This approach is very costly because busy periods are usually brief, causing the network to be often under-utilised outside of these periods. Current static, usage-based pricing models also fail to assist in traffic shaping to even out loads. Economic modelling offers a new perspective into current RRM schemes and enables efficient utilisation of scarce resources and congestion prevention based on concepts such as utility, price, Pareto optimality and game theory. Dynamic pricing has been proposed as a mechanism to encourage users to adapt their resource consumption level according to network conditions. A good pricing model can provide the necessary positive incentives to increase users&#8217; arrival rate when the network load is relatively low and negative incentives for users to defer their usage when the load is relatively high. In this dissertation, we propose an economic framework for pricing and RRM for 3G and beyond systems. Our aim is two-fold: to calculate an optimal integrated dynamic pricing and RRM policy; and to allocate scarce network resources in a fair and Pareto-optimal manner. The optimal integrated dynamic pricing and RRM policy is computed based on the stochastic distribution of users&#8217; budget, arrivals, handoffs and departures. Our results show that the integrated policy is superior in terms of average reward improvement and congestion prevention to current schemes that use static pricing models. In interferencebased networks such as WCDMA, we suggest users be charged according to their noise rise factor, i.e. an estimate of the amount of interference generated by the call. This interference-based pricing model improves on the conventional load-based model in by delivering higher revenue and lower call blocking and handoff probabilities. Using the axiomatic bargaining concepts from cooperative game theory, we derive a class of fair and Pareto-optimal bargaining solutions that allocate wireless resources based on users&#8217; minimum and maximum rate requirements. We propose two models: symmetric and asymmetric. In the latter, resource is allocated according to the price paid by the users. An important significance of the asymmetric bargaining model is that this solution is still Pareto-optimal and fair according to the users&#8217; bargaining power. Our approach is also a departure from current works using noncooperative game theory that can only achieve an inefficient outcome, i.e. the Nash equilibrium; or cooperative game theory that focus on only one solution on the Pareto-optimal boundary. By analysing a range of bargaining solutions instead of specific ones, operators can proceed to select the best outcome out of these Pareto-optimal solutions based on criteria like revenue.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">game theory; economic modelling; wireless communication; radio resource management; dynamic pricing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Penicillium radicum: studies on the mechanisms of growth promotion in wheat.</field><field name="creator">Anstis, Simon</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were to investigate the P solubilising activity of Penicillium radicum and identify other possible mechanisms of plant growth promotion that were not related to P solubilisation. The plant chosen for the studies was wheat, the largest cereal commodity produced by Australian agriculture. Given the large area that is planted annually to wheat, this crop represents a large potential market for P. radicum-based inoculants. However, it is unlikely that P. radicum will be effective in all wheat growing regions and all environmental conditions seen in these areas. Research on the modes of action may help to identify the conditions where P. radicum has a good chance of being effective. The P solubilising activity of P. radicum was assessed by examining the amount of P released from rock phosphate (RP) in-vitro. The effectiveness of P. radicum to solubilise RP was compared to that of another P solubilising fungus, the isolate P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1. Both fungi were cultured in a liquid medium that contained either NO&#8323;&#8315; or NH &#8324;&#8314; as the sole source of N. Changes in culture pH, soluble P and gluconic acid concentration were determined for both fungi in a 168 hour incubation in both buffered (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8) and non-buffered medium. For P. radicum, the maximum concentration of soluble P was 6.8 fold higher in the presence of NH&#8324;&#8314; compared to NO&#8323;&#8315;. In contrast, for P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 the highest concentration of soluble P measured in the fungal culture was not significantly affected by N-source. In buffered medium, P. radicum did not appear to solubilise RP and levels of soluble P were generally &lt;1 mg L&#8315;&#185;. In contrast, the RP solubilising activity of P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 was not affected by buffering. Increased RP solubilisation with NH&#8324;&#8314; as the N source and lack of RP solubilisation in buffered medium suggested that acidification was the main mechanism of P solubilisation by P. radicum. RP solubilisation by P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 was similar over the range of culture conditions tested and mechanisms of RP solubilisation are likely to be a combination of mechanisms that relate to both acidification and the production of organic anions. The effect of inoculation with P. radicum on plant growth and P nutrition was studied under glasshouse conditions using a sand culture assay that supplied defined sources of P. The plant growth and P response to P. radicum inoculation were determined in two separate experiments. In Experiment 1, plants were grown to pre-heading stage and supplied with either dibasic calcium phosphate (Ca-P), crystalline iron phosphate (Fe-P), rock phosphate (RP) or phytate (P&#8338;) as the source of P. In Experiment 2, plants were harvested after 8 weeks and supplied with either NO&#8323;&#8315; or NH&#8324;&#8314; as the sole source of N and the P sources were either Ca-P or RP. In Experiment 1, the plant P response (defined as higher shoot P concentration and P uptake) to inoculation was dependent on the P source. The greatest plant P response to inoculation was observed for Ca-P and no significant P response was measured in plants that were supplied with Fe-P, RP or P&#8338;. In pots that supplied Fe-P as the P source, there was an increase in shoot dry matter in response to P. radicum inoculation but this occurred without a concomitant plant P response. In Experiment 2, the plant P response to inoculation was dependent on the N source. In the presence of NH&#8324;&#8314;, P. radicum significantly increased the availability of P sources RP and Ca-P. While there was no significant plant P response under NO&#8323;&#8315; supply, there was a significant increase in dry matter production due to P. radicum inoculation. When the data of Experiments 1 &amp; 2 are taken together, results suggest that P. radicum possesses at least two mechanisms of plant growth promotion, (1) P solubilisation and (2) general growth promotion that is independent of P solubilisation. In agreement with P solubilisation in solution cultures, the P solubilisation mechanism of P. radicum in sand culture required NH&#8324;&#8314;. The ability of P. radicum to increase plant growth independently of a plant P response gave further evidence of general growth promoting abilities of the fungus. While sand culture is a useful tool to elucidate the fungal mechanisms of plant growth promotion, this approach cannot fully reflect the complexity of the rhizosphere in non-sterile soil. Hence, a subsequent experiment was done to determine the effect of P. radicum on plant growth and P nutrition in a number of field soils. The P solubilising activity of P. radicum was determined in four Australian field soils using isotopic dilution. Three soils were chosen on the basis of their chemistry of P retention: (1) Minnipa soil from South Australia was chosen due to P retention associated with the highly alkaline calcareous nature of this soil; (2) Innisfail Queensland, in this soil P retention was dominated by reaction with Fe oxides; and (3) Mt Schank South Australia, a volcanic soil where P retention was predominantly associated with Al oxides. The fourth soil, from Mingenew Western Australia, was chosen due to previous reports that P. radicum inoculation increased the yield of field grown wheat (Bio-Care Technology, unpublished data). The four field soils were each labelled with KH&#8322; &#179;&#178;PO&#8324;  and the specific activity (&#179;&#178;P) of the wheat seedling tissue was measured after four weeks growth. When the data was averaged across all four soil types, inoculation with P. radicum caused a significant 11.7% increase in the shoot dry weight of these seedlings. However, P. radicum did not cause any consistent significant difference in the specific activity (&#179;&#178;P) of plants when compared to uninoculated control plants. These results suggested that P. radicum did not have a strong ability to solubilise P from the test soils, and mechanisms other than P solubilisation were in operation to stimulate plant growth. The production of plant growth regulators (PGR) was considered as a mechanism of plant growth promotion not related to P solubilisation. To further explore the hypothesis that the production of PGR acts as a mechanism of plant growth promotion, the ability of P. radicum to produce the auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was investigated. Examination with thin-layer chromatography and the Avena coleoptile straight growth assay indicated that fractions of P. radicum culture medium with chemical characteristics similar to IAA (i.e. similar reaction to the Salkowski reagent and Rf as IAA) also possessed auxin-like activity. Using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) it was found that in liquid culture amended with the precursor tryptophan, P. radicum produced IAA at concentrations up to 0.406 &#181;M. These studies show that P. radicum can produce IAA under laboratory culture conditions. To determine the significance of IAA as a mechanism of plant growth promotion, further studies need to link effects on plant growth and development to the production of IAA by P. radicum. The ability of P. radicum to antagonise root pathogens and control root disease was considered as a further mechanism of growth promotion. Under in-vitro conditions, P. radicum produced hyphal growth patterns and enzymes (protease, &#946;-1,3- and &#946;-1,4-glucanase activity) that were indicative of hyperparasitism. Hyperparasitic growth was seen as hyphal coiling and branching of P. radicum against host hyphae of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium pseudograminearum and Pythium irregulare when these soilborne pathogens were studied in dual culture with P. radicum. The effect of P. radicum on the fungal root disease severity of take-all was studied using a seedling bioassay under glasshouse conditions. The ability of P. radicum to suppress take-all disease appeared to be related to the timing of P. radicum infection of wheat seedling roots and placement of the Ggt inoculum in relation to the roots. Compared to soils where Ggt inoculum was only distributed at distances &gt;1 cm below the seed, uniform mixing of the Ggt inoculum throughout the soil negated the beneficial effect of P. radicum on plant growth and its ability to reduce take-all root lesion size. Conversely, early infection of wheat roots by P. radicum gave wheat seedlings some protection against take-all disease. Where treatment with P. radicum was effective, increasing the inoculum dose significantly reduced take-all lesion size. While P. radicum exhibited antagonism towards F. pseudograminearum, Py. irregulare, Bipolaris sorokiniana and R. solani cereal root pathogens in-vitro, further studies under non-sterile soil conditions are needed to evaluate the potential for P. radicum to reduce root disease caused by these fungi. In conclusion, it is unlikely that one single mechanism explains the beneficial effect of P. radicum on wheat growth. In-vitro studies showed that P. radicum has a number of attributes that could function as mechanisms of plant growth promotion. These attributes were, (1) P solubilisation, (2) production of IAA and (3) the ability to antagonise soilborne pathogens in-vitro and reduce the lesion size of the take-all disease in a seedling bioassay. Sand culture assays revealed that at least two plant growth mechanisms were in operation, (1) P solubilisation and (2) a general growth promotion mechanism that was independent of P solubilisation. In agreement with Whitelaw et al. (1999), the P solubilisation mechanism of P. radicum operates via an acidification mechanism. The effectiveness of this mechanism may be limited by the availability of NH&#8324;&#8314; in the rhizosphere. Since NH&#8324;&#8314; appears to be required for P solubilisation there may exist an interaction between P. radicum and ammoniacal fertilisers. This will have implications for its effectiveness in the field. In-vitro studies suggest that the general mechanism of growth promotion may be related to the production of PGRs such as IAA. In this aspect the known colonisation of the interior of wheat roots by P. radicum would ensure that IAA produced by the fungus is taken up by the root cell and less subject to chemical degradation and/or degradation by other soil microorganisms. Further studies are required to identify the effect of IAA production on plant growth and the effect of P. radicum inoculation on root disease severity in non-sterile soil.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat Growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of turbulence structures on the air-side performance of compact tube-fin heat exchangers.</field><field name="creator">Allison, Colin Bidden</field><field name="description">Energy is an essential and critical commodity and our reliance on it has fuelled much of the debate and interest in society and academia alike. Environmental concerns, depleted energy resources and higher energy prices are the main factors that drive this interest. Energy efficiency is one of the main avenues to preserve and better utilize this valuable commodity. The energy exchange by employment of heat exchangers is extensive and tube-fin heat exchangers are widely used in industrial and commercial applications. Smarter designs could not only improve energy efficiency but may also save on material costs. Although mass production and improved manufacturing techniques have reduced manufacturing costs, tube fin heat exchangers have not evolved greatly to take advantage of these improvements. There has been a large range of fin surface enhancements proposed, such as waffled fins or louvres and while limited improvements in capacity have been achieved, this is generally accomplished at a much larger pressure drop penalty. Numerous studies have been performed in order to examine the potential of various surface enhancement geometries on an ad hoc basis. These presumably operate on the basis of enhanced convection due to increased turbulence levels. However very few of these studies examine the actual nature of turbulence that is responsible for convection enhancement. A series of experiments and numerical studies have been conducted to quantify the effect of the turbulence vortex characteristics on the air side heat convection of a tube-fin heat exchanger. Homogeneous, transverse and streamwise vortical structures were investigated. The thermal transfer performance resulting from these flows was compared to that of standard louver fin geometries by considering sensible heat transfer only, applicable to radiator applications. Several novel coils designed to achieve these vortex structures, were developed and their heat transfer characteristics were quantified. These coil designs can be described as the Tube Mesh, Tube Strut and a Delta-Winglet fin surface.The Tube Mesh heat exchanger consisted entirely of horizontal and vertical tubes arranged in an approximate homogeneous turbulence generating grid. While they had a lower heat transfer of between 53% to 63% of that of the louvre fin surface, they had an extremely low pressure drop of 25% to 33%. This has the potential to make them suitable for certain low pressure drop applications, especially if energy saving is a prerequisite. The range of Tube Strut coils consisted of a tube bundle with interconnecting heat conducting struts to form a parallel plate array were also investigated. Three different strut thicknesses and strut spacing were trialled. In general these had similar performance to the tube mesh at 45% to 65% the heat transfer capacity of the louver fin surface. The resulting pressure drop was 38% to 42% of that of the louver fin surface. A delta-winglet design which positioned the deltas in a flow up configuration just in front of the tubes was examined. It was found that this configuration had an almost comparable capacity of 87% to a louver surface having the same fin pitch. On the other hand it had approximately half the pressure drop of 54% of the similar louver fin surface. This particularly low pressure drop makes this design preferable from an energy utilisation perspective. While a slight increase in coil area is required, this is offset by an almost 50% reduction in operating costs by reducing the parasitic energy requirements of the convection fans. The experimental data gathered for this Delta-Winglet design served to validate a succession of numerical simulations which were performed to estimate the performance of other configurations of multiple vortex generators. In addition the performance of combining a delta-wing with a louvred surface was investigated. It was found that increasing the number of delta-winglets or combining deltas with a louvred surface provided little improvement in heat transfer but increased pressure drop substantially. The louvre design itself was examined, and simulations were undertaken to estimate the effect of louvre angle, as well as louvre pitch. A hitherto unexamined concept was to investigate the effect of having louvres with serrated edges. It was found that an increase in louver angle by 5 degrees had negligible effect on heat transfer but increased the pressure drop by 17%. A variation in louver pitch showed a minimal variation in both heat transfer and pressure drop. Surprisingly a serrated louver showed a slight reduction in both heat transfer and pressure drop but this was miniscule. It was established throughout the course of the investigations that the bulk of the coil heat transfer is performed by the first tube row. Therefore the potential for increasing heat transfer by shifting some heat exchange to the down stream rows was examined. This was attempted by having progressively increasing louvre angles from the front of the coil to the rear. While a slight increase in heat transfer performance was achieved, this accomplished at the expense of a 13%-14% increase in pressure drop. The outcomes have shown that substantial net improvement of heat exchanger energy efficiency can be achieved through optimization of the turbulence generation along the fins of a tube fin heat exchanger.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heat exchangers.</field><field name="subject">Turbulence.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of culture as a protective mechanism against gender based violence: a case study in Mt Bosavi, Papua New Guinea : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy (Development Studies), Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Dogimab, Mirriam Adang</field><field name="description">Development literature has not accorded sufficient attention to culture as a positive aspect of development until recently. Hence, in terms of using culture as a protective mechanism against gender-based violence, not much has been investigated or reported, since most studies on gender-based violence have focused more on cultural influences as the cause or effect of violence against women. However, in the case of Papua New Guinea (PNG) culture has always been the focus in regards to genderbased violence, portrayed as the cause of violence against women. Occasionally sources state there are traditional customs or beliefs that protect women from violence, but further explanation is not provided. Hence, this research investigated the question, &#8220;How can culture address gender-based violence in contemporary, rural Papua New Guinea?&#8221; This study offers an opportunity to view PNG culture as a solution to a problem, instead of as merely a problem to be solved. To investigate how culture can be used positively as a strategy to address genderbased violence, a case study was conducted among the Sulamesi people of Mt Bosavi in the Southern highlands province of PNG. This research was conducted in a rural area because in general Papua New Guineans perceive people living in the villages as the ones living a traditional lifestyle, where established cultural norms and behaviours prevail. Using a qualitative research approach, the research investigated whether there were any traditional protective mechanisms in PNG used to address gender-based violence. This thesis concludes that through the identification of culture-driven protective mechanisms, it can be demonstrated that culture can be used as a strategy to address gender based violence. However, caution must be applied, since not all the protective mechanisms identified are desirable or constructive.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cultural influences</field><field name="subject">Sulamesi people</field><field name="subject">cultural norms</field><field name="subject">cultural behaviours</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes. However, for the NZ Army OSB selection process the findings in the present study indicate that the Lie scale on the EPQ-R and the Vigor trait on the GPP-I may need to be interpreted with caution for Asian and Pasifika groups. These results are discussed in terms of implications for personality theory, measurement, and the direction of future research.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personality assessment</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised</field><field name="subject">EPQ-R</field><field name="subject">Gordon Personal Profile - Inventory</field><field name="subject">GPP-I</field><field name="subject">ethnic status</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380104 Personality, abilities and assessment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of translocation on kokako (Callaeas cinerea wilsoni) song and its application to management : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Van Herpt, Sarah Michelle</field><field name="description">This thesis fills a research gap in our knowledge of kokako song by looking at how song evolves in multi-dialect areas. Kokako only exist in small remnant populations separated by large tracts of unsuitable land. Kokako are very poor flyers, only able to fly for approximately 100 metres at a time. In order to prevent inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity in the remaining kokako populations, managers are carrying out translocations to establish new populations, maintain gene flow and prevent inbreeding. However, these translocations have the potential to be unsuccessful because kokako exhibit macrogeographic variation in their dialects, and tend not to breed with individuals who do not share the same dialect as them. If the purpose of the translocation is to enhance genetic diversity by having kokako from different areas breed then song is an important factor that must be dealt with. Song is extremely important to kokako for a number of reasons. Chiefly, it is hypothesised that song is their primary means of territory defence. A kokako gains all its resources from its territory, so it is imperative that they successfully defend it. Their duet song functions in territory defence, but also acts to form and maintain pair bonds. In order to try and address the problem that song causes in translocations I studied if and how song evolves in a multiple dialect area. I conducted research at Pukaha Mount Bruce, where there is a population of kokako originating from two different source populations, and thus two different dialects, Northern Mapara and Mangatutu. I looked at the Northern Mapara dialect, and recorded kokako belonging to three groups; kokako currently living in the source population, kokako that were translocated to Pukaha and kokako that were born at Pukaha. In order to determine how the song may be changing I looked at element repertoires, the levels of sharing between groups, the number of unique elements in repertoires and the syntactical and temporal characteristics of phrases. This study shows that translocation into multiple dialect areas can affect kokako song. Translocation did not affect the size of the kokako repertoire, but it seemed to affect the amount of sharing within and between different groups of kokako. Currently the level of sharing within the groups at Pukaha is lower than the level of sharing within the source Mapara population, indicating that the song may be diverging. There also seem to be more unique elements found at Pukaha, which in part explains the lack of sharing. There appears to be microgeographic variation at Pukaha, with birds clustered around the second (Mangatutu) dialect sharing less with the source population than do those kokako whose territories are lower down in the reserve. The phrases which are used are also evolving, with only one phrase truly shared among all groups. There are other phrases which show additions or deletions of elements, and so are evolving. The main change found in the phrases is the timing between elements, with six out of seven phrases examined showing changes. These results have repercussions for future kokako translocations, and the future of the Pukaha kokako. A low amount of phrase and element type sharing combined with changes of intra-phrase timing could lead to the Pukaha kokako&#8217;s inability to successfully defend their territories. This research shows how kokako song can give conservation managers information on the status of their populations in regards to interbreeding and raises questions which can be answered by further research, both at Pukaha and in other mixeddialect kokako populations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kokako</field><field name="subject">Callaeas cinerea wilsoni</field><field name="subject">Bird song</field><field name="subject">Conservation biology</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300802 Wildlife and habitat management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pain as embodied experience : a phenomenological study of clinically inflicted pain in adult patients : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Madjar, Irena</field><field name="description">This phenomenological study describes the lived experience of pain inflicted in the context of medically prescribed treatment, explores the meanings of such pain for patients who endured it and for nurses whose actions contributed to its generation, and presents a thematic description of the phenomenon of clinically inflicted pain. The study is informed by phenomenology, both in terms of its premises and orientation, and its research design and method. The participants in the study were 14 adult patients, admitted to hospital following burn injuries, or receiving intravenous chemotherapy upon diagnosis of cancer, and 20 nurses involved in their care. Data collection took place over a period of five months and included participant observation and compilation of field notes, and a total of 89 tape-recorded interviews (48 with patients and 41 with nurses). Through the process of hermeneutic interpretation a number of themes were identified and used to describe the phenomenon of clinically inflicted pain and the structure of the lived experience of the patients and nurses concerned. The phenomenon of clinically inflicted pain is described in terms of four related themes: 1) the hurt and painfulness of inflicted pain; 2) handing one's body over to others; 3) the expectation and experience of being wounded, and 4) restraining the body and the voice. These themes point to the embodied nature of pain experience and the extent to which the person is involved not only in the enduring of pain but also in its generation. The broader lifeworld of clinically inflicted pain involves patients in the experience of constituting such pain, often as punishment and almost always as something unavoidable, and in turn being constituted by their experiences in terms of losing and seeking to regain a sense of embodied self and of personal situation, and by changed experiences of lived space and lived time. Nurses who themselves helped to generate pain, frequently overlooked the patient's lived exerience and thus the essential nature of inflicted pain as painful, wounding, and demanding cooperation and composure from the patient. Instead, the pain frequently became invisible to nurses involved in its infliction, or when it could not be overlooked or ignored, it was perceived as inevitable, non-harmful, and even as beneficial to patients' recovery. The strategic responses that nurses adopted to pain infliction included detachment from the perceived impact and consequences of their own actions and objectification of the person in pain as a body-object on whom certain tasks had to be performed. An alternative to the strategy of detachment and objectification was involvement in a therapeutic partnership between the nurse and the patient, where shared control over pain infliction and relief helped to sustain trust in the relationship and preserve personal integrity of the patient and the nurse. The study points to dangers for both patients and nurses when clinically inflicted pain is ignored, overlooked, or treated with detachment. It also points a way toward nursing practice that is guided by thoughtfulness and sensitivity to patients' lived experience, and awareness of freedom and responsibility inherent in nursing actions, including those involved in inflicting and relieving pain. The study raises questions about nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and actions in relation to clinically inflicted pain, and highlights the need for nursing education and practice to consider the contribution of a phenomenological perspective to the understanding of human experience of pain, and the nursing role in its generation, prevention, and relief.</field><field name="date">1991</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pain endurance</field><field name="subject">Nurse-patient relations</field><field name="subject">Patient sensitivity</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1386</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The learning cultures of organisations : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Human Resource Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ramsey, Philip L.</field><field name="description">While there is significant interest in the area of learning organisations, research in this field has been fragmented. There is a need for an holistic model of learning organisations and a measurement system that can be used by both researchers and practitioners. This thesis applies Dilemma Theory as a means of meeting this need. An holistic model was developed based on a definition of learning organisations as ones that consciously seek to balance capacities with demands. In seeking this balance, an organisation will undertake a learning journey in which it encounters a variety of learning dilemmas: points where it must choose between alternative approaches to learning, each of which is attractive. In making these choices, learning-related values are established in the organisation. These values are the basis for a "learning culture" which shapes the way learning is understood and approached by the organisational community. Presenting people within an organisation with learning-related dilemmas allows learning cultures to be charted, thus providing the basis for a measurement system. Fifteen learning-related dilemmas were identified using three processes. Firstly, literature on learning organisations was reviewed to identify conflicts between metaphors used to explain the learning organisation. Secondly, a group of New Zealand consultants took part in a Delphi Technique process, in which they established criteria for identifying learning organisations and surfaced dilemmas embedded in the criteria. Finally, 'Culture Exploration Workshops' were conducted in three organisations to surface dilemmas experienced by business practitioners engaged in learning journeys. The 15 dilemmas identified were used to chart differences between 5 organisations. The measurement system was successful in identifying differences between organisations. Results were also consistent with values that might be expected from sub-cultures represented in the sample. The study concluded by outlining a programme of research aimed at refining the measurement system and applying it to the study of learning organisations.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational learning</field><field name="subject">Organisational culture</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of predictive maintenance to industry including Cepstrum analysis of a gearbox : a thesis submitted in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="creator">Aladesaye, Matthew</field><field name="description">The economic implications of equipment failure are called for effective maintenance techniques. The research investigates current maintenance practice in several New Zealand industries and the improvements that could be obtained by the use of predictive maintenance techniques. Initial research was undertaken in a series of case studies within New Zealand industries situated in Auckland. The first two cases studies were of preventative maintenance techniques of two conveyor lines in a biscuit manufacturing company. The results showed a well defined preventive maintenance schedules that was Systems Applications Products (SAP) programme was used to managed for daily, weekly, monthly and yearly maintenance activities. A third case study investigated current predictive maintenance technique involving Fast Fourier Transform analysis of shaft vibration to identify a bearing defect. The results diagnosed a machine with a ball bearing defect and recommendation was given to change the bearing immediately and install new one. The machine was opened up, a big dent was on one of the balls as predicted by the analysis and the bearing was changed. Research then looked at a novel technique called Cepstrum analysis that al lows the deconvolution of vibration spectra from separate sources. This allows identification of several defects from the monitoring of a single vibration signal . Experiments were carried out to generate transfer functions for different gear faults at two different loadings. Blind deconvolution of the signal using a homomorphic filter was used to separate the source forcing frequencies from the structure resonance effects of the two gear faults, indicating that the technique could be used successfully to monitor equipment for a range of gear faults occurring simultaneously.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Preventative maintenance</field><field name="subject">Machinery maintenance</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290502 Industrial engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the biology and reproductive characteristics of Pseudomugil signifer.</field><field name="creator">Howe, Effie Helena Irene</field><field name="description">The aims of this study were firstly to observe the breeding behaviour and embryo ology. and then to identify factors affecting the reproductive biology of the Australian native pseudomtlgilid Pseudomugil signifer (pacific blue-eye) and the impact upon it of the presence of the exotic species Gambusia holbrooki (eastern gambusia). Six species of the genus Pseudomugil, and the related Scaturiginichthys venneilipinnis, are found on the Australian continent. The normal breeding behaviour, egg surface morphology and embryology of four species of Pseudomugil (P. signijer, P. genrudae, P. tenellus and P. mellis) were first investigated, using aquarium and microscopic (light and S.E.M.) studies. The four species were divided into two groups: P. signifer and P. mellis; and P. tenellus and P. gertrudae. The study provided further evidence for the view that the embryology of the genus Pseudomugil differs markedly from that of members of the family Melanotaeniidae, with which the pseudomugilids have previously been grouped. The seasonal pattern of gonadal function in P. signifer, both in the field and in aquariums, was then investigated for populations of P. signifer from the Sydney region. It was found that P. signifer bred over the spring and summer months, commencing breeding as the temperature and daylength increased, and declining in breeding activity as daylength and temperature declined. There was no substantial difference in the pattern of reproductive activity between wild and captive stocks of P. signifer in the populations used. The impact of the presence of the introduced G. holbrooki on P. signifer was then examined, first in open-air tank experiments , and then in the field. In the tank experiments the exotic species profoundly affected the breeding of the native species. When G. holbrooki were in the tanks P. signifer did not gain weight or grow in total length (except for females given supplementary feed); ovarian weight and fecundity was greatly reduced and the ovaries were morphologically undeveloped. No eggs from P. signifer were observed in tanks which also housed G. holbrooki. G. holbrooki were observed to actively hunt and eat young P. signifer and to nip the caudal fins of adult P. signifer. The results indicate clearly, that at least in a captive situation, the presence of the exotic species has a very deleterious effect on breeding and hence possible survival, of a native population. A pilot study conducted at the same time as the harvest of the second tank study did not reveal such drastic consequences. However, even in the less confined field situation, some evidence of an interrelation between water quality, numbers of P. signifer and numbers of G. holbrooki were seen in one disturbed site (Home bush Bay). These findings suggest that a newly designed field experiment based on data collected from the power analysis of the pilot study could clarify whether G. holbrooki adversely affects P. signifer in the wild. The information gained from these studies can be used in the management of P. signifer in the wild, and serve as a model of the possible effects upon other native species.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pacific blue-eye.</field><field name="subject">Eastern gambusia.</field><field name="subject">Freshwater fishes.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/955</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential for phytoremediation of a metalliferous mine site at Mt.

In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by on-growing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative. Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the- ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102 CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch's postulates were confirmed for the two isolates. Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105 CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106 CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibrio sp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment. A bioassay was developed to screen and select bacterial strains as potential probiotics for GSM larvae. Sixty-nine isolates originating from a GSM hatchery environment were tested for probiotic activity in larval pathogen-challenge bioassays conducted in tissue culture dishes (TCDs). Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus were the tested pathogens. Forty of the tested isolates afforded larval survival significantly greater than pathogen controls (p &lt; 0.05). The bioassay technique achieved a 58% success rate in searching for putative probiotics and highlighted the benefit of including the host animal in the first stage of the screening procedure. The time of inoculation of putative probiotic strains prior to pathogen challenge influenced the outcome of the assay. A pre-exposure period of 20 hours revealed a greater number of potential probiotics than a two-hour pre-exposure period. Pilot challenge tests, under normal hatchery conditions, confirmed the usefulness of the TCD screening method in recognising effective probiotics. Following hatchery pilot trials, two probiotic strains were chosen for further study, namely strains 0444 and 0536. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and phylogenetic analysis identified the strains as Alteromonas macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536. Both probiotics were evaluated separately in a GSM hatchery facility during routine larval rearing and when the larvae were challenged with a high and low pathogenic dose of Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus. In all experiments, probiotic application significantly improved larval survival, if administered prior to pathogen exposure. Across all experiments, larvae that were exposed to the high and low dosages of pathogens averaged 14% and 36% survival respectively on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. If the probiotics were administered prior to pathogen challenge, larval survival averaged 50% and 66% respectively. Non-inoculated control larvae and larvae administered the probiotic alone demonstrated 67% and 79% survival respectively. In a repeat experiment, these benefits were reproduced, with the exception of A. macleodii 0444 trialled against V. splendidus. Neptunomonas sp. 0536 appeared to suppress naturally occurring vibrios in the culture environment of healthy GSM larvae. This was the first time A. macleodii and Neptunomonas sp. were demonstrated as probiotic bacteria. Many studies document probiotic application in aquaculture under conditions of pathogen attack, yet few describe the use of probiotics during routine production. The effects of administering the probiotic, A. macleodii 0444, during routine GSM larvae production, were compared against larvae from the same cohort that were not treated with the probiotic. The probiotic was administered daily for the first 11 days of the larval period and was provided at two concentrations, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1. Measures of larval swimming activity, gut colouration, lipid levels, larval survival, larval size and settlement success were recorded. There were minimal differences in all parameters between larvae provided the probiotic and control larvae. Probiotic treated larvae consumed more food and had higher lipid levels at the end of the larval period, but these were not statistically significant. All treatments completed the larval phase and settled successfully after metamorphosis. Survival at the end of the larval period was 37.2%, 38.8%, and 34.8% for control, 107 CFU ml-1 and 108 CFU ml-1 treatments respectively. The probiotic was still detected in larvae seven days after the final addition to the tanks. Animals were further grown in the field at a commercial farm. The probiotic was not detected in mussels at four months after leaving the hatchery. Combination use of the two probiotics, A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536, was investigated to determine whether additive protection against pathogen attack with Vibrio sp. DO1 and V. splendidus was afforded to GSM larvae. The effects of combination administration were compared with larvae administered each probiotic as single strains and non-inoculated larvae. Additionally, two concentrations were tested for each probiotic, both singly and in combination, 107 and 108 CFU ml-1. Larvae were administered probiotics daily for the first six days, challenged with pathogens on the third day and then reared until settlement (day 19). Although protection against pathogen attack was observed in combination treatments, when compared with single-strain administration, additive protection was not apparent. Administration of 108 CFU ml-1 levels of probiotics, both singly and in combination, afforded larval survival slightly better than 107 CFU ml-1 levels, although this was rarely statistically significant. On the other hand, the higher levels of probiotic led to smaller larvae and lower feed rates for the majority of the 19-day trial. At the end of the study, larval sizes were smaller in the treatment applied a combination of probiotics at 108 CFU ml-1 than those of the other treatments. Additionally, towards the end of the larval period, feed consumption in the combination 108 CFU ml-1 treatment was similar to that witnessed in the other probiotic treatments one day previously. This suggested that either the larvae were compromised or they were growing slower. Despite a lack of additive protection against a single strain pathogen attack being demonstrated, the potential benefit of multi-strain probiotics, as prophylactic measures against every-day microbial encounters in larviculture, would remain. Although 108 CFU ml-1 levels appeared to protect against pathogen attack slightly better, they were also potentially detrimental to normal larval rearing when administered in combination. Following the successful completion of the larval period and pathogen protection afforded with a combination of probiotics at 107 CFU ml-1, this level was recommended as the best concentration of each probiotic where combination administration would be applied. The work presented in this thesis supports the use of A. macleodii 0444 and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 in the routine rearing of GSM larvae. The ability to produce settled juvenile mussels, equal in numbers to those produced in normal healthy conditions, plus the benefits against pathogen attack led to the recommendation of their use on a routine prophylactic basis in GSM larval rearing. Their use for this purpose is intended in the near future. A provisional patent has been prepared and will be submitted shortly. It is anticipated that future work will continue with these probiotic strains to determine their potential benefit for other aquaculture species.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Greenshell mussels.</field><field name="subject">Probiotics.</field><field name="subject">Aquaculture.</field><field name="subject">New Zealand.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and the follow-through experience in three year Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. &#8216;Placements with women, not institutions&#8217;</field><field name="creator">Gray, Joanne Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Background This research explored the follow-through experience in three year, pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs in Australia. The follow-through experience involves midwifery students following women on their journey through pregnancy, labour and birth and into the early parenting period. The concept was introduced to midwifery education in Australia in 2001 when it was embedded in the foundational Australian College of Midwives. National Education Standards for Bachelor of Midwifery programs. The inclusion of the follow-through experience in Bachelor of Midwifery education programs was a deliberate strategy to ensure midwifery students would experience midwifery continuity of care. Aims The aims of this research were to: explore the follow-through experience in order to better understand its impact on students, midwifery education providers and midwives, and, to identify the learning that is associated with this experience. Setting This research was conducted in Australia. Students from all three-year pre-registration Bachelor of Midwifery programs were invited to participate. Design A qualitative study was undertaken. In-depth interviews were conducted with key stakeholders who had been involved in the development and implementation of the follow-through experience. Data were collected from former and current Bachelor of Midwifery students through an online survey and telephone interviews. A thematic analysis was undertaken and situated learning and constructivist theories were used to identify whether learning occurred in the context of the follow-through experience. Results The findings provided a unique insight into the follow-through experience from the perception of students and stakeholders. This research established that students do learn from their engagement in this experience. This learning was characterised by the primacy of the relationship with the women. Students also identified the challenges they faced in undertaking these experiences, including problems with recruitment and time commitment. Difficulties were identified around requirements of the follow-through experience, the lack of support at times for students, and the lack of congruence with the existing Australian maternity system. These difficulties were identified as having a significant impact on the students. ability to engage in, and to maximise their learning from, this experience. A conceptual model was developed to provide a synthesis of the results of this research and a framework for effective implementation and management of the follow-through experience. Implications This research has implications for midwifery education, particularly in Australia but also internationally. This experience does indeed provide unique learning opportunities for students. It is however essential that the student is given adequate support to aid their learning and to ensure they gain the most from these experiences. Conclusions The follow-through experience is an innovative education strategy and this research identified that learning occurred within this experience. This learning was identified as being situated in the context of students being placed with women. This research clearly identifies the value of the follow-through experience as an important component of student learning.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Midwifery students.</field><field name="subject">Midwifery education.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1081</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ZINC : perspectives of identity in Asian-Australian literature</field><field name="creator">Bakar, Michelle</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

ADR was incorporated into one of New Zealand's main environmental statutes, the Resource Management Act 1991(RMA). Under s.268 of the RMA the Environment Court (the Court) may, if the parties agree, conduct mediation in order to facilitate settlement of resource management disputes.  The RMA, which has now been in operation for ten years, gives no guidance as to the way in which mediation is to be conducted. The Court has developed procedures and processes for administering and conducting mediation. This study critically evaluates the practice of Court assisted mediation of environmental disputes under the RMA. A literature review and interviews with stakeholder groups are used in this evaluation. The study shows that mediation generates benefits for the Court and participants. It also identifies limitations with the current mediation procedures and processes. These may impact the effectiveness of participants in mediation, their satisfaction with, and support for, the mediated settlement and with the environmental outcomes.  The study recommends a series of guidelines be prepared on the functions and administrative procedures of the Court and on the mediation process promoted by the Court. Further research is also recommended. It is considered that these recommendations, if implemented, will enhance the process for participants, ensure more equitable and consistent environmental outcomes, in terms of present and future generations, and retain public confidence in the mediation process.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">environmental disputes</field><field name="subject">Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)</field><field name="subject">environmental mediation</field><field name="subject">Resource Management Act 1991</field><field name="subject">s.268</field><field name="subject">court assisted mediation</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">prerequisites</field><field name="subject">stakeholders</field><field name="subject">benefits</field><field name="subject">limitations</field><field name="subject">good practice guidelines</field><field name="subject">dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">180123 - Litigation, Adjudication and Dispute Resolution</field><field name="subject">050205 - Environmental Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living.

The plant chosen for the studies was wheat, the largest cereal commodity produced by Australian agriculture. Given the large area that is planted annually to wheat, this crop represents a large potential market for P. radicum-based inoculants. However, it is unlikely that P. radicum will be effective in all wheat growing regions and all environmental conditions seen in these areas. Research on the modes of action may help to identify the conditions where P. radicum has a good chance of being effective. The P solubilising activity of P. radicum was assessed by examining the amount of P released from rock phosphate (RP) in-vitro. The effectiveness of P. radicum to solubilise RP was compared to that of another P solubilising fungus, the isolate P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1. Both fungi were cultured in a liquid medium that contained either NO&#8323;&#8315; or NH &#8324;&#8314; as the sole source of N. Changes in culture pH, soluble P and gluconic acid concentration were determined for both fungi in a 168 hour incubation in both buffered (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.8) and non-buffered medium. For P. radicum, the maximum concentration of soluble P was 6.8 fold higher in the presence of NH&#8324;&#8314; compared to NO&#8323;&#8315;. In contrast, for P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 the highest concentration of soluble P measured in the fungal culture was not significantly affected by N-source. In buffered medium, P. radicum did not appear to solubilise RP and levels of soluble P were generally &lt;1 mg L&#8315;&#185;. In contrast, the RP solubilising activity of P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 was not affected by buffering. Increased RP solubilisation with NH&#8324;&#8314; as the N source and lack of RP solubilisation in buffered medium suggested that acidification was the main mechanism of P solubilisation by P. radicum. RP solubilisation by P. bilaiae RS7B-SD1 was similar over the range of culture conditions tested and mechanisms of RP solubilisation are likely to be a combination of mechanisms that relate to both acidification and the production of organic anions. The effect of inoculation with P. radicum on plant growth and P nutrition was studied under glasshouse conditions using a sand culture assay that supplied defined sources of P. The plant growth and P response to P. radicum inoculation were determined in two separate experiments. In Experiment 1, plants were grown to pre-heading stage and supplied with either dibasic calcium phosphate (Ca-P), crystalline iron phosphate (Fe-P), rock phosphate (RP) or phytate (P&#8338;) as the source of P. In Experiment 2, plants were harvested after 8 weeks and supplied with either NO&#8323;&#8315; or NH&#8324;&#8314; as the sole source of N and the P sources were either Ca-P or RP. In Experiment 1, the plant P response (defined as higher shoot P concentration and P uptake) to inoculation was dependent on the P source. The greatest plant P response to inoculation was observed for Ca-P and no significant P response was measured in plants that were supplied with Fe-P, RP or P&#8338;. In pots that supplied Fe-P as the P source, there was an increase in shoot dry matter in response to P. radicum inoculation but this occurred without a concomitant plant P response. In Experiment 2, the plant P response to inoculation was dependent on the N source. In the presence of NH&#8324;&#8314;, P. radicum significantly increased the availability of P sources RP and Ca-P. While there was no significant plant P response under NO&#8323;&#8315; supply, there was a significant increase in dry matter production due to P. radicum inoculation. When the data of Experiments 1 &amp; 2 are taken together, results suggest that P. radicum possesses at least two mechanisms of plant growth promotion, (1) P solubilisation and (2) general growth promotion that is independent of P solubilisation. In agreement with P solubilisation in solution cultures, the P solubilisation mechanism of P. radicum in sand culture required NH&#8324;&#8314;. The ability of P. radicum to increase plant growth independently of a plant P response gave further evidence of general growth promoting abilities of the fungus. While sand culture is a useful tool to elucidate the fungal mechanisms of plant growth promotion, this approach cannot fully reflect the complexity of the rhizosphere in non-sterile soil. Hence, a subsequent experiment was done to determine the effect of P. radicum on plant growth and P nutrition in a number of field soils. The P solubilising activity of P. radicum was determined in four Australian field soils using isotopic dilution. Three soils were chosen on the basis of their chemistry of P retention: (1) Minnipa soil from South Australia was chosen due to P retention associated with the highly alkaline calcareous nature of this soil; (2) Innisfail Queensland, in this soil P retention was dominated by reaction with Fe oxides; and (3) Mt Schank South Australia, a volcanic soil where P retention was predominantly associated with Al oxides. The fourth soil, from Mingenew Western Australia, was chosen due to previous reports that P. radicum inoculation increased the yield of field grown wheat (Bio-Care Technology, unpublished data). The four field soils were each labelled with KH&#8322; &#179;&#178;PO&#8324;  and the specific activity (&#179;&#178;P) of the wheat seedling tissue was measured after four weeks growth. When the data was averaged across all four soil types, inoculation with P. radicum caused a significant 11.7% increase in the shoot dry weight of these seedlings. However, P. radicum did not cause any consistent significant difference in the specific activity (&#179;&#178;P) of plants when compared to uninoculated control plants. These results suggested that P. radicum did not have a strong ability to solubilise P from the test soils, and mechanisms other than P solubilisation were in operation to stimulate plant growth. The production of plant growth regulators (PGR) was considered as a mechanism of plant growth promotion not related to P solubilisation. To further explore the hypothesis that the production of PGR acts as a mechanism of plant growth promotion, the ability of P. radicum to produce the auxin, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) was investigated. Examination with thin-layer chromatography and the Avena coleoptile straight growth assay indicated that fractions of P. radicum culture medium with chemical characteristics similar to IAA (i.e. similar reaction to the Salkowski reagent and Rf as IAA) also possessed auxin-like activity. Using competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) it was found that in liquid culture amended with the precursor tryptophan, P. radicum produced IAA at concentrations up to 0.406 &#181;M. These studies show that P. radicum can produce IAA under laboratory culture conditions. To determine the significance of IAA as a mechanism of plant growth promotion, further studies need to link effects on plant growth and development to the production of IAA by P. radicum. The ability of P. radicum to antagonise root pathogens and control root disease was considered as a further mechanism of growth promotion. Under in-vitro conditions, P. radicum produced hyphal growth patterns and enzymes (protease, &#946;-1,3- and &#946;-1,4-glucanase activity) that were indicative of hyperparasitism. Hyperparasitic growth was seen as hyphal coiling and branching of P. radicum against host hyphae of Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium pseudograminearum and Pythium irregulare when these soilborne pathogens were studied in dual culture with P. radicum. The effect of P. radicum on the fungal root disease severity of take-all was studied using a seedling bioassay under glasshouse conditions. The ability of P. radicum to suppress take-all disease appeared to be related to the timing of P. radicum infection of wheat seedling roots and placement of the Ggt inoculum in relation to the roots. Compared to soils where Ggt inoculum was only distributed at distances &gt;1 cm below the seed, uniform mixing of the Ggt inoculum throughout the soil negated the beneficial effect of P. radicum on plant growth and its ability to reduce take-all root lesion size. Conversely, early infection of wheat roots by P. radicum gave wheat seedlings some protection against take-all disease. Where treatment with P. radicum was effective, increasing the inoculum dose significantly reduced take-all lesion size. While P. radicum exhibited antagonism towards F. pseudograminearum, Py. irregulare, Bipolaris sorokiniana and R. solani cereal root pathogens in-vitro, further studies under non-sterile soil conditions are needed to evaluate the potential for P. radicum to reduce root disease caused by these fungi. In conclusion, it is unlikely that one single mechanism explains the beneficial effect of P. radicum on wheat growth. In-vitro studies showed that P. radicum has a number of attributes that could function as mechanisms of plant growth promotion. These attributes were, (1) P solubilisation, (2) production of IAA and (3) the ability to antagonise soilborne pathogens in-vitro and reduce the lesion size of the take-all disease in a seedling bioassay. Sand culture assays revealed that at least two plant growth mechanisms were in operation, (1) P solubilisation and (2) a general growth promotion mechanism that was independent of P solubilisation. In agreement with Whitelaw et al. (1999), the P solubilisation mechanism of P. radicum operates via an acidification mechanism. The effectiveness of this mechanism may be limited by the availability of NH&#8324;&#8314; in the rhizosphere. Since NH&#8324;&#8314; appears to be required for P solubilisation there may exist an interaction between P. radicum and ammoniacal fertilisers. This will have implications for its effectiveness in the field. In-vitro studies suggest that the general mechanism of growth promotion may be related to the production of PGRs such as IAA. In this aspect the known colonisation of the interior of wheat roots by P. radicum would ensure that IAA produced by the fungus is taken up by the root cell and less subject to chemical degradation and/or degradation by other soil microorganisms. Further studies are required to identify the effect of IAA production on plant growth and the effect of P. radicum inoculation on root disease severity in non-sterile soil.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wheat Growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/59078</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal : self-care processes among Thai people suffering from AIDS : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Siriwatanamethanon, Jirapa</field><field name="description">AIDS is a chronic disease that seriously affects health, emotions, social relations and household economy. People living with HIV/AIDS experience great suffering, stigmatisation and discrimination from other people around them because they know that it is incurable, contagious, evokes social disgust and is a complex disease requiring life-long self-care. This researcher explored ways people with HIV/AIDS take care of their health and manage their lives in the context of stigma and discrimination. A grounded theory study was conducted with 30 participants with HIV/AIDS, in Mahasarakham Province, Thailand. Participants were recruited from an HIV/AIDS day care clinic and by snowball sampling. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews, participant observations and field notes made during home visits. Interviews were tape recorded, then transcribed verbatim. &#8220;From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal&#8221; was generated inductively from the data as the basic social psychological process of Thai people living with HIV/AIDS. From experiencing social disgust to passing as normal comprised four categories: being HIV/AIDS, making choices, keeping well and feeling empowered. The category &#8220;being HIV/AIDS&#8221;- discovering the meaning of having HIV/AIDS, comprises four concepts: being diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, being stigmatised, suffering, and learning about HIV/AIDS. The category &#8220;making choices&#8221;- to live a normal life, involves three concepts: avoiding unhappy situations, getting remarried and seeking support. The category &#8220;keeping well&#8221;- maintaining emotional and physical health, includes eight concepts: religious practices, keeping a cheerful mind, self-treatment, taking care of the body, keeping the environment clean to prevent getting germs, healthy behaviours, getting healthcare services, and attention to, and concern about, medication. The last category &#8220;feeling empowered&#8221;- personal and social acceptance of illness, includes eight concepts: being encouraged, acknowledging the disease, social acceptance, tamjai, feeling proud of self, feeling good about life, feeling lucky and having hope. In the context of northeastern Thailand, successful management of HIV/AIDS was underpinned by participants making a transition from &#8220;experiencing social disgust&#8221; to &#8220;passing as normal&#8221; within their communities. The desire to live a normal life despite having HIV/AIDS motivated participants to undertake effective self-care in order to remain symptom free (thus avoiding visible signs of the disease), and to selectively disclose their illness to avoid the ongoing risk of stigma and discrimination. The findings of this study are useful in that they will provide Thai health professionals with a clearer conceptualisation of self-care among the Thai population. An inductively derived theory of self-care among Thai with HIV/AIDS can be applied and integrated by health professionals into the self-care models for people living with HIV/AIDS including models used in nursing education, research and practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">AIDS</field><field name="subject">Self-care</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Stigma</field><field name="subject">Discrimination</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321100 Nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/739</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling and analysis of hydrogen-based wind energy transmission and storage systems : HyLink system at Totara Valley : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Energy Management at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Sudol, Peter</field><field name="description">Distributed generation has the potential to reduce the supply-demand gap emerging in New Zealand&#8217;s electricity market. Thereby it can improve the overall network efficiency, harness renewable energy resources and reduce the need for upgrading of existing distribution lines. A typical New Zealand rural community consisting of three adjacent farms at Totara Valley near Woodville represents a demonstration site on distributed generation for Massey University and Industrial Research Limited. Local renewable energy resources are being used for the purpose of sustainable development. Alternative micro-scale technologies are being combined to achieve a valuable network support. This paper is an in-depth report on the implementation process of the HyLink system; a system which utilises hydrogen as an energy carrier to balance and transport the fluctuating wind power. The report documents its development from the laboratory stage to commissioning at Totara Valley, which was carried out under direction of Industrial Research Limited. The PEM electrolyser&#8217;s performance at different stack temperatures was investigated. It was found that hydrogen production increases at the same voltage with a higher stack temperature. This is due to the improved kinetics of the electrochemical reactions and decreased thermodynamic energy requirement for water electrolysis. The electrolyser efficiency measurement at the half of its maximal power input (247 W) resulted in 65.3%. Thereby the stack temperature attained less than half of the allowed limit of 80&#176;C. The capture of the excess heat by insulation can improve the electrolyser&#8217;s efficiency. Pressure tests were performed on the 2 km long pipeline at Totara Valley using hydrogen and natural gas in order to test their permeability. The results were compared with previous studies at Massey University and with data obtained from the industry. The hydrogen permeability was measured to be 5.5 * 10[to the power of]-16 mol m m[to the power of]-2 s[to the power of]-1 Pa[to the power of]-1 for a 2 km MDPE pipe. This is about half the result obtained from previous studies on hydrogen permeability through MDPE at Massey University which was undertaken at room temperature. The reason for this discrepancy is likely to be the lower ambient temperature during the measurement at Totara Valley, which can be supported with the Arrhenius equation. It was furthermore measured that the power loss due to hydrogen diffusion through the pipeline walls during the fuel cell operation is about 1.5 W at the current system operation mode. A techno-economic analysis of the system was undertaken applying the micro-power optimisation software HOMER as a simulation tool. Two operation modes of the system were investigated, the load following and the peak demand compensating. The simulation results reveal that the durability and the cost of the electrochemical energy conversion devices; electrolyser and fuel cell, are the main hurdles which need to be overcome on the path in introducing hydrogen based energy systems like HyLink. Finally, economic optimisation modelling of the small-scale system by best component alignment was performed. It was found that the electrolyser capacity down-rating of 80% in relation to the wind turbine capacity, leads to a minimal system levelised cost. In addition to this, the impact of various wind turbine/electrolyser subsystems and pipeline storage capacities on the fuel cell capacity factor and on the system levelised cost in the load following operation mode was analysed. The outcomes can be useful for further HyLink related energy system planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">energy carrier</field><field name="subject">fluctuating wind power</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering::290901 Electrical engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand common dolphin (Delphinus sp.) : identity, ecology and conservation : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Zoology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stockin, Karen A</field><field name="description">Common dolphins (genus Delphinus) are poorly understood within New Zealand waters. Prior to this study, most information relating to the taxonomy, population structure, diet and pollutant loads of this genus relied upon untested assumptions. Furthermore, factors affecting the occurrence, demographics and habitat use of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf remained unknown. This lack of empirical data has resulted in the inadequate recognition and management of New Zealand Delphinus. Inappropriately classified by the New Zealand Threat Classification System, the anthropogenic impacts that affect this genus have clearly been overlooked. The present study examines behaviour of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf and details analyses undertaken on tissue samples collected from around New Zealand. Results detailed here challenge many of the untested assumptions about this genus within New Zealand waters. The taxonomy of New Zealand common dolphins was assessed using 92 samples analysed for 577 base pairs (bps) of the mtDNA control region (D-loop). New Zealand samples were compared with 177 published sequences from eight other populations from around the world. New Zealand Delphinus exhibited a high genetic variability, sharing haplotypes with both short- (D. delphis) and long-beaked (D. capensis) populations. Indeed, the New Zealand population showed significant genetic differentiation when compared with most other populations world-wide. Furthermore, intrapopulation analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Hauraki Gulf individuals and other common dolphins sampled within New Zealand waters. Results suggest habitat choice and site fidelity may play a role in shaping the fragmented population structure of New Zealand Delphinus. Data relating to the occurrence and demographics of common dolphins in the Hauraki Gulf region were collected during boat-based surveys between February 2002 and January 2005. In total, 719 independent encounters, involving one to &gt; 300 common dolphins were recorded. Dolphin presence was significantly affected by month, latitude and depth. Group size varied significantly by month, season, depth, sea surface temperature (SST) and latitude, and was highly skewed towards smaller groups comprising fewer than 50 animals. Calves were observed throughout the year but were most prevalent in the austral summer months of December and January. Group composition was significantly affected by month, season, depth and SST. The yearround occurrence and social organisation of Delphinus in Hauraki Gulf waters suggest this region is an important nursery and potential calving area. The effects of diel, season, depth, sea surface temperature, and group size and composition on dolphin behaviour were investigated using activity budgets. Foraging and social were the most and least frequently observed behaviours, respectively. A correlation between group size and behaviour was evident, although behaviour did not vary with the composition of dolphin groups. Resting, milling and socialising animals were more frequently observed in smaller groups. Foraging behaviour was prevalent in both small and large groups, suggesting foraging plasticity exists within this population. Behaviour differed between single- and multi-species groups, with foraging more frequent in mixed-species aggregations, indicating the primary mechanism for association is likely prey-related. Stomach contents analysed for forty-two stranded and eleven commercially by-caught individuals collected from around North Island, New Zealand between 1997 and 2006, revealed arrow squid (Nototodarus spp.), jack mackerel (Trachurus spp.) and anchovy (Engraulis australis) as the most prevalent prey. Stranded individuals and dolphins bycaught within neritic waters fed on both neritic and oceanic prey. Moreover, a mixed prey composition was evident in the diet of common dolphins by-caught in oceanic waters, suggesting inshore/offshore movements of New Zealand Delphinus on a diel basis. Additionally, prey differences were also evident in the stomach contents of common dolphins sampled from within the Hauraki Gulf. Trace elements, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine (OC) pesticide levels were determined in five stranded and fourteen by-caught Delphinus sampled from around New Zealand between 1999 and 2005. Generally, levels of trace elements were low. However, concentrations of OC pesticides were similar in range to those previously reported for Hector&#8217;s (Cephalorhyncus hectori) and common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). Organochlorine pesticides dieldrin, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), o,p&#8217;-DDT and p,p&#8217;-DDE were present at the highest concentrations. Markov chain models were used to assess the impact of tourism activities on Delphinus within the Hauraki Gulf. Foraging and resting bouts were significantly disrupted by boat interactions. Both the duration of bouts and the time spent in these two behavioural states decreased during boat interactions. Additionally, foraging dolphins took significantly longer to return to their initial behavioural state in the presence of a tour boat. Impacts identified are similar to those previously reported for the common bottlenose dolphin, a coastal species typically considered to be more susceptible to cumulative anthropogenic impacts. Data presented here reveal the nature and apparent susceptibility of New Zealand common dolphins to human-induced impacts, namely fisheries by-catch, pollution and tourism. This in conjunction with taxonomic uncertainty, lack of abundance estimates and the year-round use of inshore waters for feeding, clearly warrants immediate attention from managers. Furthermore, the current threat classification of New Zealand Delphinus should be reconsidered in light of population uncertainties, and in view of the susceptibly to human-induced impacts revealed by the present study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dephinus</field><field name="subject">common dolphin</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">conservation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/790</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The tensions facing a board of trustee model within the cultural framework of kura kaupapa Maaori : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Social Policy at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Stokes, Kanewa</field><field name="description">This study originated from personal experience, as a member of a Board of Trustee (BOT) within Kura Kaupapa Maaori (KKM). The workload required for Kura compliance with government regulation and legislation, was phenomenal. The BOT model seemed to be structured on a corporate model of governance with accountability to the Ministry of Education. This contradicted with the needs of Kura whaanau to be involved in Kura decisionmaking. The BOT model unintentionally created a separation and tension between whaanau and BOT members. This research set out to explore the BOT model of governance within our Kura, from a cultural perspective, rather, than researching problems identified by ERa. The research undertook a review of the literature that placed the BOT model within the 1984 -1990 Economic Reforms. It highlighted the impact of past government policies, and administration, on the Maaori language and culture to illuminate the cultural, economic, political and social context of the establishment of Kura Kaupapa Maaori and the doctrine of Te Aho Matua (TAM). The BOT model, and KKM/TAM, are founded on differing values. The study was approached from a Kaupapa Maaori perspective; not wishing to reaffirm the negative stigma of past research undertaken of Maaori. The objectives of the study were to gain an understanding of whaanau cultural capacity, perceptions and understanding of KKM and TAM; and also, whaanau understanding of the BOT model. The research design consisted of a case study. This involved a questionnaire to all whaanau; and in-depth discussions with a sample of twelve whaanau. Appropriate ethical considerations were given to the process, which addressed both academic and cultural needs. Findings clearly identify the structure, and nature of the BOT model, being problematic within the cultural framework of a KKM underpinned by Te Aho Matua. The values and principles between the model and TAM fundamentally conflict. Findings also identify key factors, that both government and Kura whaanau can utilise, in advancing whaanau governance.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">kura kaupapa Maori</field><field name="subject">school administration</field><field name="subject">school boards</field><field name="subject">boards of trustees</field><field name="subject">ethnic schools</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/910</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of UHT-plant fouling by fresh, recombined and reconstituted whole milk : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Engineering</field><field name="creator">Srichantra, Arunee</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of preheat treatments on fouling by fresh whole milk (FWM), recombined whole milk (RCB) and reconstituted whole milk (Recon) in the high-temperature heater of indirect UHT plants. Various preheat treatments prior to evaporation during milk powder manufacture were applied to skim milk powder (SMP, 75 &#176;C 2 s, 85 &#176;C, 155 s and 95 &#176;C, 155 s) and whole milk powder (WMP, 95 &#176;C, 33 s). These preheat treatments were so-called &#8220;evaporator preheat treatments&#8221;. Skim milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP) were derived from the same original batch of pasteurised FWM to remove the effects of the variation in milk composition between different milk batches. These SMPs were recombined with anhydrous milk fat and water to prepare RCB, and WMPs were reconstituted with water to prepare Recon. Then, (homogenized) FWM, RCB and Recon were subjected to various preheat treatments (75 &#176;C, 11 s, 85 &#176;C, 147 s and 95 &#176;C, 147 s) prior to UHT processing. These preheat treatments were so-called &#8220;UHT preheat treatments&#8221;. Temperature difference (hot water inlet temperature &#8211; milk outlet temperature) was taken as a measure of the extent of fouling in the high-temperature heater. The slope of the linear regression of temperature difference versus time (for two hours of UHT processing) was taken as fouling rate (&#176;C/h). Increasing both evaporator and UHT preheat treatments resulted in increasing fouling rate and total deposit weight for all three whole milk types for several milk batches. In the case of FWM, there was no reduction in fouling rate with increasing UHT preheat treatment whether FWM was homogenized then preheated, preheated then homogenized or not homogenized at all. These findings, which are wholly consistent and well replicated, are in apparent conflict with the results of most previous comparable studies. Possible reasons for this are explained. Further investigations of the effects of homogenization relating to the role of whey protein on the surface of the fat globules showed that whey protein associated with the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, RCB and Recon and that association increased with increasing heating process stage. The increasing association of whey protein with the milk fat globules membrane with increasing severity of heating process stage became faster when preheat treatment was more severe: the association of whey protein plateaued on intermediate temperature heating when the milks were preheated at 75&#176;C, 11 s and on preheating when the milks were preheated at 95&#176;C, 147 s. In the case of FWM, the thickness of the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, which increased with the severity of heating process stage, was greater than the thickness of the membrane in preheated then homogenized FWM. Preheating then homogenization resulted in the greater interfacial spreading of small molecules on the surface of fat globules, i.e. whey protein or small molecules from the disintegration of casein micelles during preheating. Possible basic mechanisms for UHT fouling in the high-temperature heater include: the reduction in the solubility of calcium phosphate and the deposition of protein as fat-bound protein and non-fat-bound protein. When non-fat-bound protein in milk plasma deposited, it could be a carrier for the deposition of mineral, such as, the precipitate of calcium phosphate in the casein micelles or the deposition of complexes between whey protein and casein micelles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">milk powder manufacture</field><field name="subject">evaporator pre-heat treatments</field><field name="subject">UHT processing</field><field name="subject">casein micelles</field><field name="subject">milk protein</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality assessment and ethnicity : a New Zealand study : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Psychology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand.

To date there has only been two published studies that have used New Zealand relevant ethnic groups when analysing whether personality measures used in pre-employment settings exhibit different mean scores. The present thesis performed a systematic evaluation on the impact of ethnicity on personality traits. The study examined the impact of ethnicity on NZ Army Officer applicant personality assessment scores measured by the EPQ-R and GPP-I. Four ethnic groups (NZ Europeans, M&#226;ori, Pasifika, and Asian) were analysed for mean trait score differences among ethnic groups, the stability of these differences across different personality inventories and models, the variance of personality traits, the impact of ethnicity on age and gender relationships with personality traits, and how these differences were related to employment selection outcomes. The analyses revealed that ethnicity did have some impact on mean personality assessment scores used in the study. However, these were mostly small differences among ethnic groups. In addition, most of these differences found on the EPQ-R and the GPP-I were not consistent across inventories and models. There were no significant variance differences found on personality traits among ethnic groups. While initial analysis suggested that ethnicity did not influence the relationship between age and gender on personality assessment, further examination suggested that the relationship between gender and personality was impacted on by ethnicity. There were reassuring results found for New Zealand psychologists and HR specialists, as only two of the twelve traits analysed showed moderate differences on traits that were related to selection outcomes.

Previous research has shown that digital reporting has increased, particularly in the last five years, and this usage is characterised by greater volumes of business and financial information over that traditionally provided in print-based mode (Smith, 2003). The new opportunities and benefits offered by digital reporting are matched by challenges and implications not only for the preparers and auditors but also for users. It is expected that in the near future, financial reporting will move entirely from the primarily print-based mode to digital-based mode as the primary information dissemination channel (Oyelere et aI., 2003; Fisher et aI., 2004). Research in the area of digital reporting has been conducted in the past decade. Within this research, a considerable number of issues have been raised. These issues relate to various parties, such as policy makers, preparers, auditors, system designers and users. While several research questions and hypotheses concerning these parties have been posed and investigated, most of the research questions and hypotheses have been formed from a preparers' perspective, leaving the examination of issues from a users' perspective largely unexplored. This study focuses on users. It examines the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance in relation to decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the digital reporting environment. It aims to extend the digital reporting literature. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on digital reporting environment in several ways. First, this study examines the effect of presentation formats on the quality of users' decision making. This study follows Kleinmuntz and Schkade (1993) who described 'decision quality' in the context of two cost-benefit dimensions in relation to decision makers' cognitive processes, namely decision accuracy and cognitive effort. Decision accuracy reflects the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate outcome while cognitive effort reflects the total cognitive expenditure incurred in completing a task. Second, this study examines users' perceptions of three digital presentation formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. This study compares subjects' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of the three presentation formats with their actual outcome. It also includes examining whether perceptions are an important factor in influencing preferred presentation format. Finally, this study examines whether digital presentation formats address the concern over functional fixation in the accounting context of 'recognition versus disclosure' in the reporting of financial information. This study used public accounting practitioners in New Zealand as participants. Sixty two subjects participated in the experiment, which involves an experiment exercise and a post experiment questionnaire. The results indicate that presentation formats impact on decision accuracy. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted using non-digital presentation formats such as tabular and graphical in the psychology and information systems literature (Stock and Watson, 1984; Dickson et aI., 1986; Iselin, 1988; DeSanctis and Jarvenpaa, 1989; Mackay and Villareal, 1987; Hard and Vanacek, 1991; Stone and Schkade, 1991; Anderson and Kaplan, 1992; Bricker and Nehmer, 1995; Ramarapu et aI., 1997; Frownfelter-Lohrke, 1998; Almer et aI., 2003). The results, however, indicate that presentation formats do not impact decision makers' cognitive effort. These findings suggest that preparers, standardsetters and regulatory bodies should recognise that presentation format impacts on users' decision making processes and select appropriate formats that lead to improvement in decision making. Additionally, the results indicate that users' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the reporting technologies are similar across the three presentation formats. The results also show that users' perceptions do not necessary correspond to actual performance. Users' perceptions are found to influence their preferred presentation format. The findings of this study provide useful insights on users' perceptions, performances and preferences of the digital presentation formats. Such results provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the importance of perceptions and the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance. This is particularly relevant since if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, then there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of presentation. Finally, the results show that of the four recognised stages of information processing (i.e. acquisition, evaluation, weighting and judging information), functional fixation is found to only exist at the judgment stage. However, the effect of presentation format is only significant at information evaluation stage. The results indicate that the interaction between presentation formats and placement of information does not affect decision makers' information processing. This suggests that presentation formats do not solve the concern about recognition versus disclosure (functional fixation) in information processing stages. These fmdings are not consistent with Hodge et al. (2004) but are consistent with Luft and Shields (2001) who suggest functional fixation could not be alleviated because the accounting itself would affect the allocation of people's attention. This study extends the literature on presentation format by examining the quality of decision making arising from the use of different presentation formats in a digital reporting environment. It provides evidence that users' perceptions of ease of use of a presentation format do not necessarily correspond to their actual performance (cognitive effort) once a particular task has been performed. This study also provides evidence that the acceptance of a technology is highly dependent on the perceptions of that technology. Therefore, limited knowledge and appreciation of the capabilities of a technology may have the undesired effect of deterring use of the technology although it may improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concentration of dairy flavours using pervaporation : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Overington, Amy Rachael</field><field name="description">The food industry could potentially benefit from using pervaporation, a membrane process, to concentrate flavours. This research aimed to investigate its application for concentrating flavours in dairy process streams. Pervaporation experiments were carried out at a range of operating conditions, using hydrophobic membranes. The feed mixtures were either aqueous model solutions of dairy flavour compounds (acids, esters and ketones), complex model mixtures containing flavour compounds plus non-volatile dairy components, or real dairy products. Flavour compound enrichment factors ranged from below one to above 30, with esters and ketones being concentrated more effectively than acids. Thus, the flavours could be partially fractionated based on their chemical structure. The permeation of acids was reduced by approximately 50% when the feed pH was increased to near their p Ka values. For flavour compounds with lower molecular weights than approximately 1 20 g mol- I , permeation was controlled mainly by sorption i n the membrane; for larger compounds it was controlled mainly by diffusion through the membrane. The mass transfer of each flavour compound increased with temperature, following an Arrhenius-like relationship. The activation energy was a function of each compound's heat of sorption, its molecular weight, and the elastic modulus of the membrane. The activation energy was also related to the Arrhenius preexponential factor. Thus, fluxes could be estimated through empirical correlations. The non-volatile feed composition was an important factor influencing the pervaporation performance. Milk protein isolate (4% w/v) or lactose (6% or 1 2% w/v) bound with the flavour compounds in the feed, thus lowering the enrichment of sorption-controlled compounds. Milk fat (up to 38% w/v, in the form of cream ) reduced the enrichment of all the flavour compounds tested. Esters and ketones became unavailable for pervaporation as they partitioned into the fat phase; acids remained mainly in the aqueous phase, but their permeation was reduced because the added cream increased the feed pH. Experiments with real dairy products showed that pervaporation could be used to concentrate diacetylin starter distillate, and to selectively recover short-chain esters from ester cream. Of these two products, starter distillate is the more promising for use as a pervaporation feed stream.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dairy processing</field><field name="subject">Dairy products</field><field name="subject">Flavour enrichment</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1389</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internationalization in the face of export barriers : a study of New Zealand's firms : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the Doctor of Philosophy at Massey University, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jaeger, Sabina Josefa Elisabeth</field><field name="description">Export barriers have inhibiting effects on export performance, especially for smaller and resource-poor firms. Classical internationalization theory suggests that the bigger, the older, the more resource rich and resourceful a firm is, the better the chances for success of their international or global operations. In practice, however, many small New Zealand firms have been able to overcome export barriers and achieve successful internationalization quickly in the complex, turbulent, global environment of today. Existing theories do not fully explain how and why this is possible. The apparent knowledge gap is closed by the present research with its indepth investigation into the management of export barriers and related internationalization practices using a holistic approach based on case studies. In this way the study contributes to knowledge by advancing the understanding of internationalization behaviour. In conclusion a new theoretical model is developed from the variables which this research has identified as to influence export performance and internationalization behaviour. The research is based on the cases of fifty export firms across the major business sectors from New Zealand' s Manawatu region. The study design involved a postal survey, background research, in-depth interviews and observations. The triangulated data was compiled into case studies and analysed using Eisenhardt' s grounded approach. Two main categories of export barriers were identified: ( 1 ) industry or product-specific barriers, and (2) common or shared barriers independent of industries and products. The research design enabled research into management patterns independent from sectors or industries. The findings suggest that export barriers determine strategies. In a situation of severe resource constraints, large geographic distance from international markets and small domestic market size, New Zealand' s exporters anticipate their export barriers in order not to let them impact on export performance. Successful firms reduce the influence of obstacles towards internationalization by building their strategies creatively around their core competencies in what is described as a "bricolage" approach.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exports</field><field name="subject">International business enterprises</field><field name="subject">Small business</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1390</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of willow (Salix spp.) browse upon ewe reproduction and rumen microbiology under drought feeding conditions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Animal Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pitta, Dipti Wilhelmina</field><field name="description">A series of grazing experiments were conducted in the summer/autumn of 2003 and 2004 at Massey University's Riverside dryland farm near Masterton in Wairarapa on the East Coast of NZ, to study the effects of grazing willow fodder blocks (6,000 stems/ha) upon the production and reproductive performance of ewes relative to ewes grazing drought pastures. Drought pastures were simulated in this study and included short drought pasture and long drought pasture. Pasture with a low pre-grazing mass of approximately 1500 kg OM/ha, a dead matter content of &gt;50 % and a sward height of 5-7 cm was defined as short drought pasture typical of drought conditions. Long drought pasture was similar to pasture growing in the willow fodder blocks, with a pre-grazing pasture mass of &gt;4000 kg OM/ha, a sward height of &gt; 30cm and a dead matter content of 30-60 % . Willow fodder blocks were established on low-lying wet, marshy areas of the farm that had very low or zero productivity in the undeveloped state. Pasture development in the fodder blocks was noticed with the growth of unsown grasses and legumes, as the areas dried up following the planting of willow stakes, due to evapotranspiration from the trees. Forage in the willow fodder blocks included both trees and pasture that was grown under the trees. The nutritive value of short drought pasture was low with an ME of 8 MJ/kg O M ; long drought pasture ranged between 8- 1 0 MJ ME/kg DM; willow pasture contained 8 MJ M Elkg DM in 2003 and 1 0 MJ ME/kg OM in 2004. The nutritive value of edible willow tree (&lt;5 mm diameter) was superior to drought pasture with an ME of &gt; 10 MJ/kg OM. The concentrations of the secondary compounds such as condensed tannins (CT ; 30- 40 glkg OM) and phenolicglycosides ( PG ; 1 5-35 g/kg DM) were higher in willow trees compared to their concentrations (CT ; 2-3 g/kg DM) and (PG; 2-9 g/kg OM) in control drought pastures. Experiments involving short drought pasture, long drought pasture and willow fodder blocks as treatment groups were grazed by ewes for 10 weeks in regular breaks from mid February to early May. Ewes were mated during this period and were joined together after mating and grazed on normal pasture until weaning. Live weight (LW) change and body condition score (BCS) were recorded throughout the experiments, whilst reproductive performance of ewes was measured as the number of lambs recorded at ultrasound pregnancy scanning, lambing, docking and weaning. Measurements on wool production were also recorded at weaning. In 2003, experimental ewes grazed control drought pastures (short and long) and willow fodder blocks (restricted and full access) as treatment groups (n= 1 00 ewes/group; Chapter 2). Ewes grazing short drought pasture had an allowance of 0.8 k g DM/ewe/d whilst ewes with restricted access had an allowance of 0.8 kg DM/ewe/d from drought pasture and 0 .4 kg OM/ewe/d from willow fodder blocks. Ewes in full access treatment group had no access to pasture but were confined to willow fodder blocks at an allowance of 2.0 kg OM/ewe/d, which was the same allowance given to long drought pasture ewes. Ewes grazing short drought pasture lost weight at approximately 1 00g/d and recorded a low reproductive rate (90 lambs weaned/100 ewes mated) with a high proportion of single lamb births. Live weight loss was significantly reduced to 40 g/d in ewes grazing willow fodder blocks (full access) with a 20% units increase in reproductive rate due to more multiple births (P &lt;0. 05). Ewes grazing long drought pasture performed intermediate to ewes with full access to fodder blocks and ewes grazing short drought pasture, whilst ewes with restricted access performed similar to ewes grazing short drought pasture. In 2004 (Chapter 3), the restricted access to willow fodder blocks treatment was eliminated from the study and the number of ewes was increased to 165 ewes per treatment group. Performance of ewes grazing short drought pasture was similar to that of ewes grazing short drought pasture in 2003 , with ewes loosing live weight (40g/d) and a low reproductive rate (90 lambs weaned/l00 ewes mated) whilst ewes grazing long drought pasture gained L W (54 g/d) and had a higher reproductive rate (P&lt;0.05). Ewes grazing willow fodder blocks performed better than ewes grazing short drought pasture by maintaining L W and their reproductive rate was intermediate to ewes grazing short and long drought pasture. In 2005, a short grazing trial with rumen fistulated sheep was conducted to study the effect of supplementing willow to ewes grazing drought pastures upon plasma amino acid concentrations (Chapter 4) and upon the microbiology of the rumen (Chapter 5 and 6). Grazing occurred during summer/autumn for 10 weeks with two treatment groups; control (short drought pasture; n=7) at an allowance of 0.8 kg DM/ewe/d and ewes grazing short drought pasture at 0.8 kg DM/ewe/d plus a supplement of fresh willow at 1.4 kg fresh willow/ewe/d (n=7) . Blood samples for the quantification of plasma amino acids were collected at week 5 and 10, with L W and BCS measured at fortnightly intervals. Short drought pasture in this experiment had a low pasture mass (2000 k g DM/ha) and a low nutritive value (8 MJ/kg DM), whilst willow had a higher M E of 10 MJ/kg OM. Both groups of ewes lost live weight at the rate of 50 g/d. Plasma concentration of 3 methylhistidine (3-MTH; 88 vs 127&#956; mole/L) at week 5 and non essential amino acids (NEAA; 1082 vs 1417&#956; mo1e/L) at week 5 and ( 1155 vs 1324 &#956; mole/L) at week 10, were substantially lower (P&lt;0 .05) in w illow supplemented ewes than control ewes. It was concluded that the increased reproductive rate from willow supplementation in ewes grazing drought pasture might be partly explained by reduced body protein catabolism, besides also increasing plasma branched chain amino acids CBCAA) and essential amino acids (EAA) concentrations. To investigate the effects of willow supplementation on rumen microbes, rumen samples were collected during the 2005 experiment with fistulated ewes over a 10 week period. The study involved the use of a molecular technique ( Chapter 5), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), to compare the rumen microbial populations between the control and supplemented ewes and a cultivation technique (Chapter 6) to study the effect on rumen bacteria of ewes grazing drought pastures with and with out willow supplementation. DGGE analysis of the V3 region of 16S ribosomal RNA genes in DNA extracted from samples of rumen contents taken fortnightly over a 10 week feeding period showed a distinct difference in banding patterns between treatment groups which progressively developed over time, showing rumen microbial adaptation to willow supplementation. However, phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequences retrieved from the DGGE bands from willow-supplemented and control ewes did not cluster by treatment group. It was deduced that willow supplementation induced a change in rumen bacterial populations through selecting sub-populations of organisms already present in the rumen. The changes in the rumen bacterial populations is attributed to the ability of these bacteria to metabolise secondary compounds in willow such as phenolicglycosides and flavanoid monomers and their ability to resist the inhibitory effects of condensed tannins. The cultivation study involved enumeration, isolation and purification of bacterial colonies on Complete Carbohydrate, Salicin, Xylan, Cellulose and Willow media followed by full characterisation of a representative set of pure bacterial cultures. Total bacterial counts on the above media at week 5 and week 10 were generally lower in willow-supplemented ewes compared to control ewes and the 16S rRNA gene sequences of the majority of iso lates characterised from both Salicin and Xylan media, were most closely related to species from the Pseudobutyrivibrio genus. Isolates from Willow medium clustered as two distinct groups. One group (mostly isolated from control ewes) was made up of mainly of organisms not usually associated with the rumen and probably represent non-resident organisms that are passing through the rumen. The other group of bacteria were mainly retrieved from willow-supplemented ewes and were most closely related to species of the Ofsenella genus. Compared to bacteria isolated on Salicin and Xylan media, isolates on Willow medium showed little ability to ferment various carbohydrates or trypticase (hydrolysed protein) but were able to utilise secondary compounds from willow. It was concluded that willow fodder blocks are useful sources of supplementary fodder for mating ewes during drought situations. Both the field and m icrobiological studies showed adaptation to the willow supplementary diet, including the detection of Olsenelfa-like bacteria for the first time in the rumen. It is suggested that the principal purpose of the rumen investigation is the degradation of secondary compounds present in willow.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheep fodder</field><field name="subject">Rumen analysis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300400 Animal Production</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterization and possible biocontrol application of Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) isolated from NZ sources : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Muftikhar</field><field name="description">Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) are unique, predatory, endoparasitic, Gram-negative bacteria. As the world's smallest living hunter they prey on other Gram-negative bacteria giving them potential as biological control agents. Prior to this study, however, there were no reports of BD in New Zealand. The overall aim of this research was to isolate BD from New Zealand sources, characterise them and investigate their potential role as a biological control agent. The history, characteristics, life cycle and mechanism of predation of this organism are reviewed and the possibility of the industrial applications of BD, are discussed. In this study, a halophilic species of BD was isolated from fourteen coastal sea water sites around New Zealand. Thirteen isolates were characterised using proven characterisation techniques including general, microscopic and molecular techniques. It was found that the isolates were taxonomically identical or very closely related to each other and belong to the genus Bacteriovorax. The predation pattern of BD isolates was examined against a group of Gram negative bacteria in solid and liquid media. The predation patterns and efficiencies of the different BD isolates were similar, which confirms that the BD isolates are closely related, are selective in their predation, and prey on some Gram-negative bacteria but not all. The rapid loss of culture viability of BD is well known, but no studies have been reported to date on the survival of pure cultures of BD at different temperatures. The survival rate of BD in dense suspensions at different temperatures without host bacteria was investigated and it was observed that pure BD cultures can be stored with minimal reduction in numbers at temperatures ranging from 4&#176;C to 20&#176;C. However, significant reductions in numbers were observed at -1 8"C, 30&#176;C and 37&#176;C after 13 to 16 days. The effects of the 13 New Zealand BD isolates on the growth of a population of Photobacterium phosphoreum were examined to select the best isolate for in vitro application. All of the isolates tested had considerable reduction effect against P. phosphoreum. Some isolates were more effective than others, despite their taxonomic similarity to each other. The isolate OT2 was selected for further studies based on these results. The in vitro efficacy of BD was assessed against late exponential cultures of a seafood spoilage bacterium, P. phosphoreum, originally isolated from Cod fillets from Denmark. Loglo reductions of P. phosphoreum and some other Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 4.5 to 4.8 after 9 h of incubation at 25OC. BD was effective in reducing the numbers of P. phosphoreum at pH 5.5 to 8.5 and salinity 0.9 to 4.5% (wlv). A significant interaction was observed between the prey and predator concentrations and nutrient concentration. Prey concentrations were observed to be the most vital factor in predation and the most favourable predation conditions were at a prey concentration of -8 loglo colony forming units (CFU)/mL, together with a predator concentration of 3 - 7 loglo plaque forming units (PFU)/mL and a prey : predator ratio of &gt;5.0. The thresholds of the prey and predator concentrations for predation were observed to be 3.7 loglo CFUImL and 3.9 loglo PFUImL, respectively. The trials carried out in this study focused on the efficiency of BD on a pure culture of one organism, P. phosphoreum and not on mixed cultures of Gramnegative spoilage bacteria, the normal condition observed in saltwater fish. There has been very little research in this field and the results of these trials suggest further investigation into the effect of BD on mixed cultures of Gram-negative spoilage organisms is warranted. Since only one isolate of BD (OT2) was examined against only one spoilage bacterium (P. phosphoreum) in liquid medium, the evidence of these findings must be restricted to these particular conditions. Future studies, using a range of BD isolates against a mixture of spoilage and pathogenic organisms in solid medium are warranted. The biopreservation capability of BD in extending the shelf life of king salmon was evaluated. A significant effect was observed at 20&#176;C but not at 10&#176;C. At 20&#176;C the shelf life was extended through extension of the lag phase of growth of the prey bacteria and a reduction in total numbers attained. Sensory evaluation of the salmon product being tested confirmed that the shelf life was extended. However, at 10&#176;C there was no reduction in prey organisms, which suggested that the strain of BD used is ineffective at refrigeration temperatures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</field><field name="subject">Photobacterium phosphoreum</field><field name="subject">Fishery products</field><field name="subject">Biocontrol</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses to psychological contract breach: moderating effects of organisational-embeddedness</field><field name="creator">Kiazad, Kohyar</field><field name="description">Although the negative effects of psychological contract breach (&#8220;breach&#8221;) are reasonably well established (e.g., Zhao, Wayne, Glibkowski, &amp; Bravo, 2007), the role of context in shaping employees&#8217; responses to breach has not been thoroughly explored (Lo &amp; Aryee, 2003).

The philosophical underpinnings of early development were based on economic theories. Over the years initiatives have manifested themselves by investments through international aid projects. As aid projects are donor-driven, most exit strategy planning involves closing down a project without turning it over to another organization to continue implementation. This means that aid benefits end with whatever impact the project has made, leaving ill-equipped local ministries or under-resourced NGOs to meet local development needs and fill the gap of terminated services. The project cycle&#8212;a popular development tool used by multinational and bilateral organizations alike&#8212;provides a framework to induce development, but makes no accommodation for an exit strategy that perpetuates development.  This is a missed opportunity that reveals a flaw in the project cycle. This flaw can be corrected by revising the project cycle implementation stage to include building the capacity of people to perform the functions the project was designed for, as well as a local implementing entity through which they can work.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of milk protein ingredients on physico-chemical properties of rice starch : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology at Massey University Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Noisuwan, Angkana</field><field name="description">The overall aim of this thesis is to determine if the interactions between normal and waxy rice starch and milk proteins from four milk protein ingredients, namely skim milk powder (SMP), milk protein concentrate (MPC), sodium caseinate (NaCAS) and whey protein isolate (WPI) do occur, and to identify the mechanisms underlying these interactions. Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of UHT-plant fouling by fresh, recombined and reconstituted whole milk : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Engineering</field><field name="creator">Srichantra, Arunee</field><field name="description">The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of preheat treatments on fouling by fresh whole milk (FWM), recombined whole milk (RCB) and reconstituted whole milk (Recon) in the high-temperature heater of indirect UHT plants.

Skim milk powder (SMP) and whole milk powder (WMP) were derived from the same original batch of pasteurised FWM to remove the effects of the variation in milk composition between different milk batches. These SMPs were recombined with anhydrous milk fat and water to prepare RCB, and WMPs were reconstituted with water to prepare Recon. Then, (homogenized) FWM, RCB and Recon were subjected to various preheat treatments (75 &#176;C, 11 s, 85 &#176;C, 147 s and 95 &#176;C, 147 s) prior to UHT processing. These preheat treatments were so-called &#8220;UHT preheat treatments&#8221;. Temperature difference (hot water inlet temperature &#8211; milk outlet temperature) was taken as a measure of the extent of fouling in the high-temperature heater. The slope of the linear regression of temperature difference versus time (for two hours of UHT processing) was taken as fouling rate (&#176;C/h). Increasing both evaporator and UHT preheat treatments resulted in increasing fouling rate and total deposit weight for all three whole milk types for several milk batches. In the case of FWM, there was no reduction in fouling rate with increasing UHT preheat treatment whether FWM was homogenized then preheated, preheated then homogenized or not homogenized at all. These findings, which are wholly consistent and well replicated, are in apparent conflict with the results of most previous comparable studies. Possible reasons for this are explained. Further investigations of the effects of homogenization relating to the role of whey protein on the surface of the fat globules showed that whey protein associated with the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, RCB and Recon and that association increased with increasing heating process stage. The increasing association of whey protein with the milk fat globules membrane with increasing severity of heating process stage became faster when preheat treatment was more severe: the association of whey protein plateaued on intermediate temperature heating when the milks were preheated at 75&#176;C, 11 s and on preheating when the milks were preheated at 95&#176;C, 147 s. In the case of FWM, the thickness of the membrane covering the surface of fat globules for homogenized then preheated FWM, which increased with the severity of heating process stage, was greater than the thickness of the membrane in preheated then homogenized FWM. Preheating then homogenization resulted in the greater interfacial spreading of small molecules on the surface of fat globules, i.e. whey protein or small molecules from the disintegration of casein micelles during preheating. Possible basic mechanisms for UHT fouling in the high-temperature heater include: the reduction in the solubility of calcium phosphate and the deposition of protein as fat-bound protein and non-fat-bound protein. When non-fat-bound protein in milk plasma deposited, it could be a carrier for the deposition of mineral, such as, the precipitate of calcium phosphate in the casein micelles or the deposition of complexes between whey protein and casein micelles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">milk powder manufacture</field><field name="subject">evaporator pre-heat treatments</field><field name="subject">UHT processing</field><field name="subject">casein micelles</field><field name="subject">milk protein</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/961</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Accelerating classifier training using AdaBoost within cascades of boosted ensembles : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Sciences at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Susnjak, Teo</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to address current problems encountered when training classifiers within the framework of cascades of boosted ensembles (CoBE). At present, a signifi- cant challenge facing this framework are inordinate classifier training runtimes. In some cases, it can take days or weeks (Viola and Jones, 2004; Verschae et al., 2008) to train a classifier. The protracted training runtimes are an obstacle to the wider use of this framework (Brubaker et al., 2006). They also hinder the process of producing effective object detection applications and make the testing of new theories and algorithms, as well as verifications of others research, a considerable challenge (McCane and Novins, 2003). An additional shortcoming of the CoBE framework is its limited ability to train clas- sifiers incrementally. Presently, the most reliable method of integrating new dataset in- formation into an existing classifier, is to re-train a classifier from beginning using the combined new and old datasets. This process is inefficient. It lacks scalability and dis- cards valuable information learned in previous training. To deal with these challenges, this thesis extends on the research by Barczak et al. (2008), and presents alternative CoBE frameworks for training classifiers. The alterna- tive frameworks reduce training runtimes by an order of magnitude over common CoBE frameworks and introduce additional tractability to the process. They achieve this, while preserving the generalization ability of their classifiers. This research also introduces a new framework for incrementally training CoBE clas- sifiers and shows how this can be done without re-training classifiers from beginning. However, the incremental framework for CoBEs has some limitations. Although it is able to improve the positive detection rates of existing classifiers, currently it is unable to lower their false detection rates.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CoBE framework</field><field name="subject">classifiers</field><field name="subject">classification algorithms</field><field name="subject">machine learning</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280212 Neural networks, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital reporting formats and users of financial reports : decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the context of recognition versus disclosure : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Accountancy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ghani, Erlane K.</field><field name="description">The evolvement of digital reporting has changed the way financial information is prepared and disseminated (Debreceny and Gray, 200 1 ). Previous research has shown that digital reporting has increased, particularly in the last five years, and this usage is characterised by greater volumes of business and financial information over that traditionally provided in print-based mode (Smith, 2003). The new opportunities and benefits offered by digital reporting are matched by challenges and implications not only for the preparers and auditors but also for users. It is expected that in the near future, financial reporting will move entirely from the primarily print-based mode to digital-based mode as the primary information dissemination channel (Oyelere et aI., 2003; Fisher et aI., 2004). Research in the area of digital reporting has been conducted in the past decade. Within this research, a considerable number of issues have been raised. These issues relate to various parties, such as policy makers, preparers, auditors, system designers and users. While several research questions and hypotheses concerning these parties have been posed and investigated, most of the research questions and hypotheses have been formed from a preparers' perspective, leaving the examination of issues from a users' perspective largely unexplored. This study focuses on users. It examines the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance in relation to decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the digital reporting environment. It aims to extend the digital reporting literature. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on digital reporting environment in several ways. First, this study examines the effect of presentation formats on the quality of users' decision making. This study follows Kleinmuntz and Schkade (1993) who described 'decision quality' in the context of two cost-benefit dimensions in relation to decision makers' cognitive processes, namely decision accuracy and cognitive effort. Decision accuracy reflects the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate outcome while cognitive effort reflects the total cognitive expenditure incurred in completing a task. Second, this study examines users' perceptions of three digital presentation formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. This study compares subjects' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of the three presentation formats with their actual outcome. It also includes examining whether perceptions are an important factor in influencing preferred presentation format. Finally, this study examines whether digital presentation formats address the concern over functional fixation in the accounting context of 'recognition versus disclosure' in the reporting of financial information. This study used public accounting practitioners in New Zealand as participants. Sixty two subjects participated in the experiment, which involves an experiment exercise and a post experiment questionnaire. The results indicate that presentation formats impact on decision accuracy. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted using non-digital presentation formats such as tabular and graphical in the psychology and information systems literature (Stock and Watson, 1984; Dickson et aI., 1986; Iselin, 1988; DeSanctis and Jarvenpaa, 1989; Mackay and Villareal, 1987; Hard and Vanacek, 1991; Stone and Schkade, 1991; Anderson and Kaplan, 1992; Bricker and Nehmer, 1995; Ramarapu et aI., 1997; Frownfelter-Lohrke, 1998; Almer et aI., 2003). The results, however, indicate that presentation formats do not impact decision makers' cognitive effort. These findings suggest that preparers, standardsetters and regulatory bodies should recognise that presentation format impacts on users' decision making processes and select appropriate formats that lead to improvement in decision making. Additionally, the results indicate that users' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the reporting technologies are similar across the three presentation formats. The results also show that users' perceptions do not necessary correspond to actual performance. Users' perceptions are found to influence their preferred presentation format. The findings of this study provide useful insights on users' perceptions, performances and preferences of the digital presentation formats. Such results provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the importance of perceptions and the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance. This is particularly relevant since if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, then there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of presentation. Finally, the results show that of the four recognised stages of information processing (i.e. acquisition, evaluation, weighting and judging information), functional fixation is found to only exist at the judgment stage. However, the effect of presentation format is only significant at information evaluation stage. The results indicate that the interaction between presentation formats and placement of information does not affect decision makers' information processing. This suggests that presentation formats do not solve the concern about recognition versus disclosure (functional fixation) in information processing stages. These fmdings are not consistent with Hodge et al. (2004) but are consistent with Luft and Shields (2001) who suggest functional fixation could not be alleviated because the accounting itself would affect the allocation of people's attention. This study extends the literature on presentation format by examining the quality of decision making arising from the use of different presentation formats in a digital reporting environment. It provides evidence that users' perceptions of ease of use of a presentation format do not necessarily correspond to their actual performance (cognitive effort) once a particular task has been performed. This study also provides evidence that the acceptance of a technology is highly dependent on the perceptions of that technology. Therefore, limited knowledge and appreciation of the capabilities of a technology may have the undesired effect of deterring use of the technology although it may improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Never-ending caring : the experiences of caring for a child with cerebral palsy : a thesis presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Nursing at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Klankaradi, Kuephan</field><field name="description">Cerebral palsy is one of the chronic conditions which have become a serious health burden worldwide. Consequently, this health burden involves healthcare as a whole, regardless of whether the focus is on the macro or micro system. Glaserian grounded theory was employed to explore and explain the experiences of families who have a child with cerebral palsy, particularly in the Thai cultural context. Unstructured interviews and participant observations were used along the process of data collection from 15 families who have a child with cerebral palsy. Data encompassed a variety of qualitative data sources: interviews, observational field notes, personal documents, pictures, drawings, and information from a literature review. The process of data analysis was guided by Glaserian grounded theory throughout the processes of constant comparative analysis to generate a substantive theory. The substantive theory comprised three core categories: Enduring despair, culture of obligation and responsibility and living with, which were integrated into the basic social psychological process of never-ending caring. The metaphor of a waterwheel was used to depict the basic process. The substantive theory of never-ending caring for a child with cerebral palsy provided an explicit understanding of the experiences of these families in day-to-day living with, and care of, a child with cerebral palsy. It is hoped that this understanding will be a constituent of health care - particularly of people with chronic conditions, whereby the practice of healthcare professionals will improve, thus enhancing the efforts of their work to achieve the ultimate goal of improving the quality of life of children with cerebral palsy and their families.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children with cerebral palsy</field><field name="subject">Families of cerebral palsied children</field><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321209 Family care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxygen and the ovarian follicle : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Redding, Gabe Peter</field><field name="description">The role oxygen plays in the developing ovarian follicle is of interest not only to the field of developmental biology but also to in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) technologists, as oxygenation of the oocyte is considered to be a potential determinant of oocyte competence. Oxygen transport through the developing ovarian follicle, and practical aspects of the analysis of oxygen in human follicular fluid were investigated in this work. Mathematical modelling of oxygen transport in the pre-antral, and antrallpreovulatory follicle revealed a number of interesting findings, Contrary to previous conclusions (Gosden &amp; Byatt-Smith, 1986), oxygen can reach the oocyte in the small pre-antral follicle. Improved estimates of diffusion coefficients through the granulosa cell layer and the inclusion of fluid voidage in this layer showed that oxygen can also reach the oocyte in large pre-antral follicles. The amount of oxygen that reaches the oocyte in the pre-antral follicle is a function of its size and degree of vascularisation. Symmetrically distributed vascularisation is superior in achieving a well oxygenated follicle. However, the large pre-antral follicle will eventually reach a size beyond which it cannot grow without anoxic regions developing. The size at which this occurs is consistent with the size at which antrum formation is observed in human follicles. The model predicts that the follicle can avoid an anoxic state through antrum formation, and shows that the follicle develops in a way that is consistent with overcoming mass transport limitations. The oxygen status of the follicle during the antrallpre-ovulatory phase of growth requires that the volume of granulosa cells be balanced by the volume of follicular fluid. Further predictions suggest that oocyte respiration becomes sub-maximal at follicular fluid volumes below approximately 4m1, vascularisation levels below 38%, or fluid i dissolved oxygen levels below 5.1 ~01%. These values are consistent with observations in the literature. It was also shown that the measurement of follicular fluid dissolved oxygen levels could provide a simple measure of the respiratory status of the oocyte, and this may be superior to the measurement of follicular vascularisation which requires knowledge of more parameters. Methodology for the analysis of follicular fluid oxygen solubility and diffusivity was developed using a Clark oxygen electrode. Analysis of these parameters showed that they are similar to human plasma, and allowed the predictive uncertainty of the model to be reduced. Experimental studies into the effects of IVF aspiration on follicular fluid were carried out. Aspiration results in significant changes in the properties of follicular fluid. Dissolved oxygen levels rose 5 * 2 vol%, pH increased by 0.04 * 0.01 pH units, and temperature dropped by 7.7 * 1.3 "C. Mathematical modelling of blood contaminated follicular fluid also showed that contamination results in significant changes in the dissolved oxygen of the fluid. This suggests that if the composition of follicular fluid is to be determined (particularly dissolved oxygen), sampling andlor measurement of fluid must take place before the collection vial of the aspiration kit, and blood contamination must be eliminated. Based on this result, the design and testing of devices capable of reliable sampling andlor rneasurement of oxygen levels of follicular fluid was considered. This presents a continuing challenge, including the integration of routine follicular fluid oxygen measurement into clinical practice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graafian follicle</field><field name="subject">Oxygen in the body</field><field name="subject">Oxygen Physiological transport</field><field name="subject">In-vitro fertilisation (IVF)</field><field name="subject">Ovarian follicles</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320600 Medical Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of epilepsy in Tasmania : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Epidemiology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">D'Souza, Wendyl Jude</field><field name="description">Background Better understanding of the demographic distribution of epilepsy and the prevalence of 'more specific forms of epilepsy' in community-based settings would improve our understanding of this disorder at the population level . Although we now have good estimates of epilepsy prevalence for most countries, we still lack knowledge on its demographic distribution by age, ethnicity, region, and socioeconomic status. In addition, no studies to date have reported the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes using patient interview outside a hospital setting. This thesis provides the first community-based estimates of the prevalence of the most common clinical group of epilepsies presumed to have a genetic basis - The Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsies (IGE) - by patient and witness interview. Methods This thesis has involved conducting five pieces of new research: (i) a series of reviews and analyses of descriptive data on epilepsy prevalence, particularly focusing on the critical methodological issues of ascertainment, diagnosis and classification of epilepsy for epidemiological purposes; (ii) the validation of a modified diagnostic epilepsy questionnaire adapted for administration in population studies; (iii) recruitment of a community-based cohort - The Tasmanian Epilepsy Register (TER) - through the Australian national prescription database; (iv) estimation of the overall prevalence and distribution of self-reported treated epilepsy in Tasmania by imputation methods; (v) estimation of the prevalence and distribution of IGE in Tasmania by telephone interviewing. Results My modified diagnostic questionnaire, administered by telephone interviewing and interpreted with standardized guidelines, demonstrated excellent agreement with an epilepsy specialist's clinical assessment in diagnosing the presence of epilepsy (K = 0.94), seizure-onset types (K = 0.84), simple or complex partial seizures (K=0. 87), any generalized non-convulsive seizure (K=0.82), and IGE (K = 0.82). A lthough stil l substantial, agreement was not as close for secondarily general ized seizures (K = 0.74), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (K = 0.79). 7541 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the preceding year in Tasman ia were eligible for recruitment through the Australian national prescription database. After three mail contacts, 54.0% responded, with 43.6% who indicated treatment for epilepsy representing 86.0% of total possible epilepsy cases by imputation (n=2063) in Tasmania. 1180 agreed to participate in the TER, 90.0% of participants received their AEDs either exclusively from their general practitioner (70.9%) or in combination with a medical specialist (19.1%) in the preceding twelve months. The adjusted treated epilepsy prevalence was 4.36 per 1000 (95% CI 4.34, 4.39); this was: lower in women (prevalence ratio 0.92 (95% CI 0.84, 1.00); greater with increasing age (p&lt; 0.001 ); similar in the three main geographical regions; and similar by categories of socioeconomic status based on postcode of residence. Following enrolment, 959/1083 (88.6%) eligible TER participants completed the diagnostic telephone interviewing, with partial epilepsy classified in two thirds, and generalised epilepsy in slightly more than one-fifth. IGE was observed in 20.3%, with tonic-clonic seizures (17.03%) and the absence epilepsies combined (11.01 %) being the most common IGE seizure types and syndromes respectively. The estimated prevalence of IGE was 0.89 per 1000; is highest between the ages of 20-39 years and in females, but was similar between Tasmanian regions and socio-economic groups. IGE prevalence beyond childhood related to refractory childhood or adolescent disease rather than olderonset cases, and was characterised by the presence of myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Generalised seizures, but not IGE, were less prevalent in southern Tasmania. Conclusions Utilising the design approach described in this thesis may provide an alternative to neurological assessment, and when coupled with case ascertainment through prescription data, can provide a valid estimate of the prevalence of 'more specific forms of epilepsy' in countries with high access to health services. The observed pattern of high elderly epilepsy prevalence, is similar to patterns in recent studies in other developed countries, and has important implications for future planning of health services in these countries. IGE represents a considerable proportion of community-treated disease with important aetiological and prognostic determinants occurring at the seizure rather than syndrome level of classification.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epilepsy prevalance</field><field name="subject">patient interviews</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation of sulfur assimilation in onion (Allium cepa L.) : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Physiology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Ludivine A</field><field name="description">Onion (Allium cepa L.) is an example of a species that accumulates very high levels of reduced sulfur (S)-containing compounds, particularly in the bulb as alk(en)yl-L-cysteine-sulfoxides (ACSOs) and it is these compounds, or their derivatives, that confers the distinct odour and pungent flavour. In common with higher plants, the S assimilation pathway in onion begins with the activation of uptaken sulfate (SO4 2-) to 5'-adenylylsulfate (APS), a reaction catalysed by ATP sulfurylase (ATPS; EC 2.7.7.4). Then, APS is reduced to sulfide (S2-) in a two-step process catalysed by the enzymes APS reductase (APSR; EC 1.8.4.9) and sulfite reductase (SiR; EC 1.8.7.1). To complete the reductive assimilation pathway, S2- is incorporated into the amino acid skeleton of O-acetylserine (OAS) to form cysteine, and this reaction is catalyzed by OAS (thiol)-lyase (OAS-TL; EC 4.2.99.8). While the regulation of the pathway is quite well defined in the plant model Arabidopsis, much less is known about its regulation in S accumulating species such as onion. The primary aim of this thesis, therefore, was to characterise the enzymes of the S assimilation pathway in onion, with a particular emphasis on ATPS. As part of this charaterisation two genotypes of onion were compared. These comprised a mild genotype, 'Texas Grano 438' (TG) with a lower level of S-containing compounds in the bulb tissues, and 'W202A' (W), a cultivar with a higher level of S containing compounds in the bulb tissues. As well, comparisons were made between seedlings (typically harvested at 7 weeks) and plants at a designated mature stage (at bulbing; typically after 4 months growth), and for plants grown in S-sufficient (S+) media or S-deficicnt (S-) media, as appropriate. In terms of plant growth, S-deprivation generally had a negative influence for both genotypes, with significant reductions in total biomass (measured as fresh weight) for TG at both the seedlings and mature stages. ATPS activity and accumulation were shown to be present in all tissues examined (leaf, root, bulb) as well as the chloroplasts, with highest activity measured in the roots, particularly in seedlings. ATPS activity and accumulation were also compared between the two genotypes (TG and W) with ATPS activity and accumulation higher in W, particularly at the seedling stage. In terms of the influence of S supply, in general higher ATPS activity was measured in chloroplast, leaf and root extracts from plants of both genotypes grown in the S- media, at the seedling stage. In roots of mature plants of both genotypes, a significant increase in activity was measured in response to S-deprivation, while in chloroplasts isolated from mature plants of both genotypes, highest activity was measure in those grown in the S+ media. Finally diurnal variations were observed in chloroplast, leaf and root extracts of both genotypes with a general trend of an increase in ATPS activity and accumulation a few hours after illumination and upon the onset of the dark period. Although a single gene coding for ATPS is presumed to be present in onion, the enzyme was characterized as two electrophoretic forms using 1D-PAGE during western analyses following fractionation of chloroplasts by anion exchange chromatography and also as an alignment of spots using 2D-PAGE. As protease inhibitors were routinely included in the extraction buffers, these forms suggest the occurrence of ATPS isoforms that may arise as a consequence of post-translational modifications. The regulation of ATPS by one mechanism of post-translational modification, phosphorylation, was therefore investigated using several techniques including the detection of a shift in molecular mass, a change in enzyme activity or pI (as determined by 2D-PAGE) and the capability to bind to 14-3-3 proteins using affinity chromatography. Following treatments of chloroplast extracts to promote either the phosphorylation (P+) or the dephosphorylation (P-) of proteins, no molecular mass change or change in activity was observed. However, after fractionation by 2D-PAGE, differences in the spot alignment of ATPS were visualized, suggesting that ATPS is a phosphoprotein. The enzyme was detected in pull-downs after affinity chromatography, suggesting that ATPS may also interact with 14-3-3 proteins (although this needs to be confirmed unequivocally). A model is advanced, therefore, in which upon phosphorylation, no variation in ATPS activity occurs but a change in the surface charged and possibly a change in conformation of the protein does occur to make the enzyme competent to interact with 14-3-3 proteins.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Onions</field><field name="subject">Sulphur assimilation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270201 Gene expression</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics of the Australian longicorn beetle genus Uracanthus Hope 1833 (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae: Uracanthini) : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Plant Science (Entomology) at Institute of Natural Resources, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Thongphak, Duangrat</field><field name="description">Uracanthus is a large group of longicorn beetles in the Australian Region. The larvae of this genus are borers of at least 31 genera of trees and parasitic plants, including some economically important crops such as citrus, litchi, peach, plum, and apricot. Several species are important pests of orchards. Adults visit flowers of various tree species and are attracted to the light. In this thesis, I undertook a thorough taxonomic revision, analysed the phylogeny using morphological and molecular characters, and appraised biogeographic distribution of the genus. In the taxonomic revision, I redefine the scope of the genus, describe and illustrate new and previously known species, and provide a key to all species. The revised Australian Uracanthus includes 39 species, eight of which are established as new to science: U. pseudogigas sp. nov., U. maculatus sp. nov., U. griseus sp. nov., U. bicoloratus sp. nov., U. perthensis sp. nov., U. punctulatus sp. nov., U. quadristriolatus sp. nov., and U. bistriolatus sp. nov. Six new synonyms are proposed (senior synonyms last): U. multilineatus McKeown with U. ventralis Lea, U. dentiapicalis McKeown with U. parvus Lea, U. marginellus Hope and U. inermis Lea (not Aurivillius) with U. bivittatus Newman, U. fuscostriatus McKeown with U. lateroalbus Lea, and U. daviumbus Gressitt with U. longicornis Lea. Dorsal views of all species are presented as photographs, terminalia of both sexes illustrated, and distributions mapped. Brief comments are also given on the biology of this genus. In the full morphological phylogenetic analyses of all 39 species, I use 55 informative characters and cladistic method to test the monophylies of Uracanthus and its species groups. My results show that the monophylies of the genus and seven species groups are confirmed. However, several species groups still need additional steps to become monophyletic and are currently considered paraphyletic. In the molecular phylogenetic studies, due to the situations beyond my control (difficulties of extracting DNA from some old species and prohibitions of extracting DNA from type specimens), I analyse only 21 species. I extract and amplify the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) region of the mtDNA from 21 species and perform a phylogenetic analysis using molecular characters. To make the molecular phylogeny comparable to the morphological phylogeny, I also cladistically analyse the phylogeny of these 21 species using morphological and combined morphological-molecular characters. A comparison of trees obtained from morphological, mtDNA and combined data shows that the relationships of several closely related taxa remain constant, for example, the sister relationships of U. gigas + pseudogigas, U. insignis + punctulatus, and U. acutus + loranthi. However, the placement of U. insignis and U. punctulatus on the phylogenetic trees varies from the most basal in the full morphological analysis to the highly derived in the combined and molecular analyses. Considering the amount of available data is more limited in the molecular analysis than in the morphological analysis, the molecular phylogeny presented in this study should be interpreted with caution. The Uracanthus fauna can be divided into five subregions: the Kosciuskan, Western and Eyrean in southern and central Australia, and the Torresian and Timorian in northern Australia. The fauna are richest with highest endemism in the Kosciuskan and Western. The Kosciuskan and Western are similar in faunal composition and closely related; the Eyrean has probably acted as a faunal exchange transit area between the Kosciuskan and Western, and the two northern Australian subregions have no endemic species. When the areas of endemism of each species are attached to the phylogenetic tree generated from the full morphological analysis, a clear picture of the distribution patterns of species groups in relation to phylogeny is obtained. It is suggested that the speciation and species radiation of Uracanthus may have occurred first in the Kosciuskan, then in the Western, and finally in the Eyrean, Torresian, and Timorian.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian longicorn beetle genus Uracanthus Hope 1833 (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae: Cerambycinae: Uracanthini)</field><field name="subject">Beetles</field><field name="subject">Classification</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prescribing in teaching hospitals:exploring social and cultural influences on practices and prescriber training</field><field name="creator">Page, Meredith Ann</field><field name="description">Master of Pharmacy</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prescribing practices</field><field name="subject">influences</field><field name="subject">medical training</field><field name="subject">drug therapy</field><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">medication management</field><field name="subject">organisational culture</field><field name="subject">medication safety</field><field name="subject">health professionals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Q-Curves with Complex Multiplication</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Ley Catherine</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">number theory</field><field name="subject">complex multiplication</field><field name="subject">abelian varieties</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy losses and pressure head changes at storm drain junctions</field><field name="creator">Hare, C.M.</field><field name="description">New South Wales Institute of Technology.</field><field name="date">1980</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The perceived role of community involvement in the mega-event hosting process : a case study of the Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000 Olympic Games</field><field name="creator">Haxton, Peter Anthony</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney, 2000.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy, politics and nursing: a case study of policy formation in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Frances Anne</field><field name="description">University of Technology, Sydney.

One of the intellectual characteristics of this period was the rise of ecocentrism, a form of ecological reasoning that challenged the domination of anthropocentric environmental thinking and practice. The thesis briefly reviews the evolution of ecological forms of reason, and then poses two questions. The first question asks: "What is ecological reason and how does the literature conceptualise it?" This leads to a theoretical analysis of the forms of ecological reason discernable in the literature, and results in a 'matrix of ecological reason'. The three primary forms of ecological reason are described as 'Technocentric Ecology', 'Discursive Ecology' and 'Eco-social Ecology'. They differ in respect to different dimensions of ecological reason, the forms of communication employed (drawing here on Habermas), and the level of commitment to anthropocentrism or ecocentrism. This 'matrix' highlights the contested nature of ecological reason in the literature, and demonstrates that there is, yet, no clear agreement on what it means, or should mean.  The second question examines the ecological rationality of environmental practice. The 'matrix' is employed in three case studies of environmental decisions that take place under the New Zealand Resource Management Act (RMA), and investigates the forms of ecological reason expressed in these decision processes. The results of this analysis show that Eco-social Ecology barely registers in these case studies, while the other two forms of ecological reason. Technocentric Ecology and Discursive Ecology are both highly visible in the rationality of the RMA, but with two important qualifiers. First, although there is a commitment to Discursive Ecology on the part of many professionals, there is also much concern that this form of reason undermines quality environmental decisions. Thus, there is significant ambiguity as to the role of the community (an important dimension of Discursive Ecology). This leads to the second qualifier. There is an uneasy relationship between these two forms of reason, at both the theoretical and practice level. This tension underpins the competing visions of the RMA as a scientifically driven process and as a community process. This thesis argues that this tension does not provide for a secure marriage of these two visions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resource Management Act 1991</field><field name="subject">economic aspects</field><field name="subject">environmental practices</field><field name="subject">ecological reason</field><field name="subject">environmental decision making</field><field name="subject">resource consent process</field><field name="subject">ecological rationality</field><field name="subject">sustainable development</field><field name="subject">sustainability</field><field name="subject">discursive ecology</field><field name="subject">technocentric ecology</field><field name="subject">eco-social ecology</field><field name="subject">050204 - Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">050205 - Environmental Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2127</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Effects of Species Biology, Riverine Architecture and Flow Regime upon Patterns of Genetic Diversity and Gene Flow in Three Species of Northern Australian Freshwater Fish</field><field name="creator">Huey, Joel Anthony</field><field name="description">Understanding patterns of dispersal, the movement of individuals or propagules, among populations of riverine species is imperative to their management and conservation. However, directly estimating dispersal can often be difficult. Therefore, estimates of gene flow, the movement of genes, are often used to infer dispersal among natural populations. In riverine species, gene flow is determined by species biology, riverine architecture and flow regime. While many studies investigate the role of species dispersive strategies by comparing patterns of genetic structure in different species across the same geographic range, few also attempt to investigate the role of the non-biotic influences on gene flow in a comparative manner. Instead, studies regarding landscape processes (river architecture and hydrology) are based upon observations in a single riverine environment and not compared to other catchments that may differ in riverine architecture or hydrology.
This study attempts to investigate all three factors influencing gene flow and genetic diversity using a comparative approach. This is done by contrasting two species of freshwater fish in two riverine systems that differ in their hydrological and structural makeup. By comparing patterns of genetic structure for each fish species, the role of species biology (behavioural and physical adaptations) can be explored. Then, by comparing patterns of genetic structure for each species, between riverine systems that differ in their landscape processes, the role of hydrology and riverine architecture in determining genetic structure can be explored. This study employed three different genetic markers to elucidate patterns of genetic structure and genetic diversity. These were, direct sequencing and screening of the control region of the mitochondrial DNA genome, microsatellite loci and allozymes...</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">riverine architecture</field><field name="subject">species biology</field><field name="subject">flow regime</field><field name="subject">genertic diversity</field><field name="subject">gene flow</field><field name="subject">fish species</field><field name="subject">freshwater fish</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">riverine environment</field><field name="subject">genetic structure in fish</field><field name="subject">Lake Eyre Basin</field><field name="subject">Gulf of Carpentaria Basin</field><field name="subject">Neosilurus hyrtlii</field><field name="subject">ambassis macleayi</field><field name="identifier">http://www4.gu.edu.au:8080/adt-root/public/adt-QGU20100625.135012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling Variable Viscosity Forced and Free Convection in Porous Media</field><field name="creator">Kamel Hooman</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses modeling transport phenomena in porous media with special attention being paid to convective characteristics of variable viscosity fluids in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. Two different categories of flows, with totally different driving forces, are considered being forced and free convection (both side and bottom heating, for a square enclosure, are studied). To account for property variation, the density is modeled by an Oberbeck&#8211;Boussinesq approximation while the viscosity is modeled by an exponential function. The limitations of the previous work, addressing the issue, are discussed in detail and improvements, in terms of thermo-hydraulic performance of the system are suggested. Dealing with the global aspects of the problem, the two major methods being the reference temperature and the property ratio approach are implemented. For natural convection problems, the former method is used; while for forced convection the latter is undertaken. New correlations, which are proved to be more accurate, are proposed for both forced and free convection problems. Besides, closed form solutions are reported for some cases of constant and variable viscosity. Convection visualization is also studied in detail where the concept of Energy Flux Vectors is put forward along with the application of heatlines and energy streamlines. It was mathematically shown that in two-dimensional space heatlines and energy streamlines, which were invented independently, are the same as each other. Moreover, the newly developed concept, energy flux vectors serve as a new tool for convection visualization with the main advantage that this new technique, unlike heatlines and energy streamlines, does not require further (and sometimes complicated) numerical analysis in addition to solving momentum and thermal energy equations. This, in its turn, reduces the time and computer resources required to see the flow of energy. Finally, in Chapter 7, the summary of the work along with the conclusions are presented. Finally, recommendations for future studies are put forward.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">porous media</field><field name="subject">variable property</field><field name="subject">free convection</field><field name="subject">forced convection</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">analytical</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding the growth behaviour of epitaxial InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures using electron microscopy</field><field name="creator">Mohanchand Paladugu</field><field name="description">Materials in smaller scales exhibit promising properties that are useful for wide variety of applications. Semiconductor quantum wells and quantum dots are two main examples of low-dimensional systems, where the quantum wells act as two-dimensional systems and the quantum dots act as zero-dimensional systems. Alternatively, semiconductor nanowires act as one-dimensional materials, and they exhibit promising and device applicable properties. These nanowires are relatively new class of materials compared to the quantum wells and the quantum dots. The semiconductor nanowires are expected to be the building blocks for future nanoelectronic and nano-optoelectronic device technology. Vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism is a widely used mechanism for the growth of semiconductor nanowires, where metal nanoparticles are used as the catalysts for the nanowires growth. This growth mechanism offers a flexibility to control the size, morphology and location of the semiconductor nanowires. In the VLS growth, changing the chemical composition of vapor constituents produce consequent compositional modulation in each nanowire. The compositional modulation along the nanowire axis produces axial nanowire heterostructures and in radial direction produces radial nanowire heterostructures. Such compositional modulation within an individual nanowire enables the designing of band structure of a nanowire and thereby allows the fabrication of single nanowire devices. These nanowire heterostructures show many potential properties and consequent applications. Although the semiconductor nanowire heterostructures are promising semiconductor nanostructures, the fundamental growth mechanisms of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures have not been explored sufficiently due to their complex nature of the growth. In this regard, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues associated with axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. For such fundamental investigations, this PhD work chooses InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system due to its potential applications. In fact, InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are the first reported axial nanowire heterostructure system. However, no detailed investigations were reported on this system so far. The detailed nucleation and growth mechanisms associated with InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructure system are explored in this thesis using electron microscopy investigations. This objective is achieved in the following steps. &#8226; InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are grown using Au nanoparticles and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) method. To determine the axial and radial growth evolution of InAs on GaAs nanowires, different InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are produced by depositing InAs for different durations on GaAs nanowires. The GaAs nanowires are initially grown for 30 min and then the InAs is deposited on these nanowires for 1, 3, 5 and 30 min. &#8226; These InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures are subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations. These investigations determine that, in the initial stages of the InAs axial growth (1 min), the Au particles move sidewards and subsequently downwards by maintaining an interface with the GaAs nanowire. Such a movement of Au catalysts is attributed to lower Au/GaAs interfacial energy than Au/InAs. The detailed TEM investigations show that this Au movement depends upon the crystallographic nature of the GaAs nanowire. The Au particle is always tend to move towards {112}B sidewall of the GaAs nanowire rather than its {112}A sidewalls. Increase in InAs growth duration shows that InAs branches evolve from GaAs-InAs core-shell structures. Such evolution is observed in following steps: (1) the movement of Au particle terminates when it encounters the radially grown InAs on GaAs nanowires; (2) further growth of InAs leads to the InAs nanowire growth from those terminated Au nanoparticles in the form of branches. &#8226; The TEM observations of InAs/GaAs nanowire heterostructures show that, in the initial stages of InAs radial growth on GaAs nanowires, InAs nucleates preferentially in the concave regions of the non-planar sidewalls of the GaAs nanowire. The further growth of InAs leads to the preferential formation of InAs shell structure at the regions of concave regions. Such heterogeneous formation of shell structure resembles InAs nanoring structures around GaAs nanowire cores. InAs growth on the planar {112} sidewalls of GaAs nanowires with hexagonal cross sections shows different growth phenomena to the above described InAs nanorings formation. In this case, InAs preferentially nucleates on {112}A sidewalls of the GaAs nanowires and with further deposition of InAs, the complete shell structure of InAs form with {110} sidewalls on the GaAs nanowire cores. &#8226; In addition to the above mentioned investigations, to observe the growth evolution of GaAs on InAs nanowires, GaAs is grown for 3 and 30 min on InAs nanowires. The TEM investigations of these nanostructures show that the axial GaAs/InAs hetero-interface contains an InGaAs transition segment in contrast to the sharp InAs/GaAs (InAs on GaAs) hetero-interface. The different nature of hetero-interfaces is attributed to the different affinities between Au catalysts and Ga or In. The radial growth of GaAs on InAs nanowires show that the GaAs shell has grown in wurtzite structure around the wurtzite structured InAs nanowire cores. Overall, through the extensive SEM and TEM investigations, this PhD thesis addresses the fundamental issues related to the growth of axial and radial nanowire heterostructures. Such fundamental investigations are expected to advance the processing and application prospective of the semiconductor nanowires and their associated heterostructures.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nanowires, nanostructures, heterostructures, nucleation and growth, self-assembly of matter, vapor liquid solid mechanism, materials science, nanotechnology, transmission electron microscopy, crystal growth</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:179967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Girl without hands: extract from the manuscript of a novel. The Maiden without hands: from folktale and fairy ale to contemporary novel</field><field name="creator">Melissa Ashley</field><field name="description">The Girl without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel By Melissa Jane Ashley Abstract The major component of the thesis is an extract from the manuscript, The Girl without Hands, a novelised interpretation of the folktale and fairy tale, The Maiden without Hands. The novel is composed of three books, with point of view structured as shifting third person; most of the story is narrated by the central character, Marina Fischer. The manuscript deploys a variety of fairy tale and folktale related literary techniques, including magic realism, intertextuality, framing, and fantasy. Events span a period of eight years, the action set in rural and urban parts of Queensland and Victoria. On an unsupervised picnic with friends, fourteen year old Marina Fischer&#8217;s twin sister Sonia suffers a fatal head injury. Grief-stricken and self-blaming, Marina reacts to the trauma by losing all feeling and movement in her hands. Six months following the accident, Marina seems on the verge of recovery; she attends regular therapy and is protected by her loyal friends, siblings Amelia and Sammy Jones. However, the patina of stability begins to crack when Marina is confronted at the year ten formal by Sonia&#8217;s former associates, Kylie Bates and Jody Cutter, also present at her death. Distraught and upset, Marina flees the dance in Jody&#8217;s older brother&#8217;s car. Seven years later Marina meets Matt Soverign, a gifted hypnotist, who tries to help her regain movement in her hands. They sleep together and Marina unexpectedly falls pregnant. Their son Tristram is born while Matt attends an interstate conference. Thinking a child would help her hands to heal, Marina becomes depressed when she continues to suffer from paralysis. She begins to dwell on memories of her sexual assault the night of the school dance, slowly losing touch with reality. But a phone call from her estranged friend, Amelia Jones, shakes Marina out of her stasis. Her close mate Sammy, who now lives in Melbourne, has fallen dangerously ill. With her relationship in pieces, Marina purchases train tickets for herself and Tristram and embarks upon a spontaneous&#8212;though much delayed&#8212;journey to reconcile the past. The critical component of the thesis is an essay entitled &#8220;The Maiden without Hands: From Folktale and Fairy Tale to Contemporary Novel&#8221;. Chapter one, &#8220;The Tale is Not Beautiful if Nothing is Added to It,&#8221; is a literary survey of cross-cultural folktale and fairy tale variants of the 1200 year old narrative, The Maiden without Hands. I explore academic debate regarding the literary fairy tale&#8217;s indebtedness to the oral folktale, discussing Susan Stewart&#8217;s notion of the &#8216;distressed text&#8217; and Lewis Seifert&#8217;s theory of &#8216;nostalgic recuperation.&#8217; Chapter two, &#8220;Then the Devil Will Take Me Away,&#8221; undertakes a close reading of the Grimm Brothers&#8217; influential but controversial 1857 re-write of The Maiden without Hands narrative. I suggest that Wilhelm Grimm&#8217;s suppression of the &#8216;unnatural father&#8217; episode, found in the traditional folktale, aided the story&#8217;s survival in and beyond the nineteenth century, when such themes became taboo. I explore how the Grimms&#8217; aesthetic revisions of folk material&#8212;to make them appeal to a middle class audience, including children&#8212;helped proliferate stereotyped representations of females and femininity in classic fairy tales. These depictions, I argue, often cause ambivalence in contemporary female readers, however they also instigate creative revisionary projects (such as my own), which seek to explore the residual energy contained in fairy tale texts, while at the same time destabilising their sexual stereotyping. In the last chapter, &#8220;The Only Thing She Doesn&#8217;t Have is Arms,&#8221; I discuss how extensive research into the many incarnations of The Maiden without Hands altered my understanding of the narrative&#8217;s symbols, tropes and metaphors, leading to significant changes to the plot of my novel. Citing examples from my text, The Girl without Hands, and comparing and contrasting them with excerpts from variants of the folktale and fairy tale, I analyse my creative interpretation of The Maiden without Hands&#8217; major themes: loss and lack; sexual assault and violation; creativity and writing; and, finally, healing and wholeness.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">19 Studies in Creative Arts and Writing</field><field name="subject">Fairy tale</field><field name="subject">Folktale</field><field name="subject">The Girl without Hands</field><field name="subject">Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">Novel</field><field name="subject">Conversion Disorder</field><field name="subject">Gender</field><field name="subject">Sexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:184596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taint</field><field name="creator">Cheryl Jorgensen</field><field name="description">Abstracts THE TAINT This is a memoir of Ray &#8220;Poss&#8221; Ide, a man who has carried the taint of a horrifying crime since he was seventeen years old&#9472;a crime he claims he did not commit. The crime was the rape of a fourteen-year-old girl. The Taint looks at the time leading up to his conviction for rape, including the years he spent in Westbrook Boys&#8217; Reformatory and Boggo Road Gaol as a minor, and then his sentence served in NSW gaols with such inmates as Stephen Bradley, the man who kidnapped and murdered Graham Thorne, and the bizarre but rather likeable Dave Scanlan, known for his exploits as &#8220;the Kingsgrove Slasher&#8221;. In prison, Scanlan encouraged him to become an elite sportsman and released, Poss was recruited by Canterbury Eels football team; but just on the point of making a name for himself in Sydney, someone discovered that he had been gaoled for rape, and humiliated, he left the team. He moved back home to Queensland via Grafton, NSW (where he met and later married the Jacaranda Queen) and continued his sporting career, but never again in the Big League. He became the Manager of the Waterside Workers&#8217; Club and helped prevent a turf war between the Wharfies and members of the Painters and Dockers. Poss is now working with lawyer Robert Bax to have his case re-opened. He believes his story to be a cautionary tale for young men. It is a chronicle of social change, including the sexual revolution of the sixties, the confrontations with &#8220;the demons&#8221; in the streets of Brisbane during the Joh era of Bible-bashing fundamentalism and police corruption. It&#8217;s a story about what really went on behind closed doors in institutions where vulnerable children were preyed upon, in gaols where men were expected to become beasts. It is a story of how the taint of a terrible crime affected a man&#8217;s whole life. &#8220;QUESTIONS OF OWNERSHIP&#8221; Writing someone else&#8217;s story can be an ethical minefield&#9472;especially regarding questions of ownership. Who owns the story, the subject or the author? The easy answer to this is the subject owns the story and the author the text, but on closer examination this may not necessarily be so. Then there are those other stakeholders who claim ownership of story: people who embrace a narrative because of its similarity to their own lives. Published stories about institutional abuse have resonated for adults who as children were placed into the care of churches or the state. Another kind of ownership is claimed by readers who accept a version of a story and dismiss any counter-story as being invalid. What I call the &#8220;Plath Phenomenon&#8221; is an example of this. I will examine these kinds of ownership of story with particular reference to the work of Janet Malcolm on biography and then will look at gaps and silences in &#8220;official&#8221; stories, those created in police stations and courtrooms.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">police corruption, injustice, Bjelke-Petersen, unions, verballing, court transcripts, sportsmanship, prison life, Westbrook, tainted evidence.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:185968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and Function of Binuclear Metallohydrolases: Enterobacter aerogenes glycerophosphodiesterase and related enzymes</field><field name="creator">Kieran Hadler</field><field name="description">This thesis is focussed on structural and functional studies of a novel glycerophosphodiesterase (GpdQ) from Enterobacter aerogenes. GpdQ is highly promiscuous and is the first known phosphatase which is capable of degrading all three classes of phosphate esters (mono-, di- and triesters). Remarkably, GpdQ is also able to hydrolyse stable aliphatic phosphate esters and has been shown to degrade the hydrolysis product of the nerve agent VX. For these reasons, GpdQ has been realised to have potential as a powerful bioremediator for the removal of organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents. GpdQ is a binuclear metallohydrolase in which one of the metal ions is very weakly bound. Chapter 1 introduces the catalytic mechanisms of binuclear metallohydrolases by examining two related phosphate ester-degrading enzymes. Since one of the main features of catalysis addressed in this thesis are the differential metal binding affinities of GpdQ, Chapter 1 also canvasses a range of other binuclear metallohydrolases with similar behaviour. Chapter 2 examines the structural and evolutionary relationship between GpdQ and a number of other related enzymes. Using genome database searches, the two most closely related enzymes are identified. In performing these searches, a novel, putative binuclear metallohydrolase from Homo sapiens is also discovered. This enzyme, Hsa_aTRACP, is most closely related to PAPs, however construction of a homology model indicates that the active site tyrosine residue of PAP is replaced by histidine. In this respect, it may represent an evolutionary link to Ser/Thr protein phosphatases and GpdQ. The biology and chemistry of this putative enzyme is discussed. PAPs are the only binuclear enzymes with an established heterovalent active site of the type Fe(III)-M(II) (where M=Fe, Zn or Mn) whereas the majority of enzymes in this family have homovalent metal centres, including GpdQ and Ser/Thr protein. This is brought about due to the nature of the coordination sphere imposed by the enzyme. The activity of GpdQ can be reconstituted in the presence of Co(II), Zn(II), Mn(II) and Cd(II). Chapter 3 examines the kinetic properties of a binuclear homovalent system by studying the kinetic properties of Cd(II)-substituted GpdQ and a corresponding model complex. This comparative study leads to the identification of a terminal hydroxide molecule as the likely reaction-initiating nucleophile in Cd(II)-GpdQ with a pKa of 9.4. In Chapter 4, a detailed study of the structural, kinetic and spectroscopic behaviour of Co(II)-substituted GpdQ is presented. This chapter specifically probes the formation of the binuclear active site, the role of the metal ions in catalysis, the identity of the nucleophile and the potential role of any first or second coordination sphere residues in the regulation of enzyme activity, proton donation and metal ion coordination. Based on these findings, a detailed reaction mechanism is proposed in which the substrate itself promotes the formation of the catalytically competent binuclear centre and phosphorolysis occurs following nucleophilic attack by a terminal hydroxide molecule. A potential role of Asn80 (a ligand of one of the metal ions) in regulating both substrate and metal binding, and the role of the bridging hydroxide molecule in the activation of the terminal nucleophile is proposed. Chapter 5 employs a combination of kinetic and spectroscopic techniques to probe the proposed catalytic mechanism of GpdQ in depth. The formation of the catalytically competent binuclear centre is observed in pre-steady state studies, an integral first step in the catalytic mechanism. The dissociation and rate constants associated with formation of the binuclear centre are quantified. The rate of substrate turnover in GpdQ is relatively modest but is enhanced by a structural rearrangement involving the flexible Asn80 ligand. This structural change fine-tunes the reaction mechanism, leading to optimal reactivity. The steady-state kinetic properties of a series of metal ion derivatives (Co(II), Cd(II) and Mn(II)) of GpdQ and their reactivity towards a number of substrates are also compared. These findings lead to the conclusion that the reaction mechanism of GpdQ is modulated by both substrate and metal ion. In this respect, GpdQ is adaptive to the environmental conditions to which it is exposed by employing a flexible mechanistic strategy to achieve catalysis. Chapter 6 correlates the electronic and geometric structure of the binuclear centre in GpdQ as a means to probe specific aspects of the mechanism. This study uses the wild type enzyme and a site-directed mutant (Asn80Asp) to examine the structure of the metal ions at two stages of catalysis. The role of the bridging hydroxide molecule in nucleophilic activation is specifically addressed by monitoring changes in the electronic exchange interaction and other structural parameters as a result of phosphate binding. Also, the coordination environment of the metal ions in both the free enzyme and the phosphate-bound enzyme of wild type and Asn80Asp GpdQ were assessed against the currently proposed structures. The findings in this chapter corroborate the proposed catalytic mechanism of GpdQ. In summary, this project led to a detailed understanding of the mechanism of GpdQ, and provided insight into how both the metal ion composition and the identity of the substrate may modulate this mechanism. The knowledge gained may lead to the design of catalytically more efficient derivatives (mutants) of GpdQ for application in bioremediation.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glycerophosphodiesterase</field><field name="subject">phosphoesterase</field><field name="subject">binuclear metallohydrolase</field><field name="subject">magnetic circular dichroism</field><field name="subject">stopped-flow fluorescence</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">electron paramagnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:186121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of the Field River as a refuge for small vertebrates in the Simpson Desert</field><field name="creator">Carissa Free</field><field name="description">More than two-thirds of Australia is classified as arid or semi arid and receives less than 500 mm of rain annually. Throughout these arid areas, rivers and drainage lines (which often have their catchments in higher rainfall areas) act as arteries for vast amounts of water to flow into these dry landscapes. Many inland rivers, including the Paroo, Bulloo and Cooper Creeks, have highly variable flow rates and can go many years with very little or no flow. As a result of the hydrology of these areas, they contain different soil characteristics and vegetation communities from the surrounding arid landscapes. For example, soil nutrients are thought to be higher along drainage lines and on floodplains due to sediment deposition and decomposition of organic material. Also, vegetation in these areas needs to not only survive drought conditions (as a plant or propogule), but also periodic inundation and flood events. These characteristics are thought to make these areas more productive than the surrounding arid lanscapes and are thought to be important habitats for flora and fauna. There has been much debate over the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrate species. Several studies internationally in mesic areas have suggested that riparian corridors contain higher levels of biodiversity than the surrounding habitats, although this pattern is not replicated in all areas or for all taxonomic groups. Many of these studies suggest that the difference in biodiversity between riparian areas and adjacent habitats should be greater in xeric areas where the habitat differences between these areas are greatest. Other studies have suggested that diversity is not necessarily greater but riparian areas are important habitats for different species and may act as a refuge for some species. In Australia, very few studies have been conducted on the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrates in arid areas, despite these habitats being under threat from grazing, flow alteration and flow diversion. In this study I examined the role of the Field River in the Simpson Desert as a potential refuge for vertebrate species and compared diversity and population dynamics of vertebrates at dune and riverine sites. Specifically this study aimed to: 1) determine if species richness of vertebrates along the Field River was greater in riverine ecosystems than the surrounding dune habitats; 2) quantify how the riverine habitats differed in terms of floristics, vegetation complexity, soils and water availability from the surrounding landscapes; 3) determine the dynamics of terrestrial vertebrate populations along the Field River; and 4) determine if the abundance, diversity and demographics of small vertebrate populations along the Field River was different from populations in the sand dune fields on a broader landscape scale. These questions were examined on Ethabuka Station in the Simpson Desert, Queensland, from 2006 to 2008. The riparian corridor along the Field River was found to have a range of characteristics that make it unique from the surrounding dune habitats. Soils along the riverine corridor were found to be characterised by more than 20% clay while soils on the dune crest were characterised by no more than 5% clay. Further, soil carbon and nitrogen was significantly higher in the riverine corridor than in the dune habitats and decreased with distance from the catchment. Spinifex (Triodia basedowii) cover was low in the corridor but dominated the dune swale. Number of trees and cover by trees and non-spinifex grasses were also significantly higher in the riverine corridor when compared to the surrounding dunes. Following the rainfall, annual cover was also significantly greater and they persisted much longer than in the dunes. There was very little difference in the diversity or number of invertebrates between the different habitat types. Species richness was estimated to be highest (48 species) in the riverine centre and lowest in the floodplain (30 species). The riverine habitats had different species pools when compared to the dune habitats. Several species including Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella exclusively inhabited the riverine habitats while others such as the skinks Ctenotus ariadnae and Ctenotus dux were captured only in the dune habitats. Results from a Canonical Correspondence Analysis suggest that the distribution of some species in arid areas, such as the introduced House Mouse (Mus musculus), may be correlated with habitat characteristics associated with the riverine corridor, e.g. soil moisture or high annual cover. Abundance, body condition and reproduction of mammals along the Field River was generally driven by time. On a local scale, habitat had little effect on the abundance of the Sandy Inland Mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis) and Lesser Hairy-footed Dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni), although M. musculus showed some preference for the riverine corridor. Abundance and reproduction of both rodent species increased following rainfall while S. youngsoni abundance was strongly seasonal with increases in abundance in autumn and winter. More than 45% of all captures were reptiles and this group was the most diverse and conspicuous fauna group along the riverine corridor. Abundance of the two most common lizard species, the Military Dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis) and Central-netted Dragons (Ctenophorus nuchalis), was significantly affected by time, with the abundance of both species decreasing dramatically 12 months after rainfall, possibly due to increased predation. Abundance of the Beaked Gecko, Rhynchoedura ornata, began to decrease prior to rainfall, suggesting a factor other than habitat structure or food availability causing the decline. The skink, Lerista labialis, showed strong seasonal trends in abundance and body condition, which suggested that within the desert riverine corridor the species was not reliant on rain-induced changes in food availability. To compare the effect of habitat on species richness, composition and population dynamics at a regional scale, sites along the riparian corridor were compared with dune sites located 500 m to 45 km from the Field River. On this scale, species species richness varied spatially with only one of the riverine sites having higher estimated species richness than the dune sites. Species turnover was greater in riverine sites despite the habitat data suggesting that primary production in these sites was more stable. Some species were able to persist at riverine sites at all times of the year but were only present in the community at dune sites following rainfall, suggesting that the riverine sites may be a more stable habitat for some species. Composition analysis revealed that dune and riverine habitats contain different communities, and some species, particularly Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella, probably rely on the river for their habitat requirements. Population dynamics including abundance, reproduction and body condition of seven species were compared between dune and riverine habitats. Only four, M. musculus, L. labialis, C. nuchalis and S. youngsoni, showed any significant affect of habitat on abundance. Abundance of C. nuchalis, S. youngsoni and L. labialis were generally more abundant in the dune habitats although the affect was only significant for some sampling sessions. The only species that was significantly more abundant in the riverine habitats than dune habitats was the introduced M. musculus. This species appears to be reliant on the riverine corridor, only appearing commonly in the dune habitats following rainfall. For most species, the number of juveniles captured increased following the rainfall in January 2007 but only in C. nuchalis and P. hermannsburgensis was there any significant difference between habitat types. For both species, generally more juveniles were captured in the dune habitats than in the riverine habitats. This study provided information on the role of the Field River to vertebrate fauna on Ethabuka Station. Although, the study focused only on one ephemeral desert river, it could be considered representative of similar desert rivers such as the Hay, Plenty and Hale rivers further west in central Australia. The riverine corridor did represent a different habitat to the surrounding sand dunes, and some characteristics, such as greater soil moisture, soil nutrients and annual cover, suggest that it may have greater and more stable primary production. Although the species studied did not generally have greater abundance and body condition, or reproduce more in the riverine corridor, many species including the Long-nosed Dragon (Amphibolurus longirostris), Desert Tree Frog (Litoria rubella) and Pygmy Mulga Monitor (Varanus gilleni) are likely to rely on the habitat that the riverine corridor provides. With expanding human populations placing greater pressure on rivers around the world, particularly in arid areas, it is imperative that we understand the ecology of these riparian systems so that effective management and conservation strategies can be developed.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">dynamics</field><field name="subject">fauna</field><field name="subject">composition</field><field name="subject">Simpson Desert</field><field name="subject">Field River</field><field name="subject">vertebrates</field><field name="subject">diversity</field><field name="subject">rivers</field><field name="subject">desert</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:187151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Critical Commentary</field><field name="creator">Ian Cresswell</field><field name="description">Not available</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:193003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology. These data demonstrate young children&#8217;s sophisticated understandings of their doing~learning~living. As well as opening possibilities for adults to understand children&#8217;s understandings, the data open possibilities for children&#8217;s understandings to inform adult understandings of curriculum, as practiced, theoretical and philosophical, that is, for receiving children into curriculum.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Early childhood</field><field name="subject">Children</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="subject">Reconceptualising curriculum</field><field name="subject">Deleuze</field><field name="subject">Play</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:180106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Native noise: M&#257;ori popular music and indigenous cultural identity</field><field name="creator">Breault, Ainsley</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that M&#257;ori popular music, regardless of genre, is a valuable resource in the formulation of a vibrant and relevant M&#257;ori rangatahi (youth) identity. Specifically, the research investigates the complex relationship between popular music, social space, and M&#257;ori culture and community in Aotearoa. The researcher interviewed six participants from within the M&#257;ori music community and practiced participant observation at popular music events. The findings of this qualitative research are framed by an in-depth literature review into questions of M&#257;ori identity, as well as an application of ethnomusicology theories on the relationship of music to place and community. The research output includes both a 30-minute documentary and this accompanying exegesis, which frames the documentary within relevant fields of scholarship and presents a critical analysis of its successes and weaknesses. The researcher elected to create a documentary in recognition of the medium&#8217;s ability to maintain the voice of the research participants, capture the dynamism of the M&#257;ori popular music scene, and increase the potential for the research to reach a wider audience. The use of documentary also allows for an exploration of the relationship between music and documentary, and begins a discussion on the potential of socially-conscious rockumentaries to reveal crucial social issues. Finally, the exegesis questions the ethics of outsider filmmaking, and explores how the concept of &#8216;Kaupapa M&#257;ori filmmaking&#8217; influenced the process of making the film.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en_NZ</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori</field><field name="subject">popular music</field><field name="subject">documentary</field><field name="subject">ethnomusicology</field><field name="subject">rangatahi</field><field name="subject">social space</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genes for sodium exclusion in wheat.</field><field name="creator">Byrt, Caitlin Siobhan</field><field name="description">Salinity stress limits the growth and productivity of agricultural crops in many regions of the world. Whole plant tolerance to soil salinity involves numerous processes in many different tissues and cell types. For many cereals, sensitivity to salinity is due to the accumulation of sodium (Na&#8314;) to toxic concentrations in the leaves. This thesis investigates a mechanism of control of Na&#8314; accumulation in leaves of wheat. Bread wheat excludes sodium from the leaves better than durum wheat. Bread wheat is hexaploid (AABBDD) whereas durum wheat is tetraploid (AABB). The D-genome in bread wheat carries a major locus for sodium exclusion, Kna1, which may contribute to the differences in sodium exclusion between bread wheat and durum wheat. An unusual durum wheat, Line 149, excludes sodium to a similar degree as bread wheat. Line 149 was derived from a cross between a Triticum monococcum (accession C68-101; AA) and a durum wheat (T. turgidum ssp. durum cv. Marrocos; AABB). Line 149 had been found to contain two major genes for sodium exclusion, named Nax1 and Nax2, which appeared to retrieve sodium from the xylem sap in the roots and so prevent it reaching the leaves. Line 149 had been crossed with the durum wheat cv. Tamaroi, which accumulates high concentrations of Na&#8314; in the leaves, and near-isogenic single-gene mapping populations had been developed for Nax1 and Nax2. Nax1 had been located on chromosome 2A. The objective of this thesis was to map Nax2 and identify a candidate gene. Nax2 mapped to chromosome 5AL based on linkage to microsatellite markers. A high-affinity potassium (K&#8314;) transporter (HKT)-like gene, HKT1;5 was considered as a candidate gene for Nax2, based on similarity of the phenotype to a rice orthologue. Sequence information from a wheat HKT1;5-like expressed sequence tag in the public database was used to develop a probe for use in Southern hybridsation. A HKT1;5-like fragment was identified in Line 149 and T. monococcum C68-101, but was absent in Tamaroi. The HKT1;5-like gene, named TmHKT1;5-A, co-segregated with Nax2 in the Nax2 single-gene mapping population. The HKT1;5 probe identified three putative HKT1;5-like genes on the long arm of chromosome 4B, and one HKT1;5-like gene on the long arm of chromosome 4D, in Langdon (T. turgidum ssp. durum) substitution lines, and in Chinese Spring (T. aestivum) ditelomeric lines. No A-genome HKT1;5 like gene was identified in Langdon or Chinese Spring. The D-genome HKT1;5 gene, named TaHKT1;5-D, was found to co-locate with Kna1, the gene for sodium exclusion in bread wheat, in Chinese Spring chromosome 4D deletion lines. Nax2 (TmHKT1;5-A) was found to be homoeologous with the gene for sodium exclusion in bread wheat, Kna1 (TaHKT1;5-D). TmHKT1;5-A and TaHKT1;5-D, and their promoters, were 94% identical, and both were expressed in the roots of wheat plants. This is consistent with the genes being located in the stele of the roots and retrieving Na&#8314; from the xylem sap as it flows towards the shoot, and so excluding Na&#8314; from the leaves. A marker for TmHKT1;5-A was developed to track this gene in durum wheat breeding programs. A study of the HKT1;5 gene in diploid ancestors of wheat indicated that this gene is present in most Triticum monococcum accessions, some T. boeoticum accessions, but not present in any T. urartu accessions. T. urartu is the likely A genome ancestor of modern wheat. This may explain the absence of HKT1;5 in the A genome of modern wheat. The protein encoded by TaHKT1;5-D transported sodium when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The inward currents were specific to Na&#8314;, but at particular mole fractions of Na&#8314; and K&#8314; outward currents were observed that were consistent with outward K&#8314; transport. These data were consistent with the putative physiological function, of retrieving Na&#8314; from the xylem sap as it flows to the leaves, and resulting in a net exchange with K&#8314;. A construct designed to silence the expression of TaHKT1;5-D was introduced to bread wheat cv. Bob White. Nineteen putative transgenic plants were developed. The leaf Na&#8314; concentrations and genotype of the T1 individuals were assayed. The data from two of the transgenic plants indicated that TaHKT1;5-D may have been silenced and that this may have lead to the increase in Na&#8314; accumulation in the leaves. However, this data is not conclusive at this time. The information gained from this study will assist the introduction of the Na&#8314; exclusion trait into current durum cultivars, which are poor at excluding Na&#8314; and are salt sensitive. This information will also contribute to the body of knowledge of ion transport in plants and salinity tolerance in wheat.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salt tolerance; wheat; Triticum aestivum; sodium exclusion</field><field name="subject">Wheat Genetics</field><field name="subject">Sodium</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Grapevine root hydraulics: the role of aquaporins.</field><field name="creator">Vandeleur, Rebecca</field><field name="description">Hydraulic conductance of roots of the grapevine cultivar, Chardonnay, varies diurnally, peaking at 1400 h. The diurnal amplitude of hydraulic conductance between 600 and 1400 h was not altered when potted grapevines were water-stressed by withholding water for 8 days. However, the diurnal change was greatly reduced for water-stressed Grenache. If the diurnal change in root hydraulic conductance is a result of changes in aquaporin gene expression or activity, it suggests that aquaporins respond differently in water-stressed Chardonnay and Grenache roots. Both Chardonnay and Grenache demonstrated a reduction in hydraulic conductance in response to water stress, with Grenache exhibiting a larger reduction. Suberisation of the roots increased in response to water stress, with complete suberisation of the endodermis occurring closer to the root tip of Grenache compared to the more drought sensitive Chardonnay. The drought sensitive rootstock, 101-14 (V. riparia &#215; V. rupestris) demonstrated a similar reduction in hydraulic conductance to Chardonnay, while drought tolerant 1103 Paulsen (V. berlandieri &#215; V. rupestris) had a non-significant reduction when water-stressed compared to the large reduction observed for drought tolerant Grenache. Therefore, in this study the degree of reduction in hydraulic conductance did not relate to the drought tolerance of the four varieties examined. The impact of partial drying (watering only half the root system) on hydraulic conductance also differed between Chardonnay and Grenache. There was no change in the conductance of the whole root system of Chardonnay due to an increase in conductance of the roots in the wet half which compensated for the reduction on the dry side. In contrast, Grenache did suffer a reduction measured over the whole root system due to a much larger reduction on the dry side compared to Chardonnay. There was an increase in hydraulic conductance on the wet side but this could not compensate for the large reduction on the dry side. Two aquaporins (VvPIP1;1 and VvPIP2;2) were cloned from the roots of grapevine cultivar Chardonnay. The genes were expressed in Xenopus oocytes to determine their osmotic permeability. As has been shown in a number of plant species, VvPIP1;1 was only slightly permeable to water, whereas VvPIP2;2 did transport water. However, when VvPIP1;1 was injected into the oocytes with VvPIP2;2, there was a substantial increase in the osmotic permeability. There was no significant variation in the diurnal expression of VvPIP2;2, whereas VvPIP1;1 showed a peak in expression at 1000 h prior to the peak in hydraulic conductance and peaked again at 1800 h. VvPIP2;2 did not vary in transcript level in response to water stress or rewatering in Chardonnay or Grenache roots. The level of VvPIP1;1 doubled in water stressed Chardonnay roots and declined again when the vines were rewatered 24 h previously. This response to water stress did not occur in Grenache roots. The roots used were from the apical 5 cm. Similar roots were used to measure the water permeability of the cortical cell membranes using the cell pressure probe. Changes in cell membrane permeability in response to water stress corresponded to changes in VvPIP1;1 expression. An experiment to determine if shoot topping had an effect on root hydraulic conductance revealed a significant 50% decline. This response was also observed in soybean (Glycine max L.) and maize (Zea mays L.). A range of experiments have been performed to determine the reason for the decline. Possibilities included a response to final leaf area and reduced transpirational demand; loss of a carbohydrate sink; or hormonal signals such as abscisic acid, auxin and ethylene. At this stage the nature of the positive or negative signal that causes the change in root hydraulic conductance remains elusive. However, the signal did cause a reduction in the transcript level of VvPIP1;1, indicating the involvement of aquaporins in the response. The root hydraulic conductance of grapevines is variable and dependent on factors such as time of day, water-stress, transpiration rate and unknown signals from the shoot. A proportion of this variability is due to changes in aquaporin number or activity. There are also genotypic differences which may be beneficial for future breeding efforts to improve water use efficiency of grapevines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydraulic conductance; aquaporins; roots; grapevine; water stress</field><field name="subject">Soil moisture.</field><field name="subject">Grapes.</field><field name="subject">Aquaporins</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology and behaviour of Pachycephala rufogularis and P. inornata (Aves: Pachycephalidae) in woodlands of South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Moise, Dragos</field><field name="description">Since European settlement, the woodlands and associated habitats, especially in the temperate zones of Australia, have been extensively cleared and converted to arable land and pastures. Much of the remaining vegetation in the agricultural zone occurs as small isolated patches prone to disturbance and degradation. Apart from habitat loss and fragmentation, altered fire regimes, periods of intense drought, and the introduction of exotic plants and animals, have contributed to the deterioration of most of the natural habitats across Australia, with a negative impact on the native wildlife, including birds. Many woodland bird species have undergone widespread declines, culminating in some local or even regional extinctions. In the mallee woodlands of south-east Australia two closely related species of whistlers (fam. Pachycephalidae) &#8212; Red-lored Whistler Pachycephala rufogularis and Gilbert&#8217;s Whistler P. inornata &#8212; have overlapping ranges, and in some areas they co-exist. These two species are morphologically and ecologically similar. However, despite the similarities, P. rufogularis has undergone greater declines in distribution and abundance than P. inornata. The ecology of these two species is poorly known, which renders adequate management impracticable. The major objectives of this thesis were to determine the key habitat requirements for the two species, to determine their habitat use, and to document the ecology and behaviour of the two species, particularly their foraging, and intra- and interspecific interactions. A sound knowledge of the ecology of the two species is needed to underpin appropriate actions for their management and conservation. Morphological features were measured from skins of P. rufogularis and P. inornata in the South Australian Museum collection, and from captured live birds, to detect if any aspect of the morphology could indicate possible niche partitioning between the two species. Also, the use of biometry as a tool for separating the sexes for P. rufogularis, for determining the species of the uncoloured immature birds and for sexing immatures, was evaluated. No morphological feature suggested niche partitioning. The biometry did not prove a very reliable tool for distinguishing sexes in adult P. rufogularis, but reliably identified the species of the uncoloured immatures. Sexing immatures based on biometrical data alone was not possible. Research was conducted in two main South Australian parks: Gluepot Reserve and Ngarkat Conservation Park. Ecological and behavioural data for P. rufogularis and P. inornata were collected by observing marked (colour-banded and radio-tagged) and unmarked individual birds of both species and sexes, over a two-year period from June 2004 to May 2006. The home ranges of P. rufogularis and P. inornata were determined by tracking the movements of birds in the landscape. Pachycephala rufogularis had much larger home ranges than P. inornata, especially when breeding. The striking differences in home range size between the two ecologically similar species might be related to differences in site fidelity. Pachycephala rufogularis at Gluepot was sedentary, being detected in the same locations throughout the year, and over several years. On the contrary, P. inornata generally showed poor site fidelity, being more mobile, and shifting home ranges between and within seasons. In the field the two species were segregated by habitat. Pachycephala rufogularis and P. inornata showed different habitat preferences, even in areas where they did not co-occur. Pachycephala rufogularis favoured low mallee with Triodia on sand dunes, while P. inornata favoured tall mallee with sparse shrub understorey in interdunes, but also other habitats, such as prickly Acacia thickets and Casuarina woodlands. However, both species used the mallee- Triodia with Callitris vegetation type. The key to coexistence in this habitat was a behavioural one, P. inornata acting as a subordinate species. Pachycephala rufogularis had strict habitat requirements, with the presence of Triodia being critical for the presence of the species. In contrast, P. inornata was more flexible in its habitat requirements, and used a broader range of vegetation types, being more of a habitat generalist. The investigation of habitat use from both a spatial and temporal perspective confirmed that both species actively selected habitat, and that the habitats they selected differed. The core areas of home ranges predominantly contained the preferred habitat for both species. In both species, core areas of home ranges of breeding individuals (where generally the nests were placed) contained preferred habitat in higher proportion than core areas of non-breeding birds. This suggests that during breeding, both species are more restricted to, and/or use more intensely the preferred habitat than when not breeding. The foraging behaviour did not differ consistently between the two species, both capturing insects mostly by snatching in canopy foliage, and also by gleaning on the vegetation, at different heights. However, the two species were already segregated by habitat. Thus the resource partitioning occurred spatially, at the macrohabitat level. In the instances when individuals of both species foraged in the same area and used the same resources, resource partitioning occurred at a temporal scale. Both species were generalists in foraging; therefore, a presumed foraging specialisation as a possible factor related to the decline of P. rufogularis was ruled out. Pachycephala rufogularis and P. inornata are unlikely to be competitors. Support for this argument came from the situation at Ngarkat, where P. inornata was absent. Despite this, P. rufogularis did not use a broader range of vegetation types in Ngarkat, as would be expected under &#8216;competitive release&#8217;. Instead the species maintained strict habitat requirements, specializing virtually on a single vegetation type. The rigid habitat requirements of P. rufogularis, together with its sedentary nature, render this species vulnerable to disturbances, such as wildfires. On the other hand, the apparent flexibility in habitat requirements and greater mobility may explain why P. inornata has been more successful than its sibling species. The information on habitat requirements, preference and use, and also on home ranges of P. rufogularis and P. inornata provided in this study should be included in future habitat suitability models and predictive models for these species, which will assist in their management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ecological behaviour; declining woodland birds</field><field name="subject">Pachycephalidae.</field><field name="subject">Birds Ecology South Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-Ludic Learning for Low ICT-Aware Areas :an Experiment in Tepeaca, Puebla, Mexico</field><field name="creator">Dominguez, Luis Carlos</field><field name="description">While researchers in the developed world have focused on the benefits of incorporating engaging forms of ICT (such as games) into education, comparatively little research has been done on the impact of ICT in no-access regions.

Different milk protein ingredients at various concentrations (0 to 10%, w/w) affected markedly and differently the pasting behaviour of 10% (w/w) rice starches. SMP delayed the pasting of both rice starches by increasing the onset temperature (Tonset) and the peak viscosity temperature (Tpeak) of pasting. This was mainly due to the presence of lactose and ions, which was further supported by the investigation of the effects of UFSMP (a solution of salts and lactose present in SMP at their proper concentration) and lactose. The addition of NaCAS also delayed the pasting of rice starch; Tpeak in the case of both starches was increased. For normal rice starch paste, MPC and WPI decreased the Tpeak. MPC had no affect on Tpeak of waxy rice starch paste. The qualitative viscoelastic behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient gels obtained from the above pastes was dominated by the continuous phase made of the starch molecules. There was evidence, as indicated by confocal microscopy, of phase separation between the milk proteins of SMP and MPC and the two starches. The phase separation was not observed in the addition of either NaCAS or WPI. Studies on the thermal behaviour of rice starch/milk protein ingredient mixtures by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that SMP, similarly to UFSMP, delayed the gelatinization of both starches. NaCAS also delayed the gelatinisation of both starches but had a greater effect on waxy than normal rice starch. The addition of NaCAS did not affect Tonset but increased Tpeak for normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinisation temperature of waxy rice starch was highly affected by the addition of NaCAS with both Tonset and Tpeak shifted to higher temperatures. MPC had no affect on the gelatinization temperature of normal rice starch, whereas the gelatinization temperature of waxy rice starch was increased by the addition of MPC. The addition of WPI to both rice starches showed two thermal transitions. The first of these was due to the gelatinisation of the starches and the second to the denaturation of &#223;-lactoglobulin (&#223;-lg). The addition of WPI to normal rice starch showed that the thermal behaviour of normal starch and protein were independent from each other. In contrast, the thermal behaviour of waxy rice starch was modified by the addition of WPI; both Tonset and Tpeak were increased. SMP decreased the Tonset of swelling, swelling ratio and the amount of starch leaching from both starches. These observed changes were due to the presence of lactose and ions in SMP. NaCAS slightly increased Tonset of swelling but the amount of starch leaching was reduced for both rice starches. The rigidity of both starches tended to increase in the presence of NaCAS. MPC and WPI affected the swelling behaviour of normal and waxy rice starch differently. A dramatic increase in the swelling of normal rice starch/MPC or WPI mixtures was observed, whereas this trend was not evident for waxy rice starch/ MPC or WPI mixtures. The difference in the water holding ability and gelatinization peak temperatures of the two starches over the temperature range at which whey proteins denature and form gels are believed to be responsible for the observed differences. The results from confocal microscopy showed that milk proteins, such as a-casein, &#223;- casein, &#223;-lg and a-lactalbumin (a-la), were adsorbed onto the granule surface of both normal and waxy rice starch. The mechanism for this adsorption is the hydrophilic interactions; hydrogen bonds between hydroxyl group from terminated glucan molecule that protrude around starch granule surface-hydroxyl; amino, or other electron-donation or electron-accepting groups of the added proteins. Using sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) it was found that for SMP and MPC the adsorbed as- to &#223;-casein ratio on both starches was similar to the as-casein to &#223;- casein ratio in the casein micelle at low SMP and MPC concentrations. But at high concentrations of SMP or MPC, this ratio decreased indicating that more &#223;-casein was adsorbed preferentially to as-casein. In the case of NaCAS, as-casein was adsorbed preferentially to &#223;-casein. Moreover, there was evidence of multilayer adsorption of ascasein into the surface of rice starch granules. Compared to the other milk protein ingredients, very small amounts of the &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI were adsorbed onto starch granules. However, the adsorbed amounts of &#223;-lg and a-la from WPI continuously increased with increasing WPI concentration, suggesting that these two proteins, particularly &#223;-lg, adsorbed in multilayers too.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waxy rice starch</field><field name="subject">lactoglobulin</field><field name="subject">gelatinazation</field><field name="subject">adsorption</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290104 Other food sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic agriculture: an empowering development strategy for small-scale farmers? A Cambodian case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beban, Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis explores claims that organic agriculture may be an empowering development strategy by investigating the impacts of conversion to organic farming systems on the lives of small-scale farmers in Cambodia. The thesis interrogates the diverse uses and abuses of the term =empowerment&#8216; in development rhetoric and argues for an empowerment model that is derived from farmers&#8216; self-defined concepts of development. This model was used to conduct a qualitative case study involving semistructured interviews and focus groups with members of organics initiatives in seven diverse Cambodian communities. Results indicate that many farmers in all communities felt that their most important objective was not only to achieve food security, but to be able to grow sufficient rice to feed their family. Farmers joined the organics initiatives primarily to improve their health and reduce the cost of farming inputs. As a result of joining the initiatives, all farmers (including both certified and non-certified organic farmers) felt they had improved their health and food security. Most farmers also increased incomes, created stronger family and community ties and felt they had more control over their livelihoods. These benefits were not, however, distributed equally amongst individuals or communities. Very poor and isolated farmers could not generally access benefits. The three main factors that determined the impact of the organics initiatives on farmer empowerment were identified as: the individual&#8216;s level of resources, the strength of the farmer group, and the policies and values of the supporting organisation. The implications for future initiatives are, firstly, the tremendous potential for farmers and wider rural communities to benefit from organic agriculture as a development strategy. However, this study also shows that if organics is to be viable for low-resource people, it may be necessary to promote both resources and techniques in organics initiatives. Also, a focus on building strong relationships both within the farmers group and linkages with local and wider stakeholders may enhance long-term sustainability of organics initiatives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic farming</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">development strategy</field><field name="subject">development initiatives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic responses of calves to the noxious sensory input of slaughter by ventral neck incision and its modulation with non-penetrative captive bolt stunning : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physiology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Troy John</field><field name="description">Slaughter by ventral neck incision (VNI) is performed on some animals without prior stunning in New Zealand and other countries. A single incision with a razor sharp blade is made in the ventral aspect of the neck, sectioning both carotid arteries and jugular veins, though, not the vertebral arteries. There are a number of potential welfare concerns surrounding slaughter by VNI including pain due to the incision, which may lead to distress during the time before loss of consciousness. The aims of this thesis were to identify cortical responses indicative of noxious stimulation due to slaughter by VNI using analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum and to investigate the effects of non-penetrative captive bolt (NPCB) stunning on these cortical responses. The studies utilised adaptations of a minimal anaesthesia model, which has been validated in a range of mammalian species. Surgical dehorning was used as a validation technique for this methodology in cattle and demonstrated a &#8216;typical&#8217; EEG response to noxious stimulation. Cattle slaughtered by VNI without prior stunning produced specific responses in the EEG that strongly indicated responses to noxious stimulation. Causation was investigated in cattle where blood flow through the brain remained intact during neck tissue incision (NTI) or the major blood vessels of the neck were isolated and transected independently of other neck tissues (BVT). The response to neck incision in intact animals was principally due to the noxious sensory input due to incision of neck tissues and not mainly as a result of loss of blood flow through the brain. NPCB stunning produced states of cortical activity that were incompatible with the maintenance of sensibility and pain perception. Experimental examination of the time to onset of undoubted insensibility was attempted in cattle subsequent to a pilot study in sheep. The generation of somatosensory-evoked potentials was problematic in cattle. The conclusions of this thesis are that incision of neck tissues during slaughter without prior stunning constitutes a substantial noxious stimulus. Were an animal conscious, this stimulus would be perceived as painful until the onset of hypoxiainduced insensibility. This would represent a significant compromise to animal welfare.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">animal stress</field><field name="subject">cattle slaughter</field><field name="subject">cortical response</field><field name="subject">pain perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300505 Anatomy and physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Digital reporting formats and users of financial reports : decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the context of recognition versus disclosure : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Accountancy, Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ghani, Erlane K.</field><field name="description">The evolvement of digital reporting has changed the way financial information is prepared and disseminated (Debreceny and Gray, 200 1 ). Previous research has shown that digital reporting has increased, particularly in the last five years, and this usage is characterised by greater volumes of business and financial information over that traditionally provided in print-based mode (Smith, 2003). The new opportunities and benefits offered by digital reporting are matched by challenges and implications not only for the preparers and auditors but also for users. It is expected that in the near future, financial reporting will move entirely from the primarily print-based mode to digital-based mode as the primary information dissemination channel (Oyelere et aI., 2003; Fisher et aI., 2004). Research in the area of digital reporting has been conducted in the past decade. Within this research, a considerable number of issues have been raised. These issues relate to various parties, such as policy makers, preparers, auditors, system designers and users. While several research questions and hypotheses concerning these parties have been posed and investigated, most of the research questions and hypotheses have been formed from a preparers' perspective, leaving the examination of issues from a users' perspective largely unexplored. This study focuses on users. It examines the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance in relation to decision quality, perceptions and cognitive information processing in the digital reporting environment. It aims to extend the digital reporting literature. This study extends the existing body of knowledge on digital reporting environment in several ways. First, this study examines the effect of presentation formats on the quality of users' decision making. This study follows Kleinmuntz and Schkade (1993) who described 'decision quality' in the context of two cost-benefit dimensions in relation to decision makers' cognitive processes, namely decision accuracy and cognitive effort. Decision accuracy reflects the ability of a strategy to produce an accurate outcome while cognitive effort reflects the total cognitive expenditure incurred in completing a task. Second, this study examines users' perceptions of three digital presentation formats: PDF, HTML and XBRL. This study compares subjects' perceptions of usefulness and ease of use of the three presentation formats with their actual outcome. It also includes examining whether perceptions are an important factor in influencing preferred presentation format. Finally, this study examines whether digital presentation formats address the concern over functional fixation in the accounting context of 'recognition versus disclosure' in the reporting of financial information. This study used public accounting practitioners in New Zealand as participants. Sixty two subjects participated in the experiment, which involves an experiment exercise and a post experiment questionnaire. The results indicate that presentation formats impact on decision accuracy. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted using non-digital presentation formats such as tabular and graphical in the psychology and information systems literature (Stock and Watson, 1984; Dickson et aI., 1986; Iselin, 1988; DeSanctis and Jarvenpaa, 1989; Mackay and Villareal, 1987; Hard and Vanacek, 1991; Stone and Schkade, 1991; Anderson and Kaplan, 1992; Bricker and Nehmer, 1995; Ramarapu et aI., 1997; Frownfelter-Lohrke, 1998; Almer et aI., 2003). The results, however, indicate that presentation formats do not impact decision makers' cognitive effort. These findings suggest that preparers, standardsetters and regulatory bodies should recognise that presentation format impacts on users' decision making processes and select appropriate formats that lead to improvement in decision making. Additionally, the results indicate that users' perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of the reporting technologies are similar across the three presentation formats. The results also show that users' perceptions do not necessary correspond to actual performance. Users' perceptions are found to influence their preferred presentation format. The findings of this study provide useful insights on users' perceptions, performances and preferences of the digital presentation formats. Such results provide a holistic and comprehensive view of the importance of perceptions and the effect of presentation formats on decision makers' performance. This is particularly relevant since if more advanced forms of digital reporting are to be encouraged, then there is also the need for users to be made more aware of the benefits to be gained from the different forms of presentation. Finally, the results show that of the four recognised stages of information processing (i.e. acquisition, evaluation, weighting and judging information), functional fixation is found to only exist at the judgment stage. However, the effect of presentation format is only significant at information evaluation stage. The results indicate that the interaction between presentation formats and placement of information does not affect decision makers' information processing. This suggests that presentation formats do not solve the concern about recognition versus disclosure (functional fixation) in information processing stages. These fmdings are not consistent with Hodge et al. (2004) but are consistent with Luft and Shields (2001) who suggest functional fixation could not be alleviated because the accounting itself would affect the allocation of people's attention. This study extends the literature on presentation format by examining the quality of decision making arising from the use of different presentation formats in a digital reporting environment. It provides evidence that users' perceptions of ease of use of a presentation format do not necessarily correspond to their actual performance (cognitive effort) once a particular task has been performed. This study also provides evidence that the acceptance of a technology is highly dependent on the perceptions of that technology. Therefore, limited knowledge and appreciation of the capabilities of a technology may have the undesired effect of deterring use of the technology although it may improve performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decision-making</field><field name="subject">Technology acceptance</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology of epilepsy in Tasmania : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Epidemiology at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">D'Souza, Wendyl Jude</field><field name="description">Background Better understanding of the demographic distribution of epilepsy and the prevalence of 'more specific forms of epilepsy' in community-based settings would improve our understanding of this disorder at the population level . Although we now have good estimates of epilepsy prevalence for most countries, we still lack knowledge on its demographic distribution by age, ethnicity, region, and socioeconomic status. In addition, no studies to date have reported the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes using patient interview outside a hospital setting. This thesis provides the first community-based estimates of the prevalence of the most common clinical group of epilepsies presumed to have a genetic basis - The Idiopathic Generalised Epilepsies (IGE) - by patient and witness interview. Methods This thesis has involved conducting five pieces of new research: (i) a series of reviews and analyses of descriptive data on epilepsy prevalence, particularly focusing on the critical methodological issues of ascertainment, diagnosis and classification of epilepsy for epidemiological purposes; (ii) the validation of a modified diagnostic epilepsy questionnaire adapted for administration in population studies; (iii) recruitment of a community-based cohort - The Tasmanian Epilepsy Register (TER) - through the Australian national prescription database; (iv) estimation of the overall prevalence and distribution of self-reported treated epilepsy in Tasmania by imputation methods; (v) estimation of the prevalence and distribution of IGE in Tasmania by telephone interviewing. Results My modified diagnostic questionnaire, administered by telephone interviewing and interpreted with standardized guidelines, demonstrated excellent agreement with an epilepsy specialist's clinical assessment in diagnosing the presence of epilepsy (K = 0.94), seizure-onset types (K = 0.84), simple or complex partial seizures (K=0. 87), any generalized non-convulsive seizure (K=0.82), and IGE (K = 0.82). A lthough stil l substantial, agreement was not as close for secondarily general ized seizures (K = 0.74), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (K = 0.79). 7541 patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the preceding year in Tasman ia were eligible for recruitment through the Australian national prescription database. After three mail contacts, 54.0% responded, with 43.6% who indicated treatment for epilepsy representing 86.0% of total possible epilepsy cases by imputation (n=2063) in Tasmania. 1180 agreed to participate in the TER, 90.0% of participants received their AEDs either exclusively from their general practitioner (70.9%) or in combination with a medical specialist (19.1%) in the preceding twelve months. The adjusted treated epilepsy prevalence was 4.36 per 1000 (95% CI 4.34, 4.39); this was: lower in women (prevalence ratio 0.92 (95% CI 0.84, 1.00); greater with increasing age (p&lt; 0.001 ); similar in the three main geographical regions; and similar by categories of socioeconomic status based on postcode of residence. Following enrolment, 959/1083 (88.6%) eligible TER participants completed the diagnostic telephone interviewing, with partial epilepsy classified in two thirds, and generalised epilepsy in slightly more than one-fifth. IGE was observed in 20.3%, with tonic-clonic seizures (17.03%) and the absence epilepsies combined (11.01 %) being the most common IGE seizure types and syndromes respectively. The estimated prevalence of IGE was 0.89 per 1000; is highest between the ages of 20-39 years and in females, but was similar between Tasmanian regions and socio-economic groups. IGE prevalence beyond childhood related to refractory childhood or adolescent disease rather than olderonset cases, and was characterised by the presence of myoclonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Generalised seizures, but not IGE, were less prevalent in southern Tasmania. Conclusions Utilising the design approach described in this thesis may provide an alternative to neurological assessment, and when coupled with case ascertainment through prescription data, can provide a valid estimate of the prevalence of 'more specific forms of epilepsy' in countries with high access to health services. The observed pattern of high elderly epilepsy prevalence, is similar to patterns in recent studies in other developed countries, and has important implications for future planning of health services in these countries. IGE represents a considerable proportion of community-treated disease with important aetiological and prognostic determinants occurring at the seizure rather than syndrome level of classification.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epilepsy prevalance</field><field name="subject">patient interviews</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321202 Epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tongan mothers' contributions to their young children's education in New Zealand = Lukuluku 'a e kau fa'&#275; Tonga' ki he ako 'enau f&#257;nau iiki' 'i Nu'u Sila : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Education at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">MacIntyre, Lesieli I. Kupu</field><field name="description">This study investigates the complex nature of how Tongan mothers in New Zealand contribute to their young children's ako (learning, and general education) in their homes, in the early childhood centre and primary school settings, and in church and the community. It argues that the mothers' contribution to their children's ako is based mainly on their cultural background, educational experience in Tonga, and their Christian faith, plus new knowledge they have picked up in New Zealand. Through the use of talanoa (conversation, questions and discussion) in Tongan and English languages, data were gathered from a small community in a town in the North Island, New Zealand and were coded, analysed, and presented. The participants draw on skills and knowledge of child-rearing strategies and educational practices experienced in Tonga before their migration to this country. However, when implemented in New Zealand, some aspects prove contradictory to the current practice in Aotearoa. The mothers find these emerging tensions frustrating, yet ongoing, but new learning in this country and their Christian faith help enhance their practice. The findings show that the mothers' use of Tongan language, cultural values, beliefs, and practices, with the lived experience of their Christian faith, is effective in teaching the children social and moral education, while contributing to their academic learning and still be preserving their Tongan culture, language, and identity. The mothers' shared use of Tongan language, cultural values and Christian faith enable them to create and maintain good relationships with teachers and other mothers for making worthwhile contributions to their children's ako in the selected contexts. Most of the mothers are involved in most activities, and nearly all participate where Tongan language is used and Tongan culture and Christianity are practised. It is acknowledged that some contributions create dilemmas and mismatches of expectations between the women and mainstream educational institutions. The women's efforts, accessing information in Tongan, and operating in education using faka-Tonga ways, and creating warm relationships among the mothers, teachers, and children who contribute to one another's learning reveal the complex nature of mothers' contributions to their children's education. They shuttle from one context to another, using their faka-Tonga ways, views and practices to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities, while going through transformation in their participation. Based on these findings, implications for mothers, teachers/educators, researchers, and policymakers are considered, and suggestions for future research directions are made that may benefit the growing Tongan population since it is they who have the main responsibility for young Tongan children's ako in Aotearoa-New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="subject">Parent participation</field><field name="subject">Tongans</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330103 Sociology of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variable rate application technology in the New Zealand aerial topdressing industry</field><field name="creator">Murray, Robert Ian</field><field name="description">Greater use of technology to assist aerial application of fertiliser will be of benefit to the topdressing industry and farmers. Benefits arise through automating the fertiliser flow control system; reducing off target fertiliser application, and managing fertiliser inputs based on the potential outputs of the farmland; thus increasing the profitability of hill country farming systems. A case for technology assisted application is developed by investigating the field performance of conventional and enhanced flow control systems and the effect of variable rate application on hill country pasture production. A single particle model that predicts flight trajectory from the particle force balance based on the aircraft groundspeed, axial and tangential propeller wash, wind characteristics and particle properties including sphericity was developed. Model predictions were compared to predictions from AGDISP 8.15. Results and trends were similar. The single particle ballistics model described above was extended to predict the lateral distribution of fertiliser after release from an aircraft. To achieve this, two parameters are important, the transverse flow profile of material leaving the hopper gatebox and the sphericity of the particles. Techniques for measuring these parameters are described and experimental results are presented for superphosphate. These data were used in the model to predict the lateral distribution pattern from a Gippsland Aeronautics 200C for a known discharge mass, which was compared to a measured pattern from the same aircraft for the same discharge mass. Good agreement between the shapes of the two distributions was found. The transverse distribution model provides a practical tool for optimising the design of spreaders, or optimum particle characteristics for a given spreader. It has the ability to predict the distribution profile of any particle size distribution from each, or all, of the spreader ducts. Culmination of the single particle and transverse distribution models led to the development of a deposition footprint model that was capable of predicting field application within a 25 ha trial site. The deposition footprint model was embedded inside a geographical information system and comparisons were made between the actual and predicted deposition across a series of transect lines. Good agreement was found. Following this, a comparison of the predicted field performance between an automated and manual control system were made. Economic benefits for a single application of superphosphate were identified through using automated control, where 10% less fertiliser was applied outside of the application zone when compared to the manually operated system. This equated to a net benefit of NZD $2800 for a 1500 ha hill country farming system. The value of improving the performance of a topdressing aircraft, on an industry level, was also examined. Cost/benefit analysis between a manual and automated system revealed a benefit of NZD $111,700 yr-1 for a single topdressing aircraft using the automated system. The economic impact of Variable Rate Application Technology (VRAT) is examined, using Limestone Downs as an example. The spatially explicit decision tree modelling technique was used to predict the annual pasture production over the entire Limestone Downs property. The resulting decision tree classes tended to follow the farm's digital elevation model. A series of six different fertiliser application scenarios were developed for comparison to a base line scenario using conventional aerial application techniques. VRAT outperformed the fixed rate applications in terms of pasture production and fertiliser utilisation. Full variable rate application and a model optimised prescription map, produced the highest annual pasture yield. Variable rate techniques were predicted to increase annual production and the spatial variability of that production. An economic analysis of the six production scenarios was undertaken. Farm cash surplus was calculated for each scenario and clearly revealed the benefits of using variable rate application technology. VRAT was found to be the most efficient and highest returning application method per hectare. Additional costs and increased charge-out rates were likely to occur under VRAT; nevertheless, the analysis indicated that significant financial incentives were available to the farmer. A sensitivity analysis revealed that even with a 20% increase in charge-out rate associated with VRAT, the farm's annual cash position varied by only $4500 (0.4%), suggesting the cost of implementing such a system is not prohibitive and would allow aircraft operators to add value to their services.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aerial fertilising</field><field name="subject">Fertiliser spreaders</field><field name="subject">Automation</field><field name="subject">Agricultural Engineering</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::299900 Other Engineering and Technology::299901 Agricultural engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aid project exit strategies: building strong sustainable institutions</field><field name="creator">Engels, Jeffrey Edward</field><field name="description">Foreign aid project exit strategies that contribute to sustainable development have been rarely considered throughout the history of development studies and practice. The philosophical underpinnings of early development were based on economic theories. Over the years initiatives have manifested themselves by investments through international aid projects. As aid projects are donor-driven, most exit strategy planning involves closing down a project without turning it over to another organization to continue implementation. This means that aid benefits end with whatever impact the project has made, leaving ill-equipped local ministries or under-resourced NGOs to meet local development needs and fill the gap of terminated services. The project cycle&#8212;a popular development tool used by multinational and bilateral organizations alike&#8212;provides a framework to induce development, but makes no accommodation for an exit strategy that perpetuates development.  This is a missed opportunity that reveals a flaw in the project cycle. This flaw can be corrected by revising the project cycle implementation stage to include building the capacity of people to perform the functions the project was designed for, as well as a local implementing entity through which they can work. Once accomplished, a sponsor can transfer project activities and resources to the local implementing entity though a phase-over process to extend development post-project for ongoing impact.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international development, exit strategies, phase-over, aid effectiveness, sustainable development, capacity-building, institution-building, participatory development, empowerment, localization, putting people first, social capital, USDA, Marketing Assistance Project, Center for Agribusiness and Rural Development, Armenia</field><field name="identifier">http://repository.unimelb.edu.au/10187/8502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dialogical dancing: illuminating dimensionality in solo dance practice</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Fiona</field><field name="description">This research manuscript directly pertains to and partially documents my practice-led solo investigation Dialogical Dancing as undertaken toward the Masters of Choreography (by Research).

Maori attitudes to land have not been well understood by successive New Zealand governments since that time, nor by many Pakeha New Zealanders. In an effort to overcome that lack of understanding, this thesis studies a particular genre of Maori composition; namely, waiata tangi or songs of lament, which contain a strong indigenous sense of place component. The waiata used in this study derive from my tribal area of Taranaki, which is linked historically and through whakapapa with Whanganui iwi. These waiata were recorded in manuscript form in the 1890s by my great-grandfather Te Kahui Kararehe, and are a good source from which to draw conclusions about the traditional nature of Maori feelings for place. Two strands run throughout this thesis. The first examines the nature of Maori feelings for place and land, which have endured through primary socialisation to the present day. By focusing upon a form of expression that reveals the attachment of Maori towards their ancestral homelands, it is hoped that the largely monocultural Pakeha majority in New Zealand will be made aware of that attachment. It is also hoped that Pakeha may be suitably informed of the consequences of colonialist intervention in the affairs of the Maori people since 1840, which have resulted in cultural deprivation and material disadvantage at the present day. In the current climate of government moves to address the problems bequeathed them by their predecessors, it is important that the settlement of land claims and waterways under the Treaty of Waitangi should proceed unhindered by misapprehension and misinformation on the part of the public at large. The second strand of my thesis concerns the waiata texts themselves, which I wish to bring to the attention of the descendants of the composers of those waiata, who may or may not know of their existence. Since so much of value has been lost to the Maori world it is important that the culturally precious items that remain should be restored as soon as possible to those to whom they rightfully belong. Key themes examined in this thesis are the nature of Maori "feelings" for place and a "sense" of place; Maori research methodologies and considerations, including Maori cosmology and genealogical lines of descent; ethical concerns and intellectual property rights; ethnographic writings from the nineteenth century which tried to make sense of Maori imagery and habits of thought; the Kahui Papers from which the waiata were drawn; and the content and imagery of the waiata themselves. I also discuss the use of hermeneutics as a methodological device for unlocking the meanings of words and references in the waiata, and present the results both from a western sense of place perspective and a Maori viewpoint based on cultural concepts and understandings.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">confiscation</field><field name="subject">ethnography</field><field name="subject">hermeneutics</field><field name="subject">indigenous</field><field name="subject">intellectual property rights</field><field name="subject">land</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">Moutoa Gardens</field><field name="subject">research ethics</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">Taranaki</field><field name="subject">Treaty of Waitangi</field><field name="subject">waiata tangi</field><field name="subject">Whanganui</field><field name="subject">sense of place</field><field name="subject">050208 - M&#257;ori Environmental Knowledge</field><field name="subject">200207 - M&#257;ori Cultural Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10182/2137</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical activity leisure-time participation of boys with developmental coordination disorder</field><field name="creator">Poulsen, Anne Adele</field><field name="description">Background: Boys with DCD have lower rates of participation in leisure-time physical activities, which are important developmental contexts for males, than boys without DCD. There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD. These leisure-time social-physical activity patterns of boys with DCD contributed to significantly lower physical activity energy expenditure rates for the previous week's outof- school hours when compared to energy expenditure of boys without DCD. Correlation analyses showed that more time spent in social-physical activities was positively associated with global life satisfaction, general self-concept and perceived freedom in leisure, and was negatively associated with loneliness for all boys. Therefore, the relationships between these variables were further investigated for mediation effects. Results of Mediation Analyses: Team sports were identified as the only significant activity participation context that mediated relationships between physical coordination ability and two outcomes: global life satisfaction and loneliness. Psychological processes contributing to team sport participation were also investigated. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as a significant psychological mechanism mediating the relationship between physical coordination ability and team sport participation. When the relationships between physical coordination and different levels of energy expenditure were investigated it was found that self-perceptions of peer relations changed the negative relationship between level of physical coordination ability and participation in low energy expenditure activities. Mediation analyses for relationships between boys' physical coordination ability and selfperceptions of life satisfaction and general self-concept were undertaken. Significant mediators of these relationships included: self-concept appraisals of physical ability and appearance, peer and parent relations, and adoption of task-oriented goals. Perceived freedom in leisure partially mediated the relationship between physical coordination ability and global life satisfaction. C O ~ C ~ U S ~ O ~ S : Team sports participation was positively associated with life satisfaction, perceived freedom in leisure, social satisfaction, general self-concept and moderate to vigorous energy expenditure for boys aged 10 to 13 years. From a physical and mental health perspective the finding that boys with DCD spent significantly less time in team sports and in all social-physical contexts than boys without DCD was of concern because these leisure-time contexts provide developmentally important sources of enjoyment and friendship-building for young males. When descriptive analyses were conducted it was found that boys with DCD had lower general self-concept, global life satisfaction, task goal orientations and perceived freedom in leisure than boys without DCD, and also reported more loneliness than their well coordinated counterparts. These results provide convincing evidence that parents, teachers and practitioners must be vigilant and address potential physical and mental health-related concerns for boys with DCD. The finding that a small number of boys with DCD participated in both team sports and informal group physical activities was encouraging and consistent with previous research describing ongoing and active participation in social-physical activities for a few determined adolescents with DCD. This prompted the investigation of psychological mechanisms that might support participation in social-physical activity contexts and protect against negative outcomes, such as loneliness, or promote positive outcomes, such as life satisfaction. Perceived freedom in leisure was identified as one mechanism that contributed to the positive relationships between physical coordination ability and both team sport participation and global life satisfaction. Participation in team sports, itself, was found to be a process variable changing the negative relationship between physical coordination ability and loneliness, and positively contributing to life satisfaction for all boys irrespective of physical coordination ability. Further investigation of the features of team sport environments that protect against loneliness and which promote life satisfaction is warranted. Researchers and practitioners are challenged to consider the four components of perceived freedom in leisure as psychological factors that potentially underpin decisions about choice, effort and time spent in team sport settings. Perceived freedom in leisure was regarded as having potential to inform models such as SCOPE-IT model which guided these investigations. However, further research with more representative populations is required to verify these preliminary findings. In addition, in keeping with the premise of the SCOPE-IT model, investigations of environment-level variables are required to fully understand the fit between child, activity and environment factors. This study moved beyond a descriptive analysis of the psychosocial features and leisuretime activity participation patterns of boys with DCD. The identification of mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation in team sports, life satisfaction and loneliness was regarded as having potential to inform clinical practice, theory development and lead to future research initiatives aimed at promoting and maintaining health, contributing to the formulation of policies and preventive health strategies for these children.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecodesign for Large Campus Style Buildings</field><field name="creator">Ms Marci Webster-Mannison</field><field name="description" /><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating recovery planning for threatened species in Australia</field><field name="creator">Alejandro Ortega Argueta</field><field name="description">Loss of biodiversity is a major environmental issue in Australia. In response the Commonwealth Government has developed a national list of threatened species and prepared recovery plans under the provisions of the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBCA). However, knowledge on the appropriateness and effectiveness of those conservation and management schemes is limited. The aim of the thesis was to conduct an evaluation of recovery planning to assess its appropriateness as a conservation and management instrument, and investigate how legislative, institutional and organisational factors influence its implementation. Four research questions were addressed: 1) How does recovery planning operate in regard to legislative, jurisdictional and institutional aspects? 2) Do recovery plans comply with legislative requirements and coherent conservation planning? 3) What management factors have most influence on implementation of recovery plans at state level? and 4) What modifications could be made to the management system to improve implementation of recovery plans? The major approaches considered in this study were policy evaluation and systems analysis. Both approaches were incorporated in a framework of the thesis to construct a conceptualisation of the threatened species management system as a model. This allowed examining its structure, key elements and dynamics, and evaluation of its performance and effectiveness. Methods comprised interviews, content analysis of program documentation, qualitative and quantitative analysis of recovery plans, experts&#8217; workshops, and systems analysis and modelling. The major set of quantitative data came from a database which incorporated content attributes of 236 recovery plans. Taking into account the Australian legislative requirements for preparing recovery plans, key content attributes were selected for assessing the degree of compliance. Internal consistency of plans was also assessed as a complementary measure of coherent management planning. Measures of internal consistency were: consistency between gaps of scientific information versus prescribed actions calling for research; consistency between major threatening processes versus prescription of threat abatement actions; and consistency between recovery objectives versus performance criteria for measuring achievement of objectives. Another component of the thesis was the construction of a model of the management system of threatened species. This theoretical model was conceptualised from opinions of experts and stakeholders occupying key roles in threatened species management. The model incorporated social aspects of management such as institutional and organisational factors influencing planning and the implementation of recovery plans. The model was built using a Bayesian belief network to assess the most influential components (issues, recovery strategies, and management requirements) on the likely outcomes. Expert opinions also assisted to identify gaps in the management system and formulate new management strategies. Finally, modelling allowed assessing different management scenarios and identified the key components that would improve recovery planning. Major findings of the investigation revealed that: 1) Although the three levels of government in Australia (Commonwealth, state/territory and local) are involved in recovery planning, it is the states/territories that have the most active role in preparing and operating recovery plans. State and territory-based legislation, policy and conservation strategies shape the form in which recovery planning is performed nationwide, as they are responsible for implementing 89% of national plans; 2) Overall compliance of plans with legislative requirements was adequate; although improvement is required in establishing a monitoring and evaluation framework. Overall, internal consistency of plans was also adequate in addressing threats and formulating research for knowledge gaps; but consistency was poor regarding the response to some threatening processes and the establishment of recovery criteria; 3) According to experts/stakeholders, the most influential issues relevant to the implementation of recovery plans are: coordination across Commonwealth, state and territory agencies, inconsistency of strategies and programs across jurisdictions, addressing management of threatened species on private land, incorporation of science into recovery planning, prioritising schemes for conservation action, and funding for the implementation of plans; 4) The recovery planning strategy may be improved by establishing mandatory monitoring and review reports; creating a national forum on threatened species; designing an appropriate insurance regime for volunteers; and establishing a national management information system.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">Threatened species management, recovery planning, biodiversity conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:178617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Re(con)ceiving children in curriculum: Mapping (a) milieu(s) of becoming</field><field name="creator">Sellers, Margaret</field><field name="description">Tradition and convention dichotomises children and curriculum and this is challenged by re(con)ceiving children in curriculum. My study generates ways for thinking differently about children&#8217;s complex interrelationships with curriculum by working with the philosophical imaginaries of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari. I use an assemblage of imaginaries, namely: rhizome, plateaus, multiplicities, nomad, de~territorialising lines of flight, smooth spaces, becoming, milieu, monad and singularities, all of which disrupt traditional and conventional thought in various ways. Working with children to share their understandings of curriculum, demonstrated in their curricular performativity of becoming~learning, becomes a complex methodological endeavour, which inextricably (rhizomatically) entwines researching and researcher/participants and research. What I call the assemblage of the thesis is thus as much about researching rhizomatically as about young children&#8217;s understandings of curriculum and Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries help bring these together. Rhizome and becoming are two imaginaries that feature frequently in the discussion and in the methodology, with plateaus comprising the condition and expression of the &#8216;thesis&#8217; cum assemblage. However, as plateaus work non-linearly, the conventional notion of a chaptered thesis is rendered sous rature. Hence the thesis-assemblage becomes a milieu of plateaus that can be read in any order, rather than a conventional linear sequence of chapters containing specific sections of the research process. Continuing with generating a milieu (while simultaneously disrupting linearity) both the literature review and rhizoanalysis occur in various plateaus, and the rhizo-methodology is played out throughout. Bringing my understanding of Deleuzo-Guattarian imaginaries of rhizome and becoming into theories about children and childhood and bringing the notion of rhizome together with young children&#8217;s curricular performance opens possibilities for conceiving children and curriculum differently, and for receiving these into reconceptualist curricular conversations. A poststructuralist feminist theoretical approach works to destabilise developmental perspectives of children and childhood as well as the adult|child binary, and recognises curriculum as a complex endeavour. The interconnected processes of rhizo inquiry, rhizomatic methodology and rhizoanalysis engage with emerging understandings of researching complexity and further disrupt modernist, arborescent thought. Data for the study were generated in a kindergarten during a two-week period by moving rhizomatically with the activity of children&#8217;s play while video recording their games. Mostly I operated the camera, with the children preferring to be performers in these spontaneous video plays, but periodically various children took the camera and recorded activity of their choosing, thereby generating another dimension to the data. As and when requested by the children, they watched the videos of themselves at play, with opportunities for replaying sequences and engaging in conversation about their becoming~learning. These review sessions were recorded on a second video camera, contributing to an intensifying multiplicity of data. To continue generating this data multiplicity, I approached the rhizoanalysis in several ways &#8211; through conventional transcripts, visual notations and by juxtaposing interactive pieces using the literature, transcriptions from the data and my commentaries. For example: data were juxtaposed with philosophical imaginaries; data from both cameras were read alongside one another; data of the children playing were used to inform the methodology as well as the methodology being used to inform the rhizoanalysis; transcriptions were turned into storyboards and some play episodes were mapped pictorially. Determining conclusions is not the purpose of a rhizomatic research multiplicity. Instead I leave off with thoughts for the reader about ongoing and opening processes of thinking differently around curriculum as (a) milieu(s) of becoming and children as dynamically becoming(s)-child(ren). Rhizomatically, these link to data used to explain map(ping) play(ing), children performing curriculum complexly, children&#8217;s expressions of power-fullness and children performing rhizo-methodology.

There is evidence that variable developmental trajectories exist although factors contributing to an optimal child- activity-environment fit are poorly understood Therefore, identifying the processes influencing leisure-time physical activity participation patterns, and the impact that low participation has on subjective quality of life is a clinical and research priority. Identifying factors and circumstances that promote or inhibit successful adaptation to physical coordination difficulties has potential to contribute to the mental and physical health of boys with DCD. In this thesis psychological mechanisms influencing leisure-time participation and subjective quality of life were explored with a view to informing an ecological open systems model called SCOPE-IT (Synthesis of Child-, Occupation-, and Environment- in Time), developed to conceptualise the multiple inputs from child-, activity- and environment-level factors that contribute to health and well-being. Objectives: The first research priority was to identify mediation processes influencing relationships between physical coordination ability and leisure-time participation. Three psychological process variables were investigated; perceptions of freedom in leisure, self-concept perceptions and dispositional goal motivations. Three quality of life-related outcomes related to subjective quality of life were also explored; global life satisfaction, general self-concept and loneliness. Differences between these variables for boys with and without DCD were compared before mediation processes were investigated as the key research initiative of the thesis. Method: Sixty boys with DCD and 113 boys without DCD completed self-report measures of the psychosocial variables under consideration. Parents completed a retrospective recall of leisure-time behaviour over the previous 12-months and a 7-day diary for the out-of-school hours. The 7-day diary recorded intensity, duration, content, social and physical context of leisure-time activities. Results of Descriptive Analyses: Boys with DCD had lower mean scores than boys without DCD for perceived freedom in leisure and self-concept appraisals for physical ability, physical appearance, peer and parent relations, general self-concept and global life satisfaction. Higher loneliness was reported by boys with severe and moderate DCD than boys without DCD who had medium to high levels of physical coordination. Lower participation in team sports and informal group physical activities, but higher participation in structured groups, such as choir, that involved low levels of physical activity energy expenditure, were found for boys with DCD compared to boys without DCD.

The first, an exegesis, sets my creative work in a literary, stylistic and social context. The second and main part of this submission is the first draft of a novel, Sleep, Sister, which I have written over the course of the last year. [Note: the draft novel is embargoed until 31 May 2011.]  The exegesis explores issues such as the history of the road novel, alienation and loneliness within society, and in particular within families. It also discusses the novel as a coming of age story, with its main characters being members of Generation X, those born between 1960 -1980. This was the first generation of New Zealand children for whom divorced parents and blended families were common experiences. The exegesis also describes how the themes of the story have informed the style, narrative and characterisation of the book. It concludes with the main question of the novel; whether the two main characters &#8211; sisters &#8211; can overcome their damaging past.  The novel is set in New Zealand, predominantly in the year 1987, although there are flashbacks to the girls&#8217; 1970s childhood. It is written mainly in the present tense and with shifting points of view.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">first draft novel</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">True fictions: The basis of identity and contextual reality in narrative performativity</field><field name="creator">Brampton, Fear Taitimu</field><field name="description">The thesis project focuses on the narrative and uses identity as its subject matter.

The overall aim of the thesis was to investigate links between increasing coastal water-column nitrogen concentrations (derived from terrestrial inputs) and the expansion of turf-forming habitats that can alter the structure and function of subtidal ecosystems. I initially tested whether human activities in coastal catchments can increase subsidies of nitrogen to open rocky coasts. I identified landscape-scale variation in the supply of Dissolved Inorganic Nitrogen (DIN) to coastal waters adjacent to natural, agricultural and urban catchments. Compared to natural catchments, subsidies of DIN were 8 - 407 times greater in urban catchments, and 1 - 63 times greater in agricultural catchments. Subsidies of nitrogen from urban catchments were attributed to the release of sewage effluent, as delineated by &#948;&#185;  &#8309;N isotopic values of transplanted algae. Having made this link, I then assessed whether catchment-scale variation in nitrogen subsidies may predict patterns of subtidal habitat structure, particularly as related to theories of regime shifts from forested landscapes to structurally depauperate turf-forming habitats. I validated this hypothesis, demonstrating that both relative covers and patch-sizes of turfed habitat were greater where the ratio of terrestrial nitrogen inputs to ambient coastal resources was large. An important realisation was that loss of forests may be more strongly related to the size of subsidy (i.e. the relative increases in water column nitrogen concentrations along urban coasts) rather than the size of coastal populations. Together, these data link coastal development with modified land-to-sea subsidies, and indirectly support the model that ecological effects may be proportional to the disparity between donor and recipient resources. Having demonstrated a link between nitrogen subsidies and subtidal habitat change, I then investigated factors likely to initiate and maintain such shifts. My results demonstrate that nutrient elevation can alter the natural phenology of turfs, sustaining dense covers throughout periods of natural senescence (winter). Perennial turf covers are able to accumulate large volumes of sediment; a synergy can impede the winter recruitment of canopy-forming species (kelps and fucoid algae). My observations of reduced forest recovery along urban coasts serve to highlight the complex interaction between elevated nutrients, persistent turf covers and increased sediment accumulation, which can reduce the resilience of coastal ecosystems to disturbance. In recognition that regime shifts are likely to have consequences for higher trophic levels, I compared the diet of invertebrate herbivores from healthy and degraded coastlines using stable isotope analysis (&#948;&#185;&#179;C and &#948;&#185;&#8309;N). Dietary modelling showed that turfs contributed more to the diet of consumers along degraded coastlines where turfed landscapes have replaced extensive covers of macroalgal forest. Additionally, there were strong correlations between covers of turfed habitat, herbivore diet and relative densities. Changes to ambient food quality associated with regime shift may be an important aspect of nutrient-driven change along human-dominated coastlines. The final component of my thesis redressed some of the uncertainty about restoration initiatives for urban coasts by demonstrating that regime shifts are not necessarily permanent. I showed that turf removal can facilitate the recovery of degraded forests. Future restoration, therefore, is a possible outcome of polices that aim to decouple the link between nutrient inputs and recalcitrant turfed habitats that prevent forest recovery. Initiatives that reduce nutrient discharge to coastal waters (e.g., wastewater recycling) are likely to restore the resilience of nearshore marine ecosystems and promote their rehabilitation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine ecology Australia.</field><field name="subject">Aquatic ecology Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">E-Ludic Learning for Low ICT-Aware Areas :an Experiment in Tepeaca, Puebla, Mexico</field><field name="creator">Dominguez, Luis Carlos</field><field name="description">While researchers in the developed world have focused on the benefits of incorporating engaging forms of ICT (such as games) into education, comparatively little research has been done on the impact of ICT in no-access regions.

The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymerisation and export of alginate in Pseudomanas aeruginosa : functional assignment and catalytic mechanism of Alg8/44 : a thesis presented to Massey University in partial fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Microbiology</field><field name="creator">Remminghorst, Uwe</field><field name="description">Alginate biosynthesis is not only a major contributor to pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa but also an important factor in colonization of adverse environmental habitats by biofilm formation. The requirement of proteins Alg8 and Alg44, encoded by their respective genes in the alginate biosynthesis gene cluster, for alginate biosynthesis of P. aeruginosa was demonstrated, since deletion mutants were unable to produce or polymerise alginate. AlgX deletion mutants failed to produce the alginate characteristic mucoid phenotype, but showed low concentrations of uronic acid monomers in the culture supernatants. Complementation experiments using PCR based approaches were used to determine the complementing ORF and all deletion mutants could be complemented to at least wildtype levels by introducing a plasmid harbouring the respective gene. Increased copy numbers of Alg44 did not impact on the amount of alginate produced, whereas increased copy numbers of the alg8 gene led to an at least 10 fold stronger alginate production impacting on biofilm structure and stability. Topological analysis using reporter protein fusions and subsequent subcellular fractionation experiments revealed that Alg8 is located in the cytoplasmic membrane and contains at least 4 transmembrane helices, 3 of them at its C terminus. Its large cytosolic loop showed similarities to inverting glycosyltransferases and the similarities were used to generate a threading model using SpsA, a glycosyltransferase involved in spore coat formation of B. subtilis, as a template. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the importance of identified motifs commonly detected in glycosyltransferases. Inactivation of the DXD motif, which has been shown to be involved in nucleotide sugar binding, led to loss-offunction mutants of Alg8 and further replacements revealed putative candidates for the catalytic residue(s). Contradicting the commonly reported prediction of being a transmembrane protein, Alg44 was shown to be a periplasmic protein. The highest specific alkaline phosphatase activity of its fusion protein could be detected in the periplasmic fraction and not in the insoluble membrane fraction. Bioinformatical analysis of Alg44 revealed structural similarities of its N terminus to PilZ domains, shown to bind cyclic-di-GMP, and of its C terminus to MexA, a membrane fusion protein involved in multi-drug efflux systems. Thus, it was suggested that Alg44 has a regulatory role for alginate biosynthesis in bridging the periplasm and connecting outer and cytoplasmic membrane components. AlgX was shown to interact with MucD, a periplasmic serine protease or chaperone homologue, and is suggested to exert its impact on alginate production via MucD interaction. In vitro alginate polymerisation assays revealed that alginate production requires protein components of the outer and cytoplasmic membrane as well as the periplasm, and these data were used to construct a model describing a multi-enzyme, membrane and periplasm spanning complex for alginate polymerisation, modification and export.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pseudomonas aeruginosa</field><field name="subject">alginates</field><field name="subject">biosynthesis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270300 Microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Who talks, what they talk about, and how much they say : a study of bulletin structure and source use in New Zealand free-to-air television news programmes : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Management in Communication Management, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Julie Susan</field><field name="description">Free-to-air television news is an accessible and popular means through which audiences can gain knowledge and understanding about the world. Therefore, the nature of the news provided has important implications for the opportunities audiences have to become informed about events and issues, and to use this knowledge to participate in social decision-making. The structure and content of news bulletins reflect the decisions made by broadcasters about the topics that are considered to be important, and which sources should have the opportunity to be represented. Thus, the goal of this research was to compare the structure and content of the news provided by New Zealand&#8217;s national free-to-air news programmes; ONE News (TVNZ), 3 News (TV3), Prime News (Prime Television), and Te K ea (M ori Television). A content analysis of one constructed week of the four news programmes was undertaken, focusing on four general areas of interest. First, the profile of the news bulletins was examined (i.e., the proportion of the bulletin allocated to different segments of the news, the duration of main news stories, the origin of production of main news stories, the proportion of New Zealand and international news, and the topics included in the news). Second, the research investigated the identity of the types of sources selected by the broadcasters for inclusion in locally produced main news stories. Third, the frequency and duration of &#233;lite and non-&#233;lite source speech was examined. Finally, the extent to which journalists speak on camera in news stories was also investigated. The study showed that the four programmes generally conformed to the &#8216;standard profile&#8217; of modern television news bulletins; the programmes included considerable amounts of non-news content and the news topics often reflected entertainment values, rather than focusing on serious issues. A further significant characteristic of the bulletins was that &#233;lite sources were more likely to be included in news stories on all programmes and generally had greater opportunities to speak. However, in many respects it appears that Te K ea provides an alternative news bulletin compared to the other three channels, by focusing on a wider range of news topics, including more non-&#233;lite sources in stories, and giving all sources considerably more time to share their views. Te K ea seems to broadcast a news programme that makes a compromise between the entertainment values which are entrenched in contemporary television news, and the broader M ori Television mandate to inform and educate the public. This contrasts with the more homogenous (in terms of the characteristics examined in this research) news programmes offered by the ONE News, 3 News, and Prime News. This study concludes that the nationally available free-to-air news programmes currently broadcast on New Zealand television fulfil the traditional news functions of informing and educating the public in only a very narrow sense. The deregulated news environment is poised to undergo further transformation with an anticipated increase in convergence among news media and the emergence of more television news providers. The challenge within this commercial environment is for ONE News, 3 News, Prime News, and Te K ea to deliver on their stated commitments to provide information and promote debate on the important issues of the day.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">news bulletins</field><field name="subject">journalism</field><field name="subject">public broadcasting</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organic agriculture: an empowering development strategy for small-scale farmers? A Cambodian case study : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Philosophy in Development Studies at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Beban, Alice</field><field name="description">This thesis explores claims that organic agriculture may be an empowering development strategy by investigating the impacts of conversion to organic farming systems on the lives of small-scale farmers in Cambodia. The thesis interrogates the diverse uses and abuses of the term =empowerment&#8216; in development rhetoric and argues for an empowerment model that is derived from farmers&#8216; self-defined concepts of development. This model was used to conduct a qualitative case study involving semistructured interviews and focus groups with members of organics initiatives in seven diverse Cambodian communities. Results indicate that many farmers in all communities felt that their most important objective was not only to achieve food security, but to be able to grow sufficient rice to feed their family. Farmers joined the organics initiatives primarily to improve their health and reduce the cost of farming inputs. As a result of joining the initiatives, all farmers (including both certified and non-certified organic farmers) felt they had improved their health and food security. Most farmers also increased incomes, created stronger family and community ties and felt they had more control over their livelihoods. These benefits were not, however, distributed equally amongst individuals or communities. Very poor and isolated farmers could not generally access benefits. The three main factors that determined the impact of the organics initiatives on farmer empowerment were identified as: the individual&#8216;s level of resources, the strength of the farmer group, and the policies and values of the supporting organisation. The implications for future initiatives are, firstly, the tremendous potential for farmers and wider rural communities to benefit from organic agriculture as a development strategy. However, this study also shows that if organics is to be viable for low-resource people, it may be necessary to promote both resources and techniques in organics initiatives. Also, a focus on building strong relationships both within the farmers group and linkages with local and wider stakeholders may enhance long-term sustainability of organics initiatives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">organic farming</field><field name="subject">empowerment</field><field name="subject">development strategy</field><field name="subject">development initiatives</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340213 Economic development and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rheo-NMR studies of macromolecules : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Physics at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kakubayashi, Motoko</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the effects of simple shear flow on macromolecular structure and interactions are investigated in detail via a combination of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and rheology, namely Rheo-NMR. A specially designed NMR couette shear cell and benchtop shear cell, developed in-house, demonstrated that the direct measurement of the above phenomena is possible. First, to determine whether the shear cells were creating simple shear flow, results were reproduced from literature studies of liquid crystal systems which report shear effects on: Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide (CTAB) in deuterium oxide, and Poly(gamma-benzyl-L-glutamate) (PBLG) in m-cresol. Next, the possible conformational changes to protein structure brought about by shear were investigated by applying shear to Bovine  -lactogobulin ( -Lg). As the protein was sheared, a small, irreversible conformational change was observed by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional 1H NMR with reasonable reproducibility. However, no observable change was detected by means of light scattering. A large conformational change was observed after shearing a destabilized  -Lg sample containing 10% Trifluoroethanol (TFE) (v/v). From an NMR point of view, the sheared state was similar to the structure of  -Lg containing large amounts of  -helices and, interestingly, similar to the structure of  -Lg containing  -sheet amyloid fibrils. Gel electrophoresis tests suggested that the changes were caused by hydrophobic interactions. Unfortunately, this proved to be difficult to reproduce. The effect of shear on an inter-macromolecular interaction was investigated by applying shear during an enzyme reaction of pectin methylesterase (PME) on pectin. Experimental method and analysis developments are described in detail. It was observed that under the conditions studied, shear does not interfere with the de-esterification of pectin with two types of PME, which have different action mechanisms at average shear rates up to 1570 s-1.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">macromolecular structure</field><field name="subject">shear</field><field name="subject">pectin</field><field name="subject">protein interactions</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240301 Atomic and molecular physics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthelmintic treatment and digestive organ morphology of captive-reared kaki (Himantopus novaezelandiae) released to the wild : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Conservation Biology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Robertson, Louise Mary</field><field name="description">The continued existence of New Zealand&#8217;s critically endangered and endemic black stilt or kak&#239; (Himantopus novaezelandiae) relies on an intensive captive management programme. While this is successful at rearing large numbers of birds for release to the wild, poor survivability of these birds is limiting significant increases in the wild population. Predation and starvation are suspected to be the most common causes of death in released birds, but underlying contributing factors to these mortalities have not been fully evaluated. This research investigates the possible contribution of gastrointestinal (GI) helminth burdens and suboptimal digestive organ development to the high mortality rates of released kak&#239;. Emphasis is placed on evaluating the methods used to assess the importance of these factors and to make informed recommendations for future management. The efficacy of the anthelmintic regime used for kak&#239; was assessed by dosing half of the 80 captive birds with praziquantel (PZQ) prior to release in 2007. Faecal samples were collected before and after anthelmintic treatment, and before and after release to the wild. Post mortem worm counts were conducted on 11 birds that died following release and historical worm count records dating back to 1997 were accessed. The main findings were: PZQ had high efficacy against trematodes; treatment did not prevent re-infection; birds were exposed to helminths at release site; and there was no advantage of treatment for survival. Overall, the results suggest that anthelmintic treatment is an unnecessary cost. Consequently, recommendations were made to cease anthelmintic treatment or reduce its intensity, continue health screening, and incorporate annual efficacy testing to monitor the emergence of anthelmintic resistance. The reliability of faecal screening for GI helminths was evaluated. Faecal egg counts (FECs) were found to be poor indicators of worm burden. The two modified sedimentation methods used to detect trematodes provided relatively low egg recovery rates. Trematode egg shedding varied between days but not by hour of the day or temperature. The collection and analysis of pooled faecal samples proved to be more cost and time-effective than samples from individual birds and the larger masses collected resulted in greater sensitivity. In conclusion, faecal analysis of pooled samples is a useful qualitative indicator of helminth presence or absence but is quantitatively unreliable. In order to assess the importance of digestive organ development to captive-reared and released kak?, the digestive organs of healthy and emaciated captive, released and wild Himantopus sp. were compared. Captive and released kak? had generally smaller digestive organs than wild birds, released birds did not increase digestive organ size to match the high fibre wild diet, and emaciated birds did not have atrophied organs. However, the greatest mortality rates occur soon after release, while the birds were still being supplementary fed. These results suggest that reduced digestive efficiency is probably not contributing significantly to mortality rates and the direct impacts of the translocation are probably greater risk factors. The continued provision of supplementary food to released birds and an increased focus on habitat enhancement and predator control at release sites were recommended. The reliability of comparing fresh and formalin fixed Himantopus sp. gut specimens was evaluated. Significant differences in fresh and formalin fixed organ dry masses and variation in preserved organ lengths indicate that this variation should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, current management practices appear to be successful in ensuring that GI helminths and reduced digestive efficiency do not significantly lower the survivorship of captive-reared and released kak&#239;. There is a need for further research into developing a more direct physiological assessment of the impacts of GI helminths and gut morphology as well as considering the role that starvation may have on poor survivability.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">black stilt</field><field name="subject">captive management</field><field name="subject">endangered species</field><field name="subject">gastrointestinal helminth</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science::300805 Conservation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electroencephalographic responses of calves to the noxious sensory input of slaughter by ventral neck incision and its modulation with non-penetrative captive bolt stunning : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Physiology, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Gibson, Troy John</field><field name="description">Slaughter by ventral neck incision (VNI) is performed on some animals without prior stunning in New Zealand and other countries. A single incision with a razor sharp blade is made in the ventral aspect of the neck, sectioning both carotid arteries and jugular veins, though, not the vertebral arteries. There are a number of potential welfare concerns surrounding slaughter by VNI including pain due to the incision, which may lead to distress during the time before loss of consciousness. The aims of this thesis were to identify cortical responses indicative of noxious stimulation due to slaughter by VNI using analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectrum and to investigate the effects of non-penetrative captive bolt (NPCB) stunning on these cortical responses. The studies utilised adaptations of a minimal anaesthesia model, which has been validated in a range of mammalian species. Surgical dehorning was used as a validation technique for this methodology in cattle and demonstrated a &#8216;typical&#8217; EEG response to noxious stimulation. Cattle slaughtered by VNI without prior stunning produced specific responses in the EEG that strongly indicated responses to noxious stimulation. Causation was investigated in cattle where blood flow through the brain remained intact during neck tissue incision (NTI) or the major blood vessels of the neck were isolated and transected independently of other neck tissues (BVT). The response to neck incision in intact animals was principally due to the noxious sensory input due to incision of neck tissues and not mainly as a result of loss of blood flow through the brain. NPCB stunning produced states of cortical activity that were incompatible with the maintenance of sensibility and pain perception. Experimental examination of the time to onset of undoubted insensibility was attempted in cattle subsequent to a pilot study in sheep. The generation of somatosensory-evoked potentials was problematic in cattle. The conclusions of this thesis are that incision of neck tissues during slaughter without prior stunning constitutes a substantial noxious stimulus. Were an animal conscious, this stimulus would be perceived as painful until the onset of hypoxiainduced insensibility. This would represent a significant compromise to animal welfare.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">animal stress</field><field name="subject">cattle slaughter</field><field name="subject">cortical response</field><field name="subject">pain perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300500 Veterinary Medicine::300505 Anatomy and physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Youth development, Maui styles : Kia tipu te rito o te pa harakeke, Tikanga and ahuatanga as a basis for a positive Maori youth development approach : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts in Maori Studies at Te Kunenga ki Purehuroa Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ware, Felicity Jane Rachel</field><field name="description">The Youth Development Strategy Aotearoa has been seen as an innovative approach to youth development. The E tipu e rea &#8211; Rangatahi Development Package was particularly useful for organisations implementing the strategy with Maori youth. There have been successful Maori youth development initiatives, though these have been ad hoc. Nonetheless, the realities and experiences of Maori youth are still not being fully addressed in national policy. This has implications for the support and resourcing of Maori youth development initiatives. Maori youth are members of a range of groups including whanau, hapu, iwi and Maori communities in te ao Maori as well as the wider youth population and New Zealand society. The histories, experiences and viewpoints of each distinct group contribute to diversity in the Maori youth population which presents challenges for Maori youth development. Maori development goals do not adequately focus on Maori youth and youth development theory does not fully consider culture. The challenge is to successfully integrate Maori culture and youth culture in a relevant and meaningful manner so that Maori youth can positively contribute to Maori development and wider New Zealand society. This study examines purakau (narratives) about Maui (Polynesian ancestor) as a template for the analysis of Maori youth development. Interviews were undertaken with a group of Maori youth from the Manawatu region. The research showed tikanga and ahuatanga were relevant to the contemporary daily lives of the participants.

The concern over GM and the political situation after the 1999 general election saw the Government establish a Royal Commission of Inquiry on Genetic Modification in May, 2000. The Royal Commission and strong public opposition to GM, evident in large public protests and other actions, made the issue highly newsworthy. The aim of this study was to explore how newspapers reported the GM debate, in particular, examining whether the reportage facilitated greater public debate and awareness about GM through journalists adhering to the ideals of the theory of social responsibility and enacting their watchdog role as encapsulated in the Fourth Estate tradition of the media. To achieve these aims the overall tone of the reportage and also which news source types and themes were most frequently reported were examined. In addition, the relationship and perceptions of scientists and journalists involved in the reporting were explored to examine how these relationships may have influenced the reportage. Content analysis showed the reportage had a pro-GM bias with policy-makers, scientists and industry spokespeople the most frequently cited news sources. The themes of Science, Economics and Politics dominated the reportage. Other source types and themes were less represented, especially themes dealing with ethical and environmental arguments. This lack of representation occurred despite the Royal Commission offering a space for all interested parties to speak. The interviews illustrated that scientists believed the quality of newspaper coverage of GM lacked depth and that important issues were unreported. Journalists found the issue complex to report and said they took care not to oversimplify the science and issues surrounding GM. The relationship between scientists and journalists indicated particular tensions existing between the two groups. The thesis concludes that if robust public debate is to occur within New Zealand regarding GM and other scientific developments, then the media should reflect a greater diversity of opinion by citing other potential news sources offering alternative arguments based on, for example, ethical or environmental grounds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">journalism viewpoints</field><field name="subject">newspaper report evaluation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::289900 Other Information, Computing and Communication Sciences ::289999 Other information, computing and communication sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Social Construction of Sexual Practice: Setting Sexual Culture and the Body in Casual Sex Between Men</field><field name="creator">Richters, Juliet</field><field name="description">Human sexual behaviour is highly variable and not tightly linked to biological reproduction. However, it has not been studied as social behaviour until the last 40 years and until recently it is largely deviant behaviour that has gained the attention of sociologists. Sociology has adopted an unnecessarily antibiologistic position and consequently neglected the body. In reviewing sociological approaches to sex I draw on social constructionism, particularly the work of Gagnon and Simon (1974) and their notion of scripts; these can be interpreted as discursive structures defining sexual acts and sexual actors at both the individual and societal level. I outline a range of social constructionist positions in relation to sexuality and adopt a moderately radical but realist one that concedes some place for the physiology of arousal linking the elements of the discursive realm of the sexual in social life. Finding the basic assumptions of symbolic interactionism a fruitful base from which to approach sexual conduct I reject the concept of 'desire' as too complex and obscure to serve as a starting point in understanding the social organisation of sex.    A review of the ethnographic observational studies of settings in which men have casual sex shows that beats (public places such as parks and toilets) operate in a similar manner in many countries. Commercial sex venues are more varied. They are safer and more comfortable than beats and may offer private rooms and facilities for esoteric sex such as bondage. Sex in such settings is impersonal and anonymous, costs little effort, time or money, and offers a variety of partners. Interaction is largely nonverbal. Interview studies of men who have casual sex with other men tend to undersample men who are not gay-identified, but they offer insights into men's motivations and understandings. Both kinds of research are necessary.   The empirical component of the thesis is a thematic analysis of transcripts from three interview studies of gay men in Sydney done between 1993 and 1997: Negotiating Sex (n = 9), the Sites study (n = 21) and the Seroconversion study (n = 70). All involved detailed narratives of sexual encounters. The analysis takes a situational interactionist approach with a specific focus on practice. Central questions asked are:   how does the setting (beat, sex venue, home) affect what happens? What does sex mean to the men, and how does this affect what they do? How do men's sexual skills, tastes and experience relate to their practice? How do men's bodies and their understandings of the body affect their practice? What do different sexual practices mean and how are they organised and negotiated within the encounter? How (if at all) do men integrate considerations of safe sex into their practice?   Physical surroundings were found to have a profound effect on practice. Sex venues as cultural institutions enable patterns of practice that do not occur elsewhere. Physical arrangements within beats and venues encourage or enable particular practices, such as oral sex or group sex.   Motivations for and meanings of sex to the participants varied widely; these were related to practice within the men's own accounts but not in any clear predictive way. Men's sexual skills, tastes and preferences, which were also very varied, related to their practice. Men made trade-offs between risk and pleasure. Men looked for a range of features in casual partners. Suppression of social cues restricted the range of criteria on which partners were selected, enabling wider choice.    Men's bodies affected their practice most strikingly in the issue of erection or the lack of it. Understandings of the body and physiological processes affected men's interpretations of information about HIV risk.   These men have a vocabulary of sexual practices within which some common practices are less salient. These practices are socially patterned in ways that benefit men with certain tastes and abilities and frustrate those with others. Safe sex considerations are routinely integrated into sexual practice but in a way that leaves room for considerable risk of HIV transmission.   In conclusion I argue that conceptualising sex between men exclusively in terms of gay identity and culture is inappropriate. The outcome of the empirical work confirms the theoretical analysis that found it necessary to incorporate some physiological notions, such as 'libido', into a social constructionist view of sex. The findings and their interpretations have important implications for framing effective HIV prevention programs. Some specific suggestions are made for how this might be done.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sexual practice;social constructionism;male homosexuality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding Students Learning Statistics:  An Activity Theory Approach</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Susan Eve</field><field name="description">In this project I investigate university students orientations to learning statistics. The students who participated in my research  were studying statistics as a compulsory component of their psychology course. My central thesis is that learning develops in the  relationship between the thinking, feeling and acting person and the social, institutional and cultural contexts surrounding him or  her. How students orient themselves or position themselves to learn statistics is reflected in their engagement with the learning task  and their activities. These activities determine the quality of their learning and emerging knowledge. To understand student learning I  draw on the powerful theories of Vygotsky (1962, 1978) and Leontev (1978, 1981). In particular, I extend and apply Leontev's  construct of activity (Leontev, 1981). This suggests that individuals act in accordance with their purposes and needs which are  shaped by and reflect histories and resources, both personal and cultural.     My investigation consists of two studies. Study One is a qualitative exploration of the orientations to learning statistics of five older  students. These students sought help with statistics at the Mathematics Learning Centre where I work. My case studies of these  students are inseparable from my efforts to help them learn statistics. Study Two is grounded in Study One. The main source of  data for this broader study is a survey which was completed by 279 psychology students studying statistics. In keeping with the  theoretical framework, my methodology involves a holistic analysis of students and the milieu in which they act. My findings  suggest relationships among students affective appraisals; their conceptions of statistics; their approaches to learning it; their  evaluations and the outcomes of their actions. In Study One the relationships emerged from the students' descriptions. In Study  Two I quantified the ways in which variables related to each other. Structure for the data was provided by means of correlations,  factor analysis and cluster analysis. For this study I also interviewed students and teachers of statistics. My data support the  systemic view of teaching and learning in context afforded by my theoretical perspective. Learning statistics involves the whole  person (Semenov, 1978) and is inseparable from the arena of his or her actions.     The goal of statistics education is surely to enable students to develop useful, meaningful knowledge. My findings suggest that for  many of the participants in my project this goal was not being met. Most of these students reported their reluctance to learn statistics  and described adopting primarily surface approaches to learning it. A range of conceptions of the subject was expressed, but for  many of the students statistical meaning was evidently reduced to performance on assessment tasks. Such orientations to learning  statistics may lead to it becoming irrelevant and inert information. For a few students, however, the experience of learning statistics  led to self development and enhanced perspectives on the world in which we live. My project indicates the diversity of students'  experiences. It raises issues as to why we teach statistics today and how the teaching and learning of statistics is being supported at  university.         //REFERENCES    Leontev, A. N. (1978).

Therefore the maternal musculoskeletal system is required to adapt in both morphology and functional workload. After childbirth there is a rapid change in both mass and dimensions, requiring further adaptations. The objectives of the study were to investigate seated and standing upper body posture, the kinematics of seated and standing trunk motion, and the three dimensional kinematics and kinetics during rising to stand from a chair, as pregnancy progressed and in the early post-birth period.   Nine maternal subjects (aged 28 to 40 years) were tested at less than 16 weeks, 24 weeks, 30 weeks, 38 weeks gestation and at 8 weeks postbirth. The subjects, fitted with 37 retroreflective markers, were filmed during upright sitting, quiet standing, and four trials each of maximum seated and standing trunk forward flexion, side to side flexion and during maximum seated axial rotation. Three trials each of constrained and free rising to stand from a height adjustable stool and with each foot placed on a forceplate were also recorded. An eight-camera motion analysis system was used to record movements of the body segments and synchronised force plate variables in three dimensions. Motion of the ankle, knee and hip joints, pelvic, thoracic and head segments and the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spines and shoulder joints were investigated. Twelve nulliparous subjects (aged 21 to 35 years) were used as controls to provide standard descriptive data and to investigate the consistency of the selected biomechanical variables with repeated testing. A repeated measures ANOVA was used to investigate the possibility of linear and quadratic trends showing systematic changes within the maternal group, over the four test sessions during pregnancy for each variable. Two tailed Student t-tests were used to compare the maternal postbirth variable results with the control group.  There was no significant effect of pregnancy on the upper body posture during upright sitting and quiet standing. Postbirth, the pelvic segment had a smaller anterior orientation and the thoracolumbar spine was less extended, indicating a flatter spinal curve.  The maternal subjects were similar to the control subjects in early pregnancy and postbirth for trunk segment motions during seated and standing forward flexion and side to side flexion and seated axial rotation. Strategies, such as increasing the width of the base of support and reducing obstruction to movements from other body parts, were used in late pregnancy in attempts to minimise the effects of increased trunk mass and circumference. For seated and standing side to side flexion, the strategies were successful and no significant decreases in range of motion were seen. For seated and standing forward flexion and seated axial rotation, motion of the thoracic segment and the thoracolumbar spine were significantly reduced, although movement of the pelvis was less affected.   In early pregnancy and postbirth the kinematics and kinetics of the lower limbs and upper body segment kinematics during constrained and free rising were generally similar to the control subjects. As pregnancy progressed there were increases in mass and dimensions of body segments. The effect of increased mass was seen in increased ground reaction forces and sagittal plane lower limb joint external moments. An increased base of support width was found in association with an increased lateral ground reaction force and ankle inversion moment from each foot, which would move the body centre of mass medially. There was little change in the three dimensional kinematics of the thoracolumbar and cervicothoracic spine, although the contribution of the upper body segments differed for each rise condition. There were also few significant changes in the displacement of the ankle, knee and hip, and the angular velocity of ankle and knee joints. The maternal subjects were thus able to flex the upper body forward, raise the body and maintain stability as pregnancy progressed, regardless of whether the rise to stand was performed in a natural manner or under constrained conditions. The overall results show that, contrary to expectations as pregnancy progressed, maternal subjects minimised propulsion rather than increasing it to overcome the increased mass and possibly limited trunk flexion. A fear of postural instability may have made the subjects more cautious and as they were able to adequately flex the trunk forward, propulsion was minimised in favour of maintaining upright terminal balance.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pregnancy;biomechanics;posture;sit to stand;spinal motion;kinematics;kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Pilot Survey to Assess the Vitamin A Status of Children Aged 6-72 months in the Ramu Region of Papua New Guinea</field><field name="creator">Verma, Nitin</field><field name="description">Papua New Guinea has been classified by the World Health Organisation as an area where clinical vitamin A deficiency (VAD) exists. This is at variance with the experience of the local physicians who do not encounter classical VAD in clinical practice.   This pilot study was carried out to resolve this contradiction, since many suggestions have been made to fortify foods with Vitamin A. If done in the absence of concrete data to back up this classification, it could take the focus away from the real problem as well as potentially create problems of Vitamin A toxicity. Therefore, answers from this study could have far reaching implications in a country such as PNG, which has high childhood mortality and limited financial and manpower resources.     The objective of this study was to determine the vitamin A status and identify risk factors of VAD in children aged 6 months to 6 years in a rural area of Papua New Guinea.     The survey was carried out in the Ramu region of Madang province. Households and children were randomly selected and standard questionnaires were used to collect information about diet, previous illnesses and night blindness. The weight and height of all children was recorded and an ocular and physical examination carried out by trained personnel. In addition, haemoglobin estimation and examination of blood films for malaria parasites was carried out in all the children.  In a randomly selected number of children, estimations of serum retinol and other micronutrient levels were carried out.  Results: A total of 609 children were enrolled in the study. Biochemical parameters were studied in 106 of them .The mean age of the children was 35 months. Possible night blindness was reported in 4 children. No xerophthalmia was seen. The prevalence of serum retinol levels ( 0.7 (mol/L (WHO suggested cut off values for subclinical VAD) was 10.3%. Anthropometric indicators indicated a high proportion of the children had stunting and wasting or both. Analysis of dietary patterns, maternal literacy, food availability and other surrogate indicators indicated that the population is at mild-moderate risk of developing VAD.  In conclusion, no evidence of clinical vitamin A deficiency was found. Subclinical vitamin A deficiency seemed to occur in this population at a level of mild-moderate public health importance. Further studies need to be carried out to assess the situation in different areas in PNG before policy decisions can be made with regards to mass vitamin A supplementation.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vitamin A;children;Papua New Guinea;vitamin A deficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedagogy and Parenting in English Drama, 1560-1610:  Flogging Schoolmasters and Cockering Mothers</field><field name="creator">Potter, Ursula Ann</field><field name="description">In this thesis I examine the representation of parents and schoolmasters and the conflicts between them in vernacular drama in Reformation England.  This was a period of growth in public schooling and a time when numerous treatises on education and childrearing were in circulation in England.  Prevailing pedagogical theory privileged the schoolmaster's authority over that of the parents, and set paternal authority over that of the mother.  It sought to limit maternal power to the domestic sphere and the infant years, yet the drama examined here suggests that mothers, not fathers, were usually the parent in control of their children's education.  The conflicts inherent in these oppositions are played out in drama dealing with schooling and childrearing; each of the works examined here participates in and contributes to public debate over school education and parenting practices in early modern England.  The thesis conducts a close textual and contextual analysis of the representation of schoolmasters and parents and of parent-school relations in seven English plays.  A variety of dramatic genres is represented: public drama (Love's Labour's Lost, Patient Grissill, The Winter's Tale), school drama (Nice Wanton, July and Julian, The Disobedient Child), and private royal entertainment (The Lady of May).  The plays are explicated in terms of the Tudor school culture and the negotiation of authority between fathers, mothers and schoolmasters.  The thesis draws extensively on sixteenth-century school dialogues and vulgaria and on education treatises, which were available in English in Tudor England, in particular the writings of Erasmus, Vives, Ascham, Mulcaster, Elyot, Brinsley and Becon.  School records provide information on school conditions and curricula, the duties and qualities of schoolmasters and the role of schools in civic and public performances.  The thesis addresses issues of gender, childrearing, public education and parental and pedagogical authority in the second half of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedagogy;schooling;education;schoolmasters;humanism;childrearing;parenting;mothers;fathers;Shakespeare;Renaissance drama</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rotational Motion Artifact Correction in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</field><field name="creator">Weerasinghe, Arachchige Chaminda Perera</field><field name="description">The body motion of patients, during magnetic resonance (MR) imaging causes     significant artifacts in the reconstructed image. Artifacts are manifested as a motion induced blur and ghost repetitions of the moving structures. which obscure vital anatomical and pathological detail. The techniques that have been    proposed for suppressing motion artifacts fall into two major categories. Real-time techniques attempt to prevent the motion from corrupting the data by   restricting the data acquisition times or motion of the patients, whereas the    post-processing techniques use the information embedded in the corrupted data    to restore the image. Most methods currently in widespread use belong to the    real-time techniques, however with the advent of fast computing platforms and    sophisticated signal processing algorithms, the emergence of post-processing techniques is clearly evident.            The post-processing techniques usually demand an appropriate model of the      motion. The restoration of the image requires that the motion parameters be      determined in order to invert the data degradation process. Methods for the      correction of translational motion have been studied extensively in the past. The subject of this thesis encompasses the rotational motion model and the effect of rotational motion on the collected MR data in the spatial frequency space (k-space), which is in general, more complicated than the translational model.            Rotational motion artifacts are notably prevalent in MR images of head, brain and limbs. Post-processing techniques for the correction of rotational motion artifacts often involve interpolation and re-gridding of the acquired data in the k-space. These methods create significant data overlap and void regions. Therefore, in the past, proposed corrective techniques have been limited to suppression of artifacts caused by small angle rotations. This thesis presents a method of managing overlap regions, using weighted averaging of redundant data, in order to correct for large angle rotations. An iterative estimation technique for filling the data void regions has also been developed by the use of iterated application of projection operators onto constraint sets. These constraint sets are derived from the k-space data generated by the MR imager, and available a priori knowledge.             It is shown that the iterative algorithm diverges at times from the required image, due to inconsistency among the constraint sets. It is also shown that this can be overcome by using soft. constraint sets and fuzzy projections.            One of the constraints applied in the iterative algorithm is the finite support of the imaged object, marked by the outer boundary of the region of interest (ROI).      However, object boundary extraction directly from the motion affected MR image can be difficult, specially if the motion function of the object is unknown. This thesis presents a new ROI extraction scheme based on entropy minimization in the image background.            The object rotation function is usually unknown or unable to be measured with sufficient accuracy. The motion estimation algorithm proposed in this thesis is based on maximizing the similarity among the k-space data subjected to angular overlap. This method is different to the typically applied parameter estimation technique based on minimization of pixel energy outside the ROI, and has higher efficiency and ability to estimate rotational motion parameters in the midst of concurrent translational motion. The algorithms for ROI extraction, rotation estimation and data correction have been tested with both phantom images and spin echo MR images producing encouraging results.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">magnetic resonance imaging;MRI;POCS;fuzzy POCS;fuzzy sets;ROI;signal estimation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Radio Study of Selected Regions in the   Magellanic Clouds</field><field name="creator">Amy, Shaun Wallace</field><field name="description">The Magellanic Clouds have long provided a rich celestial laboratory for many   astrophysical research programmes.  Their location relatively close to the  Earth and away from the plane of our Galaxy has made them a natural target   for Southern Hemisphere ground-based instrumentation.  Likewise, the   continuing quest for images of the Clouds with higher dynamic range and   improved angular resolution has driven a continual improvement in   instrumentation across a range of wavelength bands.    The cornerstone of this thesis is a study of selected sources in the  Magellanic Clouds.  The sample was chosen from the 843MHz Molonglo   Observatory Synthesis Telescope survey of the Clouds, based on the existing  knowledge of each source, its flux density and angular extent.  This sample was   used to explore observational and analysis techniques with the Australia  Telescope Compact Array in order to better determine the nature of these   objects and to identify those sources worthy of further study.  This work  highlights many pertinent issues associated with the correct classification of  sources when only a limited amount of data is available.  These issues led  directly to the development of a more systematic approach in the   classification of the Large Magellanic Cloud source sample, detailed for the  first time in this thesis.     Two supernova remnants in the Small Magellanic Cloud were studied in detail.    The Australia Telescope images of 1E0102.2-7219 revealed, for the first   time, the radio structure of this young oxygen-rich supernova remnant, and   allowed a detailed comparison with existing optical and X-ray data to be  undertaken.  The comparisons presented in this thesis and in an earlier  publication have prompted exciting new X-ray observations at unprecedented  angular resolution.  The second, 0101-7226, studied as part of an   international collaboration, has a shell morphology at radio wavelengths   but no associated X-ray emission and is therefore something of an enigma.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radio Astronomy;Magellanic Clouds;Aperture Synthesis Imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative Studies on Plasma Vitamin D Binding Protein</field><field name="creator">LAING, CHRISTOPHER JAMES</field><field name="description">The plasma vitamin D binding protein (DBP) is an a-glycoprotein, synthesised and secreted by the liver, which binds specifically vitamin D and its metabolites. The DBP molecule, has a single high affinity binding site for its ligands, and is present in blood in concentrations about 1000-fold greater than the sum of all its vitamin D ligands. Previous studies have not found any change in the concentration of DBP related to various derangements in mineral homeostasis. Therefore the general view is that DBP has a passive role in the physiology of vitamin D and its metabolites, and simply acts to solubilise and transport these hydrophobic ligands in the aqueous extracellular fluid. However, differences which have been described in its affinity for various vitamin D metabolites suggest that there have been evolutionary influences on the properties of this protein. Furthermore, plasma DBP concentration has been found to change in response to a number of physiological factors, such as changing sex steroid hormone secretion. The aim of the studies presented in this thesis was to investigate variation in the plasma concentration of the DBP in a range of vertebrate species, and in response to a variety of physiological factors. The results  suggest that DBP may have an active role in regulating the bioavailability, and hence the utilisation and metabolism of its ligands.     DBP concentration has traditionally been measured using immunological techniques. These techniques, although fast and simple, have a number of draw-backs which can be overcome by the use of assays which rely upon functional aspects of the DBP. A saturation binding assay was modified from those described previously. Using this technique, it was found that both the circulating concentration of the DBP and its affinity for 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) varied significantly among a wide range of species of reptiles and birds. This variation did not reflect phylogenetic relationships among the study species, suggesting that the variation was more likely to be the result of selective pressure in response to individual ecological or physiological circumstance, rather than to random mutation. In support of this, both the plasma concentration of DBP, and its affinity for 25(OH)D3 were significantly associated with a number of ecological factors which might be considered to have some significance to vitamin D and calcium homeostasis. In addition, comparative binding data suggests that the ability of the DBP to bind 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 with equal affinity to 25(OH)D3 is an evolutionary innovation of mammalian vertebrates. In order to extend the idea of genetic variation in the concentration and affinity of plasma DBP, two strains of broiler (meat-type) chickens were studied. It was found that both the concentration and the affinity of plasma DBP for 25(OH)D3 was characteristic for each strain, emphasising the sensitivity of DBP to genetic variation.     A number of factors have been found to modulate the genetically determined plasma concentration of DBP. Deficiencies of dietary protein and dietary energy, and variation in concentrations of sex steroids were found to affect the circulating concentration of DBP. However, species differences were still apparent, suggesting that the sensitivity of DBP to these physiological modifiers may have developed independently in different species, and may be secondary to genetic determinants of DBP properties.    The plasma DBP concentration and specific binding affinity both determine the availability of its ligands for cellular uptake. It is likely that this process is complex, and involves a combination of protein mediated and non-mediated uptake events. This makes DBP a potentially important determinant of the biological actions of its ligands. The studies in this thesis have produced two main lines of argument supporting an active role for DBP in the regulation of vitamin D metabolism and utilisation. The first is that genetic variation in the properties of plasma DBP appears to be genetically determined, and is selected for, both at the between-species, and the within-species level, than it is to random mutation. Secondly, the ability of physiological and environmental factors to modify the circulating concentration of DBP suggests that this protein is responsive to homeostatic processes. It is proposed that DBP is an active regulator of the physiological economy of vitamin D and its metabolites by being itself regulated by a number of genetic and non-genetic factors.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vitamin D binding protein;DBP;vitamin D;cholecalciferol</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/359</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lena Ashwell 1869-1957: Actress, Patriot, Pioneer</field><field name="creator">Leask, Margaret Eileen</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT    A detailed account of the working life and achievements of the English actress/manager, Lena Ashwell, between the years 1891 and 1929, set in the context of the theatrical and social environment of these four decades. The thesis presents a chronological record of Ashwell's stage career, her development as a theatrical manager and her contributions to progress in her profession as well as to the changing perception of the role of women in society. It also records Ashwell's contribution during the First World War, taking entertainment to the war zones to boost the morale of soldiers and to provide employment for actors and musicians. It continues with an account of the post-war pursuit of her aim of making theatre accessible to the whole community through dedicated commitment to the British Drama League and the idea of a National Theatre and the creation and management of the Lena Ashwell Players.     The thesis proposes that Ashwell has been unjustly neglected in histories of this period and that her considerable achievements are worthy of recognition and inclusion in accounts not only of the acting profession and the achievements of women playwrights, but also of the Suffrage and women's movement, the First World War, the National Theatre of Great Britain and the municipal or regional theatres established throughout the country, state subsidy and public support for the arts, actor training and the study of drama and theatre within the education system.    Five chapters give a narrative account of Ashwell's work from her first stage appearance in March 1891 to the closure of the Lena Ashwell Players in August 1929. Each chapter adds to the cumulative impact of Ashwell's achievements, while identifying areas where she has left a lasting legacy. The Postscript provides a brief account of the last twenty-seven years of her long life, when she was less able to play an active role in society, but never lost her indomitable spirit or ambition for a better world. The Appendices provide a chronological list of her stage appearances and details of the members of the Lena Ashwell Players and the company's repertoire during the 1920s.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theatre;theatre in education;community theatre;actress;theatre manager</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Participant music listening behaviours in interactive multimedia music instruction</field><field name="creator">Stanley, Michael Brooke</field><field name="description">While emerging technologies such as interactive multimedia are increasingly being employed in computerised music instruction, understanding of participant music listening behaviours in interactive multimedia music instruction is currently very limited. With the aim of elucidating music listening behaviour, the central concern of this work is to identify and explain participant interactions with the audio components of interactive multimedia music instruction. The investigation employs a novel documentation procedure, which extends the application of digital audio recording technology, to provide a finely calibrated analysis of the audio activity of a sample of 20 undergraduate music education majors during individual sessions with two commercially-available interactive multimedia music instruction programs. Graphically-based Sound Activity Profiles, which the researcher developed specifically for the current investigation, characterise and summarise participant interactions with audio components, while an analysis of questionnaire responses and follow-up interview transcripts provides supplementary information that further explains participants' music listening behaviours.  The results of the investigation show that music listening behaviours during the study sessions were highly variable. While extensive participant interaction with music examples occasionally reflected attentive music listening behaviours, many study sessions were characterised by brief, fragmentary music excerpts and lengthy periods of silence. Participants spent as little as five percent of their session time listening to music and as much as 88 percent of the session time in silence. A substantial number of the study cohort frequently interrupted the music examples they had activated. Participants' perceptions of the extent of their interaction with music examples were frequently  inaccurate, as subjects often substantially overestimated the amount of session time they had spent listening to music. The study findings suggest that many interactive multimedia music instruction participants would benefit from interventions that elicit more extensive and prolonged interaction with music examples. Accordingly, recommendations include a call for research to develop and test software designs that incorporate automated monitoring of session audio activity so that dynamic on-screen information about music listening behaviour can be provided to interactive multimedia music instruction participants. Such information may encourage participants to modify inappropriate music listening behaviours.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">music;listening;behaviours;interactive;multimedia;instruction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Seismic Applications of Interactive Computational Methods</field><field name="creator">LI, MIN</field><field name="description">Effective interactive computing methods are needed in a number of specific areas of geophysical interpretation, even though the basic algorithms have been established. One approach to raise the quality of interpretation is to promote better interaction between human and the computer. The thesis is concerned with improving this dialog in three areas: automatic event picking, data visualization and sparse data imaging.     Fully automatic seismic event picking methods work well in relatively good conditions. They collapse when the signal-to-noise ratio is low and the structure of the subsurface is complex. The interactive seismic event picking system described here blends the interpreter's guidance and judgment into the computer program, as it can bring the user into the loop to make subjective decisions when the picking problem is complicated. Several interactive approaches for 2-D event picking and 3-D horizon tracking have been developed. Envelope (or amplitude) threshold detection for first break picking is based on the assumption that the power of the signal is larger than that of the noise. Correlation and instantaneous phase pickers are designed for and better suited to picking other arrivals. The former is based on the cross-correlation function, and a model trace (or model traces) selected by the interpreter is needed. The instantaneous phase picker is designed to track spatial variations in the instantaneous phase of the analytic form of the arrival. The picking options implemented into the software package SeisWin were tested on real data drawn from many sources, such as full waveform sonic borehole logs, seismic reflection surveys and borehole radar profiles, as well as seven of the most recent 3-D seismic surveys conducted over Australian coal mines. The results show that the interactive picking system in SeisWin is efficient and tolerant. The 3-D horizon tracking method developed especially attracts industrial users.     The visualization of data is also a part of the study, as picking accuracy, and indeed the whole of seismic interpretation depends largely on the quality of the final display. The display is often the only window through which an interpreter can see the earth's substructures. Display is a non-linear operation. Adjustments made to meet display deficiencies such as automatic gain control (AGC) have an important and yet ill-documented effect on the performance of pattern recognition operators, both human and computational. AGC is usually implemented in one dimension. Some of the tools in wide spread use for two dimensional image processing which are of great value in the local gain control of conventional seismic sections such as edge detectors, histogram equalisers, high-pass filters, shaded relief are discussed. Examples are presented to show the relative effectiveness of various display options.    Conventional migration requires dense arrays with uniform coverage and uniform illumination of targets. There are, however, many instances in which these ideals can not be approached. Event migration and common tangent plane stacking procedures were developed especially for sparse data sets as a part of the research effort underlying this thesis. Picked-event migration migrates the line between any two points on different traces on the time section to the base map. The interplay between the space and time domain gives the interpreter an immediate view of mapping. Tangent plane migration maps the reflector by accumulating the energy from any two possible reflecting points along the common tangent lines on the space plane. These methods have been applied to both seismic and borehole-radar data and satisfactory results have been achieved.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">event picking;horizon tracking;image;sparse data</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social and Psychological Adjustments of First Generation Polish Immigrants to Australia</field><field name="creator">Jancz, Marek Waclaw</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this research was to find predictors of psycho-social adjustment of Polish immigrants to Sydney, Australia. There were two sets of independent variables considered: i) personal characteristics, including: intelligence, extraversion, neuroticism, style of attribution and self-acceptance and  ii) demographic information, consisted of: age, gender, length of residence, marital status, number of children, educational level, yearly income, immigration status (dependent vs. independent immigration) and residential status.      The dependent variables were social (adaptation and assimilation) and psychological adjustment. The hypotheses tested in the study were that each of these personal and demographic characteristics would be associated with adaptation and/or assimilation, and psychological well-being.       The two samples (both studies) were composed of more than 200 first generation Polish immigrants who arrived in Australia after 1980. No significant gender differences were found. The internal consistency and principal components structure of Adaptation and Assimilation were examined, and the measures were refined. There were employed standard measurements (i.e. GHQ, BDI, BAI, EPI, ASQ, Raven Matrices and WAIS-Vocabulary) and newly developed measures (i.e. the Social Adjustment Scale and the Self-Acceptance Questionnaire).       The general results suggested that psycho-social adjustment was best predicted by three pre-arrival characteristics (extraversion, education and self-acceptance), and post-arrival employment status and length of residence. There were, however, some differences in regard to the particular aspects of psycho-social adjustment. Better adaptation was meaningfully related to employment (income) and education in Study 1, and self-acceptance, employment and extraversion in Study 2; better assimilation seemed to be significantly predicted by education, age of arrival and length of residence (Study 1), and self-acceptance, extraversion, education and age of arrival (Study 2). Psychological [mal]adjustment was best indicated by globality and stability in attributing negative events (Study 1), lower self-acceptance and lack of employment status (Study 2).</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Immigration-Adjustments-Heath</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The behavioural and neural effects of cannabinoids:  Studies using Lewis and Wistar strain rats</field><field name="creator">Arnold, Jonathon Carl</field><field name="description">Cannabis (known in its common forms as Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica) is the most widely used illicit drug in the world and has been used for thousands of years for medicinal, religious and hedonistic purposes.  In the last half of the 20th century the therapeutic uses of cannabis were largely ignored as most Western governments prohibited the use of the drug.  Prohibition has come about largely as a result of the view that cannabis is a dangerous drug that poses major risks to both mental and physical health.  However, this view is being increasingly challenged in recent years with a major popular movement towards decriminalization of cannabis occurring in some Western countries and a resurgence of interest in the medicinal properties of cannabis.   Since Mechoulam and colleagues first isolated delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) as the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, considerable advances have been made in the pharmacology of cannabis and cannabis-like drugs (cannabinoids).  Central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors have been isolated and two endogenous ligands have been discovered.  In addition, two cannabinoid receptor antagonists have been developed.  However, our knowledge of the behavioural, neural and emotional effects of cannabis and the cannabinoids has often lagged behind our understanding of basic cannabinoid pharmacology.   The present thesis attempts to further the understanding of the behavioural, neural and emotional effects of cannabinoids, using laboratory rats as subjects.  A synthetic analogue of delta 9-THC (CP 55,940), is used as the primary pharmacological tool.  The thesis offers a broad perspective with three major areas of investigation.  These are:  1) the effects of CP 55,940 on anxiety-related behaviour (Chapters 2 and 3);  2) the effects of CP 55,940 on patterns of brain activation as indicated by c-fos expression (Chapter 4) and;  3) the addictive potential of CP 55,940 and its capacity to produce sensitization to the effects of other drugs such as cocaine (Chapters 5 and 6).  A recurring theme throughout the thesis is that genetic factors may partially determine the behavioural, neural and emotional response to cannabinoids.  To this end, the thesis compares Lewis and Wistar trains of rat in a wide variety of assays.  Previous research has isolated Lewis rats as an "addiction-prone" and a "cannabinoid-preferring" strain, as they are more sensitive to the rewarding effects of various drugs of abuse including cannabinoids.  Conversely, cannabinoids appear to have aversive effects in Wistar rats.  A long-standing puzzle in cannabinoid research has been the question of why rats do not self-administer cannabis or cannabinoids.  One likely reason is that cannabinoids have predominately aversive effects in rats.  It is proposed here that these aversive effects arise because cannabinoids are anxiogenic agents in most rat strains.  However some evidence indicates that the Lewis strain of rat are the only strain to find cannabinoids rewarding.  It is hypothesised that Lewis rats may be more susceptible to the rewarding effects of cannabinoids because they are less susceptible to the anxiogenic effects of these compounds.    In Chapters 2 and 3 the anxiogenic effects of the synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP 55,940 were compared in Lewis and Wistar rats in several different animal models of anxiety.  In Chapter 2, the predatory odour avoidance, open area avoidance and conditioned ultrasonic vocalization (USV) models were utilised.  In the predatory odour avoidance model, rats were exposed to cat odour in a rectangular arena and given the opportunity to hide in a small box.  Both Lewis and Wistar rats displayed high levels of hiding during odour exposure.  In Wistar but not Lewis rats, 50 &#65533;g/kg of CP 55,940 (i.p.) enhanced this avoidance response.  Unfortunately, Lewis rats showed exceptionally high avoidance of the cat odour making it difficult to discern the effects of CP 55,940.  To avoid this problem a second experiment was conducted, where rats were tested in the same arena as in the first experiment but with no cat odour present.  Again in Wistar, but not Lewis rats, 25 and 50 &#65533;g/kg of CP 55,940 (i.p.) increased the avoidance of the open space.  In the third experiment, Lewis and Wistar rats were placed in a chamber in which they had previously received footshock.  Wistar but not Lewis rats re-exposed under the influence of 10, 25 or 50 &#65533;g/kg CP 55,940 (i.p.) emitted significantly more USVs than vehicle-treated rats.  Thus, CP 55,940 clearly increased anxiety-related behaviour in Wistar rats but not Lewis rats, supporting the notion of a genetic predisposition towards cannabinoid-induced anxiety.    In Chapter 3 the generality of the findings made in Chapter 2 were tested by utilising two further animal models of anxiety, the social interaction and light-dark emergence tests.  From the results of Chapter 2, it could be claimed that Lewis rats were merely subsensitive to the effects of CP 55,940.  Therefore a higher dose range (0, 25, 50 and 75 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) of CP 55,940 was employed in Chapter 3.  In addition, the rotarod test was used to assess whether CP 55,940 has ataxic effects at these doses.  In the first experiment, two unfamiliar rats were placed in a large arena and the time the rats spent socially interacting was recorded.  CP 55,940 significantly reduced the total time rats spent socially interacting in Lewis (25 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) and Wistar rats (50 and 75 &#65533;g/kg).  However, CP 55,940 has a significantly greater effect in Wistar rats compared to Lewis rats.  In the second experiment, rats were placed in a small box within a large open arena and the latency to emerge from this box was measured.  CP 55,940 increased emergence latency (at 75 &#65533;g/kg) and mean time per entry into the box (at 25 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) in Wistar but not Lewis rats.  Furthermore, CP 55,940 caused a greater decrease in time spent in the open arena (at 25 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) and frequency of emergence (at 75 &#65533;g/kg) in Wistar rats in comparison to Lewis rats.  In the third experiment, CP 55,940 (at 25, 50 and 75 &#65533;g/kg) caused mild incoordination only in Lewis rats as measured by the rotarod test.  This finding argues against the assertion that the CP 55,940-induced anxiety-like behaviours in Wistar rats are merely a result of motoric impairment.  Furthermore, it illustrates that Lewis rats are not generally subsensitive to the effects of CP 55,940.  That is, when compared to other rat strains, Lewis rats may be more or less sensitive to the effects of CP 55,940 depending on what behaviour is being assessed.  From the results of Chapters 2 and 3 it can be seen that Lewis rats are less sensitive to the anxiogenic effects of CP 55,940 than Wistar rats.  In Chapter 4 it was hypothesised that in Lewis rats the effects of CP 55,940 on neural substrates of reward far outweigh the effects the compound has on neural substrates mediating anxiety.  To examine this issue, the effects of CP 55,940 at a moderate (50 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) and high (250 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) dose were observed on c-fos expression (a measure of neural activation) and behaviour in Lewis and Wistar rats.  CP 55,940 dose-dependently inhibited locomotor activity and reduced body temperature with Lewis rats being significantly less affected than Wistar rats.  The 250 &#65533;g/kg dose caused significant catalepsy in both strains with a significantly greater effect in Wistar rats.  These strain differences in the effects of CP 55,940 on body temperature and motor behaviour clearly correlated with c-fos expression in various regions and subregions.  In general, Lewis rats showed significantly less Fos-labeled cells in comparison to Wistar rats.  These strain differences in the effects of CP 55,940 on c-fos expression appeared unique to cannabinoids, as cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p.) had equivalent effects on c-fos expression in Lewis and Wistar rats.    CP 55,940 promoted c-fos expression in areas not previously assessed, such as the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), medial preoptic nucleus (MPO), anterior hypothalamic area (AH), islands of Calleja (ICjM), periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg).  The strain differences uncovered in Chapters 2 and 3 correlated well with strain differences in the effects of CP 55,940 on c-fos expression in areas implicated in cannabinoid-induced anxiety, such as the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and PAG.  However, the effects of CP 55,940 on c-fos expression in a neural circuit which may underlie reward, which includes the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAS) and PPTg, were also less in Lewis rats in comparison to Wistar rats.  Future investigations must address whether the reduced effects of CP 55,940 on the Lewis rat are due to pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics.  In addition, future studies must reconcile the pattern of c-fos expression observed here with prior reports of the Lewis rat being a unique "cannabinoid-preferring" strain.  In Chapter 4, CP 55,940 administration promoted c-fos expression in areas of the brain thought to play a critical role in behavioural sensitization such as the ventral tegmental area and NAS.  This is interesting because it is possible that c-fos is involved in promoting neuroadaptations that underlie drug addiction.  To examine this idea, Chapter 5 investigated a behavioural assay of the long-term neural adaptations that may occur with the chronic administration of cannabis, namely, behavioural sensitization.  This chapter also examined an animal model of the "gateway hypothesis", that is, the hypothesis that prior exposure to cannabis increases an individuals vulnerability to using other drugs.  This animal model is known as cross-sensitization.  First it was shown that Lewis, but not Wistar rats, given cocaine (15 mg/kg i.p.) every second day over a two week period displayed a progressively greater locomotor response to the drug over days indicating behavioural sensitization.  When CP 55,940 (0, 10, 25 or 50 &#65533;g/kg i.p.) was administered under a similar regime, no such sensitization was observed in either strain.  Rather, the two highest doses of CP 55,940 (25 and 50 &#65533;g/kg) caused locomotor suppression that lasted throughout administration.  When Lewis or Wistar rats pre-exposed ten times to CP 55,940 were challenged with cocaine (15 mg/kg), no exaggerated locomotor response to cocaine was evident relative to non pre-exposed rats. When these rats were subsequently re-tested with CP 55,940, it continued to produce a dose-dependent suppression of locomotor activity.  Finally, when CP 55,940 (50 &#65533;g/kg) was co-administered with cocaine in Lewis rats, it significantly reduced the locomotor hyperactivity produced by the drug but did not block the development of behavioural sensitization to cocaine.  These results show that CP 55,940 does not sensitize locomotor activity with repeated administration in the same way as cocaine, and that pre-exposure or concurrent exposure to CP 55,940 does not enhance sensitivity to the subsequent behavioural effects of cocaine.  Therefore, unlike Chapters 2, 3 and 4 where strain differences were observed in CP 55,940?induced anxiety, hypothermia, catalepsy, c-fos expression and ataxia, there were no strain differences with respect to behavioural sensitization.    Landmark studies by Gardner and colleagues showed that Lewis rats are particularly susceptible, in comparison to other rat strains, to the rewarding effects of delta 9-THC on: 1) medial forebrain bundle (MFB) self-stimulation behaviour and; 2) dopamine (DA) efflux in the NAS.  However, in Chapter 4 Lewis rats were less susceptible than Wistar rats to CP 55,940-induced c-fos expression in the NAS.  Further, Lewis rats showed no behavioural sensitization to the chronic administration of CP 55,940.  In light of these findings, Chapter 6 assessed whether CP 55,940 does have a rewarding effect on MFB self-stimulation behaviour in Lewis rats.  Lewis rats were trained to self-stimulate the MFB using a rate?frequency paradigm and then administered CP 55,940 (0, 10, 25 and 50 &#65533;g/kg i.p.).  CP 55,940 had no effect on MFB self-stimulation behaviour as assessed by the M50, the stimulation frequency at which half-maximal response rates were obtained.  This result calls into question previous assertions that Lewis rats are a "cannabis-preferring" strain of rat.   Previous studies utilising the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, SR 141716, have shown that the endogenous cannabinoid system may have some involvement in the rewarding effects of cocaine, morphine, sucrose and alcohol.  Thus, Chapter 6 also assessed the effects of SR 141716 (0, 1, 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p.) on MFB stimulation in Lewis rats.  The role of DA in MFB stimulation reward has already been established, so for comparison purposes the effects of the DA D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.06 mg/kg i.p.) was also assessed.  Only a very high dose of SR 141716 (20 mg/kg) caused a significant inhibition of the rewarding efficacy of the stimulation with all other doses (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg) being ineffective in modulating the rewarding impact of brain stimulation.  This was seen as an increase in M50.  By comparison, a relatively low dose (0.06 mg/kg) of SCH 23390 caused a large increase in M50. These results indicate a relatively modest influence of the endogenous cannabinoid system on reward-relevant neurotransmission in the self-stimulation paradigm.   Chapter 7 concludes the thesis and discusses the implications of the results obtained.  The main findings of the current thesis are: 1) that the suggested "addiction-prone" Lewis strain of rat is less susceptible to cannabinoid-induced anxiety in comparison to Wistar rats; 2) Lewis rats show less cannabinoid-induced c-fos expression in comparison to Wistar rats (including in brain regions implicated in cannabinoid-induced anxiety and reward); 3) cannabinoid-induced c-fos expression exists in a number of brain regions never previously assessed such as the MPO, ICjM and PPTg; 4) behavioural sensitization does not occur with the repeated administration of CP 55,940; 5) cannabinoid pre-exposure or co-administration does not increase the sensitivity of the locomotor-activating effects of cocaine; 6) the endogenous cannabinoid system, at most, only has a minor influence on the neural substrate of brain stimulation reward and; 7) that there are previously unreported strain differences in cannabinoid-induced hypothermia, catalepsy and ataxia.  These results add to our understanding of the effects of the behavioural, emotional and neural effects of cannabinoids and the endogenous cannabinoid system.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CP 55;940;cannabinoids;rats;behaviour;neuroscience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/364</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors that affect the delivery of diabetes care.</field><field name="creator">Overland, Jane Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Diabetes is emerging as a major threat to health, with global economic and social implications.  Recent research has shown that the morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes can be reduced by timely and effective treatment. However, unless people with diabetes have access to this treatment, the impact of diabetes will continue to rise.   This thesis therefore explores the current standards of care which people with diabetes receive. It also looks at factors likely to impact on delivery of diabetes care.  Studies were conducted at two levels.  In the studies described in Chapters 2 and 3, general data applicable to all or nearly all patients with diabetes were collected.  This approach substantially eliminates selection bias but precludes the ability to examine clinical outcomes.  In the other studies, detailed in Chapters 4, 5 and 6, specific aspects of diabetes care pertaining to more select groups of diabetic subjects were examined.  This approach allows clinical parameters to be examined in more detail but is more subject to selection bias.  It is hoped that the combination of these two approaches provides a more balanced view of the topic under examination.      In Australia, the Medicare Program, a single government controlled universal health insurance fund, provides access to medical services for all residents.  Medicare occasions of service data therefore represent the most comprehensive source of information regarding health service utilisation in Australia.  The data does not account for people receiving diabetes care through public hospital based services.  However, a survey of public hospitals within NSW (n=198), described in Chapter 2, showed that the number of individuals in this category is relatively small and represents only 5.2% of the diabetic population.     Using Medicare item codes, and with the permission and assistance of the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care, data were extracted on attendance to medical practitioners and utilisation of diabetes related procedures for people living in New South Wales (NSW) for the individual years between 1993 to 1997.  All data were stratified by the presence of diabetes, gender and age group.  Individuals were deemed to have diabetes if an HbA1c, which can only be ordered for a person with known diabetes, had been performed over the 5-year period and the sample size adjusted for the incidence of diabetes.  Once adjusted, the number of people with diabetes in NSW for the individual years 1993 to 1997 were 143,920, 156,234, 168,216, 177,280 and 185,780.  Comparison with 1996 census data confirmed a 91.7% capture of the total NSW population (5,495,900/5,995,545 individuals).    The data were retrieved for NSW as a whole and for individual postcodes.  Postcodes were then classified by population density as either major urban, urban or rural. On average over the study period, persons with diabetes accounted for 3.1% of the population but they used 5.5% of general practitioner services.  As seen in Chapter 2, a large proportion of people with diabetes were also under the care of specialists and consultant physicians, up to 51.2% and 41.8% respectively, a 3 to 4 fold increase when compared with their non-diabetic counterparts.  In regard to geographical location, once adjusted for age and gender, the odds ratio of attending a specialist was only slightly higher for people with diabetes living in areas of high population density when compared to people with diabetes living in rural areas.  This ratio reached as high as 1.85 in regard to attendance to consultant physicians (Chapter 3).  The odds ratio for the non-diabetic population was similar indicating that the difference in access to consultant physicians was not disease specific.     Analysis of results showed that despite the increase in service utilisation, large proportions of people with diabetes were not routinely monitored in regard to diabetes and its complications across the State.  By 1997, HbA1c was still not performed in over 40% of people with diabetes each year and only 11.6% of the diabetic population had undergone microalbuminuria estimation.  Interestingly, the differences in levels of monitoring between rural and urban areas were surprisingly small.  Monitoring of diabetes and its complications did improve in all parts of the State over the study period.  However, the greatest improvement was seen in rural areas, despite rural patients having fewer attendances to general practitioners and fewer patients attending specialist care.    In the face of finite resources and the rising prevalence of diabetes, an increasing number of patients will need to rely on general practitioners to provide diabetes care regardless of where they live.  A 'shared care' approach which encourages and supports general practitioners to manage patients with diabetes, while giving them access to specialist services for those patients that require them, is increasingly being advocated as a way of maximising efficacy while minimising costs.  Yet if health care professionals leave undone what they think is done by others, shared care can become neglected care.  Chapter 4 reports a detailed audit of 200 randomly selected shared care patients who were assessed on two or more occasions.  This study showed that the majority of specialist treatment recommendations are implemented by general practitioners.  Doctors formally registered with the Diabetes Shared Care Programme and those who write longer referral letters were more likely to implement recommendations than their counterparts.  Moreover, the average HbA1c and the complication profile of these patients were similar to those found in various studies around the world.  This suggests that diabetes can be well managed by a shared care approach that is adequately integrated.      To overcome the problem that data is lacking on those patients that did not return for specialist review, a further 200 shared care patients who were lost to follow up from the shared care system were traced.  Information regarding whether treatment recommendations had been implemented was sought from both the referring doctor and the patient.  Overall, information on 182 of the 200 patients could be obtained.  As discussed in Chapter 5, comparison of the returned and non returned patients' demographic and clinical profiles at time of their initial specialist review showed that general practitioners differentiated between the 'more complicated' patients, choosing to re-refer those with macrovascular disease, while maintaining the care of 'less complicated' patients. Re-referral for specialist review was also dependent on the patient remaining under the care of their original doctor.   Encouragingly, general practitioners seemed to take a more active role in the non-returned group.  They included more details regarding type and duration of diabetes in the referral letters of patients who were not re-referred for specialist review.  They also implemented more treatment recommendations in the non-returned group, with the difference in implementation rate for metabolic recommendations reaching statistical significance.  This study also showed that movement of patients between doctors raises concern regarding continuity of care.    The multi-factorial nature of diabetes means that best practice is not easily accommodated within a single appointment.  Thus continuity of care becomes an important issue.  To assess the current status, 479 consecutive patients referred to the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Diabetes Centre in a 6-month period were recruited and underwent a detailed clinical assessment.  They were also questioned regarding the number of general practitioners they attended and the length of time they had been under the care of the referring doctor.   The results outlined in Chapter 6 showed that the majority of people with diabetes (87.7%) attended only one general practitioner and had been under the care of that doctor medium to long term.  Younger patients, who were relatively healthy apart from the presence of diabetes, were more likely to attend several general practitioners or have changed their general practitioner within the last year.  This lack of continuity had little difference on acute outcomes such as glycaemic and blood pressure control.  Appropriately, continuity of care increased with increasing age and the increasing prevalence of diabetes complications, mainly macrovascular disease.    These studies indicate that further efforts are required to improve the overall standard of diabetes care within Australia.  At present there is a heavy dependency on specialist services.  As the population ages and the number of people with diabetes increases, much of this burden will fall on general practitioners, as is already evident in rural areas.  When provided with appropriate support and infrastructure, general practitioners are able to maintain standards of care through referral of patients with more complex medical problems and by maintaining the degree of continuity appropriate to the patient's needs.  However, the collection of relevant information to monitor future trends in diabetes services provision is important.  As shown in this thesis, Medicare data represents an easy and cost effective method with which to do so.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes;standard of care;shared care;continuity of care;service utilisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising and Mapping Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses (PERVs)</field><field name="creator">Lee, Jun Heon</field><field name="description">The initial focus of this PhD project was on comparative gene mapping. Comparative gene mapping is facilitated by consensus PCR primers which amplify homologous gene fragments in many species. As a part of an international co-ordinated programme of comparative mapping in pigs, 47 CATS (Comparative Anchor Tagged Sequence) consensus primer pairs for loci located on human chromosomes 9, 10, 20, and 22, were used for amplifying homologous loci in pigs. After optimization of PCR conditions, 23 CATS products have confirmed by comparison with homologous sequences in GenBank. A French somatic cell hybrid panel was used to physically map the 6 porcine CATS products distinguishable from rodent background product, namely ADRA1A, ADRA2A, ARSA, GNAS1, OXT and TOP1. Of these, the map location of ADRA1A and OXT showed inconsistency with the previously recognised conserved relationship between human and pig. The other four loci mapped to positions consistent with known syntenic relationships. Despite low levels of polymorphism, frequently indistinguishable rodent and porcine products in somatic hybrids and some confusion of identity of gene family members, these CATS primers have made a useful contribution to the porcine-human comparative map.  The focus of the project then changed to genetic and molecular characterisation of endogenous retroviruses in pigs and their relatives. Pigs are regarded as a potentially good source of organs and tissues for transplantation into humans. However, porcine endogenous retroviruses have emerged as a possible problem as they can infect cultured human cells. Two main types of pig retrovirus, determined by envelope protein, PERV-A and PERV-B, are widely distributed in different pig breeds and a third less common type, PERV-C, has also been recognised. Endogenous retroviruses were analyzed from the Westran (Westmead transplantation) inbred line of pig, specially bred for biomedical research. Thirty-one 1.8 kb env PCR product clones were sequenced after preliminary screening with the restriction enzymes KpnI and MboI. Five recombinant clones between A and B were identified. 55% of clones (17/31) sequenced had stop codons within the envelope protein-encoding region, which would prevent the retrovirus from making full-length envelope protein recognizable by cell-surface receptors of the virus. The endogenous viruses were physically mapped in Westran pigs by FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation) using PERV-A and PERV-B envelope clones as probes. Preliminary FISH data suggest that there are at least 22 PERVs (13 PERV-A and 9 PERV-B) and the chromosomal locations of these in the Westran strain are quite different from European Large White pigs. The sequences and mapping results of inbred Westran pig suggest that there are relatively few PERV integration sites compared with commercial pigs and further that a large proportion of clones are defective due to premature stop codons in the envelope gene.   To investigate the relationship of endogenous retroviruses in peccaries and pigs, a set of degenerate primers was used to amplify peccary retroviral sequences. The sequences of two putative retroviral clones showed close homology, albeit with a 534 bp deletion, to mouse and pig retroviral sequences. Also, four non-target sequences were amplified from peccary with the degenerate retroviral primers. They are a part of the peccary cofilin gene, a SINE, and a sequence containing a microsatellite. The peccary endogenous retroviral sequences are significant in that they are the first such sequences reported in peccary species and repudiate old claims in the literature that peccaries do not have C-type retroviral sequences.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PERVs (Porcine Endogenous Retroviruses);Pig;CATS (Comparative Anchor Tagged Sequences);Gene Mapping</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in Multi dimensional Signal Demodulation</field><field name="creator">Larkin, Kieran Gerard</field><field name="description">Problems in the demodulation of one, two, and three-dimensional signals are investigated. In one-dimensional linear systems the analytic signal and the Hilbert transform are central to the understanding of both modulation and demodulation. However, it is shown that an efficient nonlinear algorithm exists which is not explicable purely in terms of an approximation to the Hilbert transform. The algorithm is applied to the problem of finding the envelope peak of a white light interferogram. The accuracy of peak location is then shown to compare favourably with conventional, but less efficient, techniques. In two dimensions (2-D) the intensity of a wavefield yields to a phase demodulation technique equivalent to direct phase retrieval. The special symmetry of a Helmholtz wavefield allows a unique inversion of an autocorrelation. More generally, a 2-D (non-Helmholtz) fringe pattern can be demodulated by an isotropic 2-D extension of the Hilbert transform that uses a spiral phase signum function. The range of validity of the new transform is established using the asymptotic method of stationary phase. Simulations of the algorithm confirm that deviations from the ideal occur where the fringe pattern curvature is larger than the fringe frequency. A new self-calibrating algorithm for arbitrary sequences of phase-shifted interferograms is developed using the aforementioned spiral phase transform. The algorithm is shown to work even with discontinuous fringe patterns, which are known to seriously hamper other methods. Initial simulations of the algorithm indicate an accuracy of 5 milliradians is achievable. Previously undocumented connections between the demodulation techniques are uncovered and discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signal processing;image processing;demodulation;multi-dimensional signals;Hilbert transform</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of the association between toxin producing staphylococcus, biochemical changes and jaw muscle pain.</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Neil Roland</field><field name="description">Objectives: To assess the expression of the symptoms of jaw muscle pain and its association with alterations in biochemistry, other symptoms and the carriage of staphylococci.  Methods: Three different study populations were assessed.  The first was selected and examined by the author and consisted of 43 pain and 41 age and sex matched controls.  The second was a study of CFS patients who were blinded to the author and the author subsequently examined the associations between jaw muscle symptom reporting and the standardised biochemistry measures.  The third study was also blinded to the author but included an investigation of staphylococci and certain cytokine and biochemistry measures.    Results: The three studies clearly establish an association between the carriage of toxicogenic coagulase negative staphylococci and the expression of jaw muscle pain in both males and females.  These associations were homogeneous and were found whether the patients were selected on the basis of having jaw muscle pain or selected from within a population of patients selected on the basis of having Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.  The studies associated the changes with variations in biochemistry and these were in turn associated with symptom expression within the jaw muscle pain patients.  These biochemical alterations included the dysregulation of immune cell counts, cytokines, electrolyte and protein metabolism.

From the data a model was developed which shows the mechanisms involved in the development of chronic pain in the jaw muscles.

The aim of the thesis was to investigate the  distribution and factors influencing allergens of Alternaria in the air. As airborne  allergenic spores were thought to arise from harvesting of nearby crops, two towns with  different agricultural practices were studied. Moree has two crop harvesting periods in  summer and autumn whilst Wagga Wagga has one harvesting period in summer.  Over two years, air was sampled daily in Wagga Wagga and Moree using Burkard traps.  The reliability of measurements from a single site to represent the distribution of  airborne concentrations of spores across each town was examined using data from three  traps simultaneously, sited 2.0 to 4.9 km apart, over four weeks. Substantial intra-class  correlation coefficients (ICC) were observed between the three sampling sites across  both towns (ICC=0.52, 95% CI 0.30-0.71 to 0.76, 95% CI 0.61-0.87) when counts of  Alternaria spores were relatively high. The correlation was poor when counts were low.  Of more than 365 trap tapes examined, the two microscopic traverses strongly correlated  for counts of Alternaria spores (ICC=0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96). Alternaria was detected  in both towns throughout the two year period with peaks in spore concentrations  reflecting the season of crop harvesting in each region.  Individual exposure to spores was examined. Thirty three subjects (adults and children  from nine families) wore nasal air samplers and personal air samplers both inside and  outside their homes. The effects of activity, location, age on the inhalation of Alternaria  spores and variation between individuals in the same environment were determined.  Every subject inhaled Alternaria spores. Personal exposure to Alternaria in the home  environment varied substantially between subjects. Levels of fungal spores inhaled were  higher during periods of activity than during rest, and higher while subjects were  outdoors than indoors. During outdoor activity, the number of Alternaria spores inhaled  ranged from 4 to 794 (median 11) spores/hr.  Sources of airborne spores was investigated by sampling air above wheat and cotton  crops near the towns during harvesting and non-harvesting periods, in a grain and cotton  seed storage shed, and a cotton gin. Substantially higher concentrations were detected  above crops during harvesting periods compared to non-harvesting periods. Peaks were  associated with harvesting and other activities where plants were manipulated. By  regression analysis spore concentrations in both towns were modelled against those  detected above crops and with weather variables. Only one crop sampling period (cotton  harvest) independently correlated with concentrations in town. Analysis combining all  data showed concentrations of spores above crops correlated with spore concentrations  in the town when lagged by one day. Variables of rainfall and maximum temperature  influenced concentrations in both towns, and wind direction in Wagga Wagga alone.  Parents of asthmatic children were asked by questionnaire in which locations symptoms  were provoked. Asthma was reported to be exacerbated at grain farms and with  disturbance of local vegetation in town and home gardens. Nasal sampling confirmed  that activities that disturbed dust or vegetation increased the inhalation of spores.  The factors that release allergen from spores were determined in a modified Halogen  immunoassay. Approximately 60% of spores released allergen, and the proportion was  influenced by isolate, nutrient availability, viability, and not influenced by sunlight or  culture age up to 21 days. Germinating the spores significantly increased the proportion  that released total allergen and Alt a 1 (p&lt;0.0001). Alt a 1 appears to be a minor  contributor to the total allergen released from spores except when spores have  germinated.  Conclusions: People living in inland rural regions of Australia are exposed to  substantial quantities of allergenic spores of Alternaria. Exposure is a highly personal  event and is largely determined by disturbance of local vegetation releasing spores such  as from nearby crops by wind, harvesting, slashing, transport and processing of produce,  and from within town and home gardens. Most spores inhaled are likely to be allergenic,  with potency potentially increasing with viability.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">allergen;Alternaria;rural;south-eastern Australia;Australia;fungus;asthma;spore;Burkard trap;Moree;Wagga Wagga;New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Linguistic Characterisation of Design in Text-Based Virtual Worlds</field><field name="creator">Cicognani, Anna</field><field name="description">In this research, it is suggested that design in text-based virtual worlds  can be identified as a series of interactions between users and the virtual  environment, and that these interactions for design can be approached using  a linguistic perspective.

Design in text-based virtual environments can then be  articulated using a restricted set of speech acts, as design commands.  Virtual worlds, represented as spaces, can be constructed following an  architectural design metaphor. This metaphor provides a framework for the  organisation of virtual entity relationships, and for the choice of words  used to design.

Differences in the amount of stimulus exposure and deprivation state between groups were controlled for. The first experiment presented two novel flavours twelve times to rats when either thirsty or sated. A preference for the flavour presented when thirsty was established. The next three experiments examined whether this preference would accelerate the extinction of a taste aversion, by first pairing a novel flavour with lithium and then presenting the conditioned flavour when rats were either sated or thirsty. No evidence of accelerated extinction was found. The final two experiments examined whether the associatively-activated representation of sucrose could function to extinguish a taste-aversion to that sucrose without presenting sucrose itself. No evidence of representation-mediated extinction was found despite evidence that the context was associated with sucrose. The results indicate that the extinction of conditioned taste aversions is not influenced by counter-conditioning due to thirst relief, and extinction of such aversions appears to be due to similar processes as other forms of conditioning.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rats;learning;tastes;LiCl;extinction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Murray River Turtle, Emydura macquarii: Population Dynamics, Nesting Ecology and Impact of the Introduced Red Fox, Vulpes vulpes</field><field name="creator">Spencer, Ricky-John</field><field name="description">I studied aspects of the ecology of the Murray River turtle, Emydura macquarii, to determine the impact of the introduced red fox, Vulpes vulpes. The fox is one of Australia's worst vertebrate pests through its predation on livestock and native mammals, but their impact on reptilian communities is not known.    I conducted a large-scale mark-recapture study to evaluate population growth of E. macquarii in the Albury region of the upper Murray River by determining growth, reproduction and survival. The study was conducted downstream of the first, and largest, impoundment on the Murray River, Lake Hume. Emydura macquarii predominantly inhabit the lagoons in the upper Murray River, as the mainstream and Lake are possibly too cool to maintain metabolic processes. They are easily captured in hoop traps and the use of live decoys maximises trap success.    Over 2000 hatchling turtles were marked and released into two lagoons between January 1997 and January 1998. Growth of these individuals is rapid over the first few years but declines towards maturity, and is indeterminate after maturity. Although growth annuli are not well defined, even on young individuals, the von Bertalanffy model describes the growth of both male and female E. macquarii. Male turtles mature at 5-6 years and females mature at  10-12 years. Female turtles may maximise reproductive potential by delaying maturity and producing one relatively large clutch (mean = 21 eggs) per year, which is positively correlated with body size (PL). Although primarily related to body size, clutch size varies annually because of environmental conditions. If winter and summer rainfalls are below average and temperatures are above average, E. macquarii may reduce clutch size to increase the chance of the eggs surviving.    Nesting predominantly occurs during the first major rain-bearing depression in November. Habitat variables, including distance from water, nearest nest, and tree, and soil type were measured for each nest to determine characteristics that attract predators. Nests close to the shoreline and trees are heavily preyed on, and nests constructed in sand are less likely to be destroyed by predators. Foxes detect nests through a combination of chemical cues from eggs and slight soil disturbances, whereas birds only destroy nests observed being constructed during the day.     Female turtles alter nesting behaviour and construct nests much further away from water when foxes were removed and as a result, nests are less dense and away from trees. Thus in high predation risk areas, turtles minimise emergence and search times to reduce the risk of direct predation by foxes. Predation is reduced when nests are in lower densities and away from trees, because predators increase search efforts when nests are in higher densities and birds are more likely to destroy nests close to trees. Reproductive success is further reduced in high predation risk areas because more nests are constructed in sandy substrates where clutch success is reduced compared to incubation in more dense substrates. Where predators are a significant source of mortality, prey may use indirect methods, such as chemical recognition, to avoid encounters. Nesting turtles did not avoid areas where fox odour was present, suggesting that they assess predation pressure from foxes by other mechanisms, such as visual recognition. However, an innate response occurs to the odour of a once common predator on the Murray River, the eastern quoll (Dasyurus viverrinus), whereby turtles recognise and avoid nesting in areas where quoll odour is present. Therefore nesting turtles show a similar avoidance response to two different predators, using different mechanisms of detection. Similarly, predation risk may influence hatching times and nest emergence. The rate of embryonic development of E. macquarii may increase or eggs may hatch early so that the clutch hatches synchronously, thereby reducing the risk of predation through group emergence from the nest.    Emydura macquarii reach densities of over 100 turtles.ha-1, with the majority of the population consisting of sexually mature individuals. Emydura macquarii has a Type III survival curve where mortality is extremely high in the egg stage (93% nest predation), remaining high over the hatchling stage (minimum survival rate- 10%), but decreasing rapidly throughout the juvenile stage (~70% juvenile survival). Adult survival is extremely high, with greater than 95% of adults surviving each year. Foxes through nest predation cause most mortality but a small proportion (~3%) of nesting adult females are killed by foxes each year. A removal program evaluated the impact of foxes. In 1996, fox numbers were monitored around four lagoons by spotlighting and non-toxic bait uptake. Foxes were removed from around two of the lagoons throughout 1997 and 1998, using spotlight shooting and 1080 bait poisoning. Fox numbers were continually monitored around all four lagoons during the study. Nest predation rates remained around 90% in all sites where foxes were present, but fell to less than 50% when foxes were removed. At the same time, predation on nesting female turtles was eliminated where foxes were removed.    Demographic models using staged based survival schedules, together with growth and fecundity values for E. macquarii show a decline of 4% per year in these populations. Elasticity analyses shows that survival of adult female E. macquarii has the major influence on population stability and a reduction of nest predation alone is unlikely to address the population decline. Management options, such as reducing foxes prior to nesting around key lagoons, will stabilise the population decline, and eliminating foxes completely from certain areas with high dispersal potential, will promote recruitment of juvenile E. macquarii.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia;freshwater turtle;nesting;predation;Emydura macquarii;red fox;Vulpes vulpes;incubation;population dynamics;growth;reproduction;ecology;behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for nu(mu) to nu(e) oscillations in the NOMAD experiment</field><field name="creator">Godley, Andrew</field><field name="description">The NOMAD experiment is a neutrino oscillation experiment, capable of  identifying \nm, \nmb, \nel, \neb\ and \nt\ for use in oscillation analyses.  A search for \mutoe\ oscillations is conducted, emphasising the development  of two separate beam simulators, to provide the background, (no oscillation),  \nel\ signal.     Both beam descriptions include fits to the results of the SPY experiment  that measured hadron production from a 450~GeV proton beam on  beryllium target.  An independent analysis of the raw SPY data to  produce the particle yield is reported.     A series of criteria are described for the selection and classification of  neutrino events. These produce the data samples necessary for both tuning  the beam simulation and determining the oscillation signal.     The development of a GEANT and FLUKA based Monte Carlo beam simulator is  presented, providing good agreement to the measured neutrino beam.  This simulation method has sizeable variations depending on the  beamline geometry, which is not known precisely.  This causes  large systematic errors.     An empirical parametrisation is proposed and used for the first time in a NOMAD  oscillation search.  It uses the measured neutrino spectra at  NOMAD, except the \nel, to infer the meson production at  the target, and then predict the \nel\ spectrum.  This method  has good agreement with the data and is also  insensitive to alterations of the beamline geometry, resulting in  much smaller systematic errors.     The reduction of the systematic errors allows the \mutoe\ oscillations  search to be performed with much greater precision.  Comparisons of  the \nel/\nm\ ratio between the empirical parametrisation and data yields  no evidence for \mutoe\ oscillations, setting a limit on the mixing parameter,  $sin^2(2 \theta) &amp;lt 1.9 \times 10^{-3}  \mbox{(90\% CL)}$ at high $\Delta m^2$.

A case study with 28 couple families, 14 husbands and 14 wives who migrated from Nepal under "skill" or "professional" category and the literature review on paid and unpaid work of couple families with dependent children show that in both families the trend of change of working pattern in paid and unpaid work is similar. With the increased participation of married women in the paid labour force, men increased participation in household work. There is increased household work for both husbands and wives, but women tend to do more household "inside" and childcare work than men. In the mean time, men tend to do more work in the "masculine" sphere of "outside" work in house maintenance, repair and car care.     The only factor that differentiates working pattern of migrant families with Australian born families is the experience of migration and the category that they migrated. The change of working practice of paid and unpaid work of migrant families are affected by the change of family type from extended family to two generational family and their education and previous work experience that they brought along with them. Professional migrants who migrated family as a "unit" migrated spouse and dependent children together and they made their own decision to migrate, unlike other categories of migrants who migrated from political or economic pressure.     One of the important experiences of migrant families is that there are new opportunity, new lifestyle, new intimacy and companionship and new sharing of work between husbands and wives after migration. At the same time, there are losses of extended family relatives, close friends and cultural event which affects their day to day lives. There are Australian based friends who provided support in the initial period of migration but these families do not provide regular assistance or support which family relatives provided in Nepal.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nepalese families;paid and unpaid work;household work;migrant families;professional migrant</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Parallel Navier Stokes Solver for Natural  Convection and Free Surface Flow</field><field name="creator">Norris, Stuart Edward</field><field name="description">A parallel numerical method has been implemented   for solving the Navier  Stokes equations on  Cartesian and non-orthogonal meshes.

Firstly, it describes  the recent upgrade of the MOST to perform an imaging survey of the southern  sky. Secondly, it presents a MOST survey of the Vela supernova remnant  and follow-up multiwavelength studies.      The MOST Wide Field upgrade is the most significant instrumental  upgrade of the telescope since observations began in 1981. It has made  possible the nightly observation of fields with area ~5 square  degrees, while retaining the operating frequency of 843 MHz and the  pre-existing sensitivity to point sources and extended structure. The  MOST will now be used to make a sensitive (rms approximately 1  mJy/beam) imaging survey of the sky south of declination -30&amp;deg.   This survey consists of two components: an extragalactic  survey, which will begin in the south polar region, and a Galactic  survey of latitudes |b| &amp;lt 10&amp;deg. These are expected to take about ten  years. The upgrade has necessitated the installation of 352 new  preamplifiers and phasing circuits which are controlled by 88  distributed microcontrollers, networked using optic fibre. The thesis  documents the upgrade and describes the new systems, including  associated testing, installation and commissioning.      The thesis continues by presenting a new high-resolution radio  continuum survey of the Vela supernova remnant (SNR), made with the  MOST before the completion of the Wide Field upgrade. This remnant is  the closest and one of the brightest SNRs. The contrast between the  structures in the central pulsar-powered nebula and the synchrotron  radiation shell allows the remnant to be identified morphologically as  a member of the composite class.  The data are the first of a  composite remnant at spatial scales comparable with those available  for the Cygnus Loop and the Crab Nebula, and make possible a  comparison of radio, optical and soft X-ray emission from the resolved  shell filaments. The survey covers an area of 50 square degrees at a  resolution of 43&amp;quot x 60&amp;quot, while imaging structures on scales  up to 30'. It has been used for comparison with Wide Field  observations to evaluate the performance of the upgraded MOST.      The central plerion of the Vela SNR (Vela X) contains a network of complex  filamentary structures. The validity of the imaging of these filaments  has been confirmed with Very Large Array (VLA) observations at 1.4 GHz.  Unlike the situation in the Crab Nebula, the filaments are not well correlated  with H-alpha emission. Within a few parsec of the Vela pulsar the emission  is much more complex than previously seen: both very sharp edges and more  diffuse emission are present. It has been postulated that one of the brightest  filaments in Vela X is associated with the X-ray feature (called a `jet')  which appears to be emanating from the region of the pulsar. However, an  analysis of the MOST and VLA data shows that this radio filament has a  flat spectral index similar to another more distant filament within the  plerion, indicating that it is probably unrelated to the X-ray feature.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">(standard astronomical journal format): instrumentation: interferometers telescopes stars: winds;outflows supernova remnants ISM: individual (Vela supernova remnant) pulsars: individual (Vela pulsar;B0833-45)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbial and Geochemical aspects of Selenium cycling in an Estuarine system: Lake Macquarie N.S.W.</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Brett Ian</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This work examined the role of micro-organisms in the biogeochemical cycling of selenium within the  benthic ecosystem of Lake Macquarie, a coastal lake in New South Wales with a history of anthropogenic heavy metal contamination.   Certain micro-organisms possess the ability to oxidise or reduce selenium (Fleming and Alexander, 1973; Doran and Alexander, 1977),  and microbial volatilisation of selenium from contaminated sediments and soils utilising naturally-occurring microflora has been  shown in overseas research (Thompson-Eagle and Frankenberger, 1992) to be a potentially effective remediation strategy.   In examining the impact of micro-organisms upon the oxidation state of selenium in Lake Macquarie sediments, this work also  investigated and characterised selenium (and heavy metal) concentrations, speciation and geochemical phase associations  (an indicator of potential bioavailability) in the sediments. Seven distinct bacterial species indigenous to Lake Macquarie were identified in this work  with the ability to reduce selenium as selenite to elemental selenium, and selenium as selenate to organic forms of selenium,  including volatile methylated selenium compounds.  Metabolic parameters calculated for these organisms compared favourably with those  reported in the literature by other researchers. Mixed populations of sediment micro-organisms were also isolated and studied in this  work for their selenite and selenate reduction abilities. Total reduction of added selenite at levels up to 100 mg/L was  recorded for a number of the organisms studied in this work.  A maximum specific uptake rate for selenite of 3040 mgSe(IV).(gcells)-1.(h)-1 for  one isolate (Shewanella putrefaciens) was determined, exceeding rates reported in the literature by other authors.   Use of the indigenous micro-organisms from Lake Macquarie for the bioremediation of selenium containing waste streams was also examined in this  work and selenium reduction in an immobilised cell reactor was demonstrated with such organisms. Concentrations, speciation, sediment core profiles  and geochemical phase associations for selenium were determined for sediment samples collected at a variety of sites throughout  Lake Macquarie and from Wyee Creek, a selenium-impacted fluvial input to the lake.   The maximum concentration of selenium obtained in this work for the lake proper was 4.04 mg/kg, considerably lower than values reported over a decade ago  (Batley, 1987) but consistent with reported reductions of selenium input into the lake from the lead-zinc smelter.  Selective extraction methodology  (Tessier et al. and BCR methods) studied geochemical phase association of selenium in Lake Macquarie sediments and found up to 44% of selenium  was in bioavailable forms.  Of interest and environmental concern was levels of selenium found in sediments of Wyee Creek, which previously  received overflows from the ash dam associated with the Vales Point Power Station.  Sediment selenium levels of up to 300 mg/kg were determined for this creek.   These were an order of magnitude or more greater than those recorded for the lake itself and are of concern as  to the potential impact on benthic organisms and those animals, including humans, who consume them. While this work can only provide a 'snapshot' of  conditions within Lake Macquarie at the time of the sampling events recorded herein, it does make several important contributions to the  understanding of selenium biogeochemistry in Lake Macquarie.  These include: presentation of the hypothesis that selenium levels in surficial sediments  being deposited in the north of the lake have decreased in recent years as a result of selenium reduction measures undertaken by the lead-zinc smelter;  determination that up to 44% of selenium in surficial sediments from the lake is associated with sediment phases in which selenium has the potential to  become remobilized and hence possibly bioavailable; and documentation of selenium concentrations in Wyee Creek, identifying the area as having  selenium concentrations an order of magnitude or more greater than the lake itself. Concerning the role played by microorganisms in the  biogeochemical cycling of selenium in Lake Macquarie, this work has: identified individual isolated and mixed cultures of bacteria that  can reduce selenium as selenite to lower oxidation states; identified individual isolated and mixed cultures of bacteria that can reduce  selenium as selenate to lower oxidation states; identified volatile methylated selenium compounds in the headspace gases of microorganisms reducing selenate; determined Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations for selenate and selenite for organisms isolated from Lake Macquarie;  identified casein hydrolysate as a preferred carbon source for selenium reducing microorganisms from Lake Macquarie; and demonstrated that bioremediation of selenium contaminated waste streams using indigenous organisms from Lake Macquarie is feasible on the laboratory scale. Further research areas suggested by this work include: additional investigations of elevated selenium levels in Wyee Creek sediments; determination of the role of microbes in in-situ selenium reduction; and optimisation of selenium biotreatment/bioremediation of selenium-containing waste streams and sediments. In summary, this work, in rejecting the null hypothesis that the oxidation states of selenium in sediments from Lake Macquarie, NSW,  are independent of microbial activity and accepting the alternate hypothesis that these oxidation states are not independent of microbial activity,  contributes to the understanding of the role of microorganisms in the biogeochemical cycling of selenium, having applicability to  both the specific ecosystem of Lake Macquarie, NSW, and also to selenium cycling in the environment in general.   In addition, this work has identified selenium contamination in Wyee Creek, one of the fluvial inputs to  Lake Macquarie, which was previously been undocumented in the literature and which may pose significant potential risk to humans and the  ecosystem due to sediment selenium levels one or more orders of magnitude higher than those recorded in the lake itself.   Finally, this work has also identified a number of microorganisms indigenous to Lake Macquarie with the ability to reduce selenium from toxic,  mobile forms to less toxic, immobile or volatile forms, and these organisms have been shown to have the potential for use in treatment of  selenium contaminated waste streams and also in the bioremediation of selenium-contaminated sediments.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">selenium, Lake Macquarie, biogeochemistry, bacteria, heavy metals, Wyee Creek</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">EARLY CHILDHOOD STUDENT TEACHERS' REFLECTION ON THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PRACTICE: A LONGITUDINAL STUDY</field><field name="creator">SUMSION, Jennifer</field><field name="description">During the past fifteen years there has been increasing interest in the role of reflection in  professional development, especially amongst teacher educators.  Yet although many preservice programs now place considerable  emphasis on encouraging and assisting student teachers to reflect on their practice, reflection remaings a problematic notion.   There is little consensus, for example, about what constitutes reflection, how it might be identified, and whether it can be promoted. This thesis reports a longitudinal study conducted over four years which explored the above issues within the context of an  early childhood teacher education program, in Sydney (NSW), Australia.  The specific purpose of this study was to investigate  changes in student teachers' reflection on their professional development and practice during their enrolment in the Guided Practice component  of their preservice program. A strength of this study is its focus on reflection as a multidimensional phenomenon involving far more  than the processes of analytical thought typically addressed by most previous research in this area.  Drawing on an eclectic range  of literature, this thesis argues that emotion, imagination, intuition, and contemplation can also play an integral role.   As such, it asserts that reflection can be seen, in effect, as a complex and holistic search for meaning. Conceptualising reflection in this  holistic manner raises numerous methodological challenges.   These challenges and the methodological decisions made in response to them are outlined prior to developing profiles of the  participants' reflection.  These profiles indicated that there was little consistent change in the reflection of eight of the  18 participants.  For four student teachers, on the other hand, there was some change, while for six, there was considerable change.  Several factors which appeared instrumental in hindering or promoting these student teachers' reflection are identified.   These include commitment (or lack of) to teaching and to reflection;  an epistemological perspective of received or constructed knowing; and the extent to which the learning environment was  perceived as supportive.  The study concludes with a discussion of some of the implications for teacher educators and for those  intending to undertake further research into reflection.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">teaching, early childhood, student teacher, student, reflection, development, teacher, educator</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charles Lyell and Gideon Mantell, 1821-1852: Their Quest for Elite Status in English Geology.

In turn, these points raise several wider issues and  inter-related questions concerning the following aspects of English geology in the first half of the nineteenth century. When, why and how did an elite group of geologists emerge in England during this period? Who were its members and what were their characteristics in common? What was the nature and scope of the geological work carried out by the identified elite? In what way did it differ from Mantell's? What social and other barriers did Mantell encounter in his search for scientific and social status? What were the critical factors? In this thesis these issues are examined on a decade-by-decade basis, in three main chapters, as a prelude to examining the central question of why Mantell,  unlike Lyell, did not achieve the status of an elite geologist.  First, an elite group of English geologists is identified through a series of prosopographic and 'screening' analyses of all members of council  of the Geological Society of London (GSL).  Geologists who did not meet the prescribed criteria are taken into account.  Thirteen geologists are identified in the penultimate and final stages of screening over the four decades.  Mantell was the only provincial identified, but he did not attain a position in the final list, which consisted exclusively of a  distinctive group of 'gentleman-specialists'. Second, the concept of a geological 'domain' is introduced to analyse the  nature and scope of the geological work carried out by the identified group. A critical finding is that all members identified  in the final 'screening' list established a 'domain' in one of four categories of the concept and were recognised as the  leading authority or exponent of the domain they had fashioned. Finally, the impact and relative importance of specific  social and other factors on the careers of Lyell and Mantell are examined.  When the findings from each decade of the three chapters are brought together it is shown that by the end of the 1820s it was necessary for a future  elite geologist to be so 'positioned' in terms of basic geological experience, location, income and available time that  he was able to identify and subsequently fashion an appropriate geological 'domain'. 'Gentleman-specialists',  such as Lyell, who were able to follow this strategy, constituted a clearly defined elite that dominated the GSL  in the 1830s and 1840s. Mantell's failure to achieve elite geological status stemmed from the fact that he placed  too much emphasis on fashioning his image and social status, rather than his scientific career.  In doing so, he let the opportunity slip of establishing a major domain - British fossil reptiles - in the early 1830s.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Elite geological status; relevant social factors; geological domains; positioning, early nineteenth century England; gentlemen specialists;</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Emulsion Polymerization of Vinyl Acetate</field><field name="creator">De Bruyn, Hank</field><field name="description">Abstract    This work investigates the kinetics of the emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate. Several aspects of this system have been clarified, including the induced decomposition of persulfate, retardation by oxygen and entry by, and analysis of, the aqueous phase oligomeric radicals.    It has been shown that the retardation period observed in the emulsion polymerization of VAc can be explained by the effect of traces of oxygen (&lt; 10-6 M) on the entry efficiency of the initiator-derived aqueous-phase oligomeric radicals.    Comparison of rates of polymerization in V and persulfate -initiated polymerizations together with electrospray mass spectrometry of aqueous phase oligomers, has shown that the mechanism for the induced decomposition of persulfate by vinyl acetate is chain transfer to initiator from aqueous-phase oligomeric radicals. A value has been determined for the rate coefficient for transfer to initiator, by fitting literature data to a model based on this mechanism.    The reported independence of the rate of polymerization from the monomer concentration in the emulsion polymerization of vinyl acetate has been investigated. Possible explanations for this behaviour have been proposed and tested in this work, by measuring radical-loss rates directly with y-relaxation techniques. Although the Y relaxations were found to be affected by experimental artefacts, it has been demonstrated that rapid exit is not responsible for the high radical-loss rates in this system.    The major artefact identified in the y relaxations was the significant effect of relatively small exotherms on relaxation behaviour, Methodologies were developed for correcting affected data and for avoiding exotherms under certain conditions.    Arrhenius parameters were determined for the rate coefficient for chain transfer to monomer using the In^M method, which utilises the whole MWD. This section of the work is incomplete, for reasons detailed in chapter 5. However, as a preliminary indication it was found that the frequency factor was 106.38 M-1 s-1 and the activation energy was 38.8 kJ mol-1.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emulsion polymerization, kinetics, vinyl acetate, persulfate, gamma, free radicals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNOEA: THE GENESIS OF DAYTIME SOMNOLENCE AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT - AROUSALS, HYPOXIA AND CIRCADIAN RHYTHM</field><field name="creator">JOFFE, David</field><field name="description">Obstructive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) is a disease characterised by repetitive upper airway obstructions which are manifest by desaturation and arousal from sleep.

Under the notion of alignment, certain categories, prosodic and morphological, are required to correspond to certain other categories, prosodic or morphological. The alignment of categories is achieved through the operation of constraints which evaluate the wellformedness of outputs. The constraints on the alignment of categories and the ranking of these constraints are examined with emphasis on two Australian languages, Warlpiri and Arrernte. The aim is to provide an adequate account in the theory of Optimality of the processes of stress, reduplication and vowel harmony evident in the data.           The thesis expands on the range of edges for the alignment of feet. Foot alignment is developed to account for the fact that the edges of intonational phrases, morphemes, and specific morphemes, as well as phonologically specific syllables, play an active role in determining the location of feet. An additional finding is that the location of feet can also be determined by adjacency, resolving conflict between morphological alignment, and ensuring rhythmic harmony. Requirements on adjacency are further supported to account for segmental harmony, where harmony provides evidence for the simultaneous action of segmental and prosodic processes.         The analysis provides a unified account of binary and ternary rhythm recommending modifications to alignment of certain categories, thereby laying the groundwork to deal with variation. The account of variation involves relaxing certain constraints.    In addition, the notion of rhythm is expanded to account for onset sensitivity to stress, with evidence of this sensitivity found in reduplication and allomorphy.    The interaction of prosodic categories with each other and with morphological categories can be directly captured in OT, providing a unified and coherent account of phenomena, some of which were previously seen as exceptions and, therefore unrelated and arbitrary.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optimality, Warlpiri, arrernte, Stress, reduplication, syllables</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Shapeliness of the Shekinah: Structural Unity in the Thought of Peter Steele SJ</field><field name="creator">Rayment, Colette Eleanor</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Professor Peter Steele S.J. cuts a fascinating figure both in contemporary scholarship and poetic achievement.  His work extends over a vast range of genre from poetry to criticism, public address and intellectual journalism.  Some of his huge literary output is published, some of it awaits publication, and much of it is either uncollected or held in archival situations.  Steele is a writer who matters today not only by virtue of his leading a distinguished academic career, and being a widely published poet,  but also because for some two decades he has been a focal figure in the Society of  Jesus in Australia and New Zealand and has had  extensive experience as he would say 'plying his priesthood' in various British and American Jesuit institutions.  This has resulted in a large volume of mostly unpublished writings ranging from prayers, liturgies and reflections to homilies for private and public occasions. The challenge of addressing Steele&#65533;'s literary achievement lies in the fact that his spiritual insights form the basis of his poetic, academic,  and ethical imagination. This thesis has attempted to identify the core nature of  these insights and to trace the way in which they ramify  into the world of people, events, and art, especially literature. The basic issue concerns the principle of radiance, how it finds  expression through Steele&#65533;s major motifs or figures of  Jester,  Pilgrim Expatriate, Celebrant and Word or Witness,  and how this principal operates as the unifying basis of his thought. The thesis tries to investigate this unifying vision within the subtle diversity  of the many ways Steele encounters the modern world. In identifying Steele&#65533;s structure of thought as a radiant entity focused on the theocentre of God and emanating to the  Incarnate  God,   to the writers of the gospels and epistles, to St. Ignatius, to St. Edmund Campion and to all people especially artists,  it has been necessary to shape each chapter in a roughly parallel manner and to organise it according to these stratafications.  Each chapter places the individual motif within Steele&#65533;'s individual and Ignatian  milieux,  and examines the function of the particular  figure or motif under investigation. Each chapter will then trace the figure (Fool, Pilgrim / Expatriate, Celebrant or Word  Witness), as Steele sees it manifest in God, in Christ, in the scriptures, and as he understands it imparted to Campion, to Ignatius  as he writes the Spiritual Exercises and to writers (and readers) of literature. Each chapter also has variations appropriate to its  subject matter and medium so that for instance the chapter treating Steele&#65533;s Pilgrim figure will consider his treatment of it in both p oetics and homiletics and that treating the Word or Witness will predominantly relate to that figure to his critical appraisal of Peter Porter&#65533;s p oetry and the organisation of the latter will break from the established pattern of organisation in several major ways.  This thesis offers a study of a rich Australian talent operating intellectually, academically, imaginatively and spiritually.  If one were to seek to place Steele amongst similarly minded writers one would have to locate him in the community of writers recognised for their  classical and contemporary sophistication, writers such as Peter Porter, Seamus Heaney, Joseph Brodsky, Derek Walcott and Anthony Hecht.  In this sense Steele is international rather than Australian in his emphasis; but being a true international he also includes Australia in his thinking.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">jester, pilgrim, expatriate, celebrant , word, Ignatius Loyola, Spiritual Exercises, radiance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Screening Mothers: Representations of motherhood in Australian films from 1900 to 1988.</field><field name="creator">Pascoe, Caroline Myra</field><field name="description">Although the position of mothers has changed considerably since the beginning of the twentieth century, an idealised notion of motherhood persists. The cinema provides a source of information about attitudes towards mothering in Australian society which is not diminished by the fact that mothers are often marginal to the narrative. While the study recognises that cinematic images are not unconditionally authoritative, it rests on the belief that films have some capacity to reflect and influence society.     The films are placed in an historical context with regard to social change in Australian society, so that the images can be understood within the context of the time of the making and viewing of the films. The depictions of the mother are scrutinised with regard to her appearance, her attitude, her relationship with others and the expectations, whether explicit or implicit, of her role. Of particular significance is what happens to her during the film and whether she is punished or rewarded for her behaviour. The conclusions reached after analysis are used to challenge those ideas which assume that portrayals of motherhood are unchangeable and timeless.    The study examines Australian feature films from 1900 to 1988. To augment its historical focus, it uses sociological, psychoanalytical and feminist theoretical writing with special relevance for motherhood and mothering practice. Looking at areas of importance to mothers, it comprises an exploration of what makes a mother good or bad; the significance of the birth of female and male children; the relationship of mothers to daughters; the mother's sexuality and the metaphor of the missing mother. It shows that images of motherhood on screen are organised according to political, social and economic requirements in the community. Further, films frequently show mothers in traditional roles which are useful for maintaining notions of patriarchal privilege in society. The analysis exposes stereotypical depictions of motherhood which are often inaccurate, unfair and oppressive to women.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">films, cinema, mother, motherhood, birth, daughter, bush</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Origins of Persisting Poor Aboriginal Health: An Historical Exploration of Poor Aboriginal Health and the Continuity of the Colonial Relationship as an Explanation of the Persistence of Poor Aboriginal Health.</field><field name="creator">Bartlett, William Bennett</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the history of Central Australia and specifically the development of health services in the Northern Territory.

This explanation is sought by means of an analysis of the forces which have shaped Australia's  trade policy-making towards the U.S. in the five trading sectors of wheat, sugar, beef, steel and international air passenger transport. The study adopts a theoretical framework which postulates that state actors and institutions are principally responsible for trade policy-making and  the concomitant bargaining strategies adopted to improve trade outcomes.  However, a state-centred approach needs to be qualified by state actors'  accomodation of societal-actor demands for policy action.  While exogenous to this domestic bargaining process, influences emanating from the  international political economy must also be taken into account.  The relationship within and between state and societal actors, influenced as  they are by international institutions and ideas, are critical to understanding the bargaining approaches made by one state towards another. It is argued that sectoral trading outcomes between Australia and the U.S. can be understood by reference to a bilateral bargaining process  within each trading sector.  Within each such bargaining process, Australia has, within broad bilateral and multilateral approaches, devised  strategies by which it could mobilize sectorally-specific resources to seek to exploit opportunities and minimise problems so as to improve its trading outcomes.   The nature of these sectoral strategies has been influenced by first, the nature of the U.S. policy and policy-making process; second, the Australian domestic  bargaining process between state and societal actors; and third, and to a lesser extent, prevailing ideas and the perceptions of the negotiating parties.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">economy, political economy, trade, Australia, US, U.S., United States, America, policy, policy-making, 1980s, 1990s</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Cepheid Spectra</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Melinda Marie</field><field name="description">Using high resolution optical spectra from Mount John  University Observatory, Mount Stromlo Observatory and  the Anglo-Australian Observatory, new,  high accuracy radial velocity curves have been   obtained for the two bright southern Cepheids l carinae (HR 3884)  and beta doradus (HR 1922). An indepth investigation  into period variations, cycle-to-cycle and long-term variations  in the velocity curves and the reliability of the combination of   velocity data from different observatories is carried out.  Evidence for shock waves in the atmosphere of l car and resonance   in beta dor is discussed.      A grid of static model atmospheres incorporating plane-parallel  geometry is compared with the  observational spectra of both Cepheids, using line depth ratios,  to determine the variation in   effective temperature, surface gravity and microturbulence  with phase. This information is  used to determine the phase dependence of the surface-brightness  for both Cepheids. The surface brightness  variation with phase was found to follow an almost linear relationship.      The distance to and radius of the Cepheids are determined   using both a near-infrared version of the Barnes-Evans  method and the Fourier Baade-Wesselink (BW) method.   The derived radii and distances agree within the  limits of the errors for both methods.   The Fourier BW method was found to be very sensitive to   phase shifts between the photometric and spectroscopic  data and the derived distance highly dependent  on the assumed reddening.       An investigation into line profile variations in l car and  beta dor has revealed the magnitude of these phenomena  increase as the pulsational period of the Cepheid   increases. It is estimated that line level  variations introduce an additional uncertainty into derived  radii of approximately 4 per cent for beta dor and 10 per cent in lcar.  The uncertainty introduced into derived distances and radii  by line profile asymmetries  was estimated to be of the order of  6 per cent in beta dor and 10 per cent in l car.      A comparative analysis is made of the hydrogen line radial velocity  curves of l car and beta dor.  A trend in the properties of these radial velocity  curves with period has been revealed.   In longer period Cepheids, the Halpha line seems to be forming  in a region that does not partake in the pulsation as a whole,  probably in a chromospheric shell.      A quantitative analysis of the asymmetries in these lines  reveal large redward asymmetries near maximum infall velocity. The   magnitude of these asymmetries and the period  for which they are present are larger in l Car than in beta dor.  The blueward asymmetries in the Halpha line in l Car are  comparable in magnitude to the redward asymmetries while  the other lines exhibit only small blueward asymmetries.      A qualitative analysis of these line profiles with phase reveal  no conclusive evidence for line doubling in these Cepheids. Evidence  of emission is found in the Halpha and H Beta lines of beta dor and l car.   The strength and duration of the emission is found to be greater   in the longer period Cepheid. Although it is likely that this  emission is shock-related, theoretical work is needed to   determine the exact origin of the emission.      A non-LTE radiative hydrodynamic model for l Car has been created.  This atmosphere will be used in further work to calculate synthetic spectral  line profiles which will aid the interpretation  of our observational results.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cepheids radial velocity spectroscopy stars fundamental parameters atmospheres distance BE BW</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Empirical Study of Marine Biological Resources</field><field name="creator">Kennelly, Steven James</field><field name="description">The papers presented in this thesis represent my contributions to the empirical study of marine biological resources.

Wood dust, endotoxins, and allergenic fungi are the main hazards found in woodworking environments.  Relatively very few studies have been done on wood dust exposure. The present study was designed to comprehensively investigate the health effects of  wood dust exposure, and in particular provide new information regarding: Exposure to (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucans in an occupational environment; Levels of exposure to wood dust and biohazards associated with wood dust in different woodworking environments; Correlations among personal exposures, especially correlations between   (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucans and fungi exposures, and endotoxins and Gram (-)ve bacteria exposures; Effects of personal exposure to biohazards on lung function; Effects of personal exposure to biohazards on work-related symptoms; and Determinants of inhalable exposures (provide which factors in the environment influence the personal inhalable exposures). Workers at four different woodworking processes; two logging sites, four sawmills, one major woodchipping operation and five  joineries situated in the state of New South Wales in Australia were studied for personal exposure to inhalable dust (n=182) and respirable dust (n=81),  fungi (n=120), Gram (-)ve bacteria (n=120), inhalable endotoxin (n=160), respirable endotoxin (n=79), inhalable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan (n=105), and respirable  (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan (n=62). The workers (n=168) were also tested for lung function. A questionnaire study (n=195) was carried out to determine the prevalence  of work-related symptoms. The geometric mean inhalable exposure at logging sites was 0.56 mg/m3 (n=7), sawmills 1.59 mg/m3 (n=93),  the woodchipping mill 1.86 mg/m3 (n=9) and joineries 3.68 mg/m3 (n=66). Overall, sixty two percent of the exposures exceeded the current standards.  Among joineries, 95% of the hardwood exposures and 35% of the softwood exposures were above the relevant standards. Compared with green mills, the  percentage of samples, which exceeded the hardwood standard was high for dry mills (70% in dry mills, 50% in green mills). The respirable dust exposures were high at the joineries compared with the other worksites.  Exposure levels to fungi at logging sites and sawmills were in the range 103-104 cfu/m3, woodchipping 103-105 cfu/m3 and joineries 102-104 cfu/m3.  The predominant fungi found at sawmills were Penicillium spp. High exposure levels of Aureobasidium pullulans were also found at two sawmills.  At the woodchipping mill the predominant species were Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium spp., and Paecilomyces spp. The sawmills, which employed  kiln drying processes, had lower exposure levels of fungi compared with the green mills. Those workplaces which had efficient dust control systems  showed less exposure to fungi and bacteria. Although mean endotoxin levels were lower than the suggested threshold value of 20 ng/m3, some personal  exposures at sawmills and joineries exceeded the threshold limit value. The mean inhalable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan level at the woodchipping mill was 2.32 ng/m3, at  sawmills 1.37 ng/m3, at logging sites 2.02 ng/m3, and at joineries 0.43 ng/m3. For the respirable size fraction, mean endotoxin and mean (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan  concentrations were much lower, being similar to observed dust concentrations. Significant correlations were found between mean inhalable endotoxin and  Gram (-)ve bacteria levels (p&lt;0.0001), and mean airborne inhalable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan and fungi levels (p=0.0003). The correlations between mean respirable  endotoxin levels vs Gram (-)ve bacteria exposure levels (p=0.005), and respirable (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan exposure levels vs total fungi levels (p=0.005) were also significant. Significant correlations were found between lung function and personal exposures. Multivariate analyses showed that the effect of all the  personal exposures on cross-shift decrements in lung function was more prominent among sawmill and chip mill workers compared with joinery workers. Woodworkers had markedly high prevalence of cough, phlegm, chronic bronchitis, frequent headaches, throat and eye irritations,  and nasal symptoms compared with controls. Among the woodworkers, smokers had a high prevalence of chronic bronchitis (20%)  compared with non-smokers (10%). Some workers also reported a variety of allergy problems due to exposure to various types of wood dust. Both joinery workers and sawmill and chip mill workers revealed significant correlations between work-related symptoms and personal exposures.  Chronic bronchitis was significantly correlated with personal exposure to wood dust, endotoxin, (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan, fungi, and Gram (-)ve  bacteria among joinery workers. Whereas among sawmill workers chronic bronchitis was significantly correlated with personal exposure to  endotoxin, (1-&gt;3)-b-D-glucan, and fungi. Woodworkers showed significant positive correlations between percentage cross-shift change (decrease) in  lung function and respiratory symptoms. Significant inverse correlations were also found among percentage predicted lung function and respiratory symptoms.  The elevated inhalable dust exposures observed in this study can be explained by a combination of factors, including:  lack of awareness of potential health effects of wood dust exposure among both management and workers, aging equipment,  inadequate and ineffective dust extraction systems or usually none especially for hand held tools, poor maintenance of the  ventilation system in some, non-segregation of dusty processes, dry sweeping, and the use of compressed air jets.  The determinant-of-exposure analysis confirmed the field observations. The significant determinants of personal inhalable dust exposures (n=163)  were found to be: local exhaust ventilation, job title, use of hand-held tools, cleaning method used, use of compressed air, and green or dry wood processed.  Type of wood processed was not found to be statistically significant. A majority of workers (~90%) did not wear appropriate respirators approved for wood dust, while the workers who did wear them, used them on average less than 50% of the time.  Workers should be protected by controlling dust at its source.  When exposure to wood dust cannot be avoided, engineering controls should be supplemented with the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wood dust, endotoxin glucans, determinant of exposures, lung function, work related symptoms, dose response relationships</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's Selection and Evaluation of Obstetric Hospitals: A Survey of the Northern Sydney Area.</field><field name="creator">Boyes, Allison Wendy</field><field name="description">A study of women's views of maternity services in the Northern Sydney Area Health Service was conducted as a result of the changing patterns of use of the Area's 7 obstetric hospitals. 340 primiparous women living in the Northern Sydney Area who had given birth in the previous six months were approached in Early Childhood Health Centres and asked to complete a survey exploring the factors influencing their choice of obstetric hospital, postnatal length of stay in hospital, and overall satisfaction with their choice of hospital. Of the 315 eligible women, 312 (99%) consented to participate and 297 (94%) completed the survey. Overall, reputation of the hospital and quality of nursing care were the most frequent reasons given for choice of hospital and there was some evidence that women selected different hospitals for distinct reasons. Women's postnatal length of stay ranged from less than 1 day to 11 days with an average of 5.3 days. Private patients stayed an average of 1 day longer than public patients, after adjusting for delivery type and pregnancy induced hypertension. There was little evidence that women in the Northern Sydney Area Health Service desire a shorter postnatal stay with the majority of women reporting they were satisfied with their length of stay. Overall, women displayed high levels of satisfaction with their choice of hospital; at least 90% of women attending all hospitals except one reported that they would choose the same hospital for the birth of another baby.

This thesis is also concerned with two very important classes of receptors which bind amino acids in the brain: firstly, the inhibitory GABA receptor, which binds g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (2) in vivo, and for which muscimol (3) is an agonist of the GABAA subclass; secondly, Excitatory Amino Acid (EAA) receptors, which bind glutamate (4) in vivo, and in particular the AMPA subclass, for which (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) (5) is an agonist. The connection between pyridazinediones and amino acid  receptors is the design, synthesis, and evaluation of structures based on pyridazinediones as potential GABA and EAA receptor ligands. Techniques of theoretical chemistry, molecular modelling, synthetic chemistry, and in vitro pharmacology are used to explore pyridazine-3,6-dione derivatives as ligands.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pyridazine, pyridazinone, pyridazindione, gamma-aminobutyric acid, glutamate, GABA, excitatory amino acid, EAA, neurochemistry, synthesis, design, ab initio, semi-empirical, AMPA, NMDA, NBS, tautomerism, heterocyclic, heterocycle, chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Just Little Things': Nurses' perceptions of quality of life for people with severe multiple impairments.</field><field name="creator">Atkins, Chris</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Notions of quality of life dictate philosophies and policies for services for people with  developmental disabilities.  There is an abundance of research on quality of life, much of which has influenced the significant amount of study of  quality of life for people with developmental disabilities.  According to specialist developmental disability nurses, however,  this research has little meaning for one group of people with developmental disabilities with whom they work - people  with severe multiple impairments.  Nevertheless, judgements and decisions about the lives of this group continue to be  driven by the idea of quality of life.  While the literature review found that researchers are urged to seek the perceptions of people  regarding their own quality of life by asking them, some authors have noted the difficulty in pursuing such a method with people,  such as people with severe multiple impairments, who are unable to communicate in the usual ways.  Given, then, that it is  difficult to directly determine the views of people with severe multiple impairments, this study sought the perceptions of  nurses about the quality of life of the people with whom they work. In order to discover and conceptualise nurses' views,  a symbolic interaction perspective was chosen to guide this study and data were analysed using the grounded theory approach.   The study was conducted in two stages.   Stage One consisted of semi-structured indepth interviews with expert nurses to explore their perceptions of quality of life  for the people with whom they worked.  A significant finding in these interviews was that perceptions of quality of life are mediated by interaction.   Consequently, Stage Two involved a participant observation study in which the interactions of nurses and people with severe multiple impairments were examined. Specialist developmental disability nurses have a unique view of quality of life for people with severe multiple impairments.   They refer to it as 'just little things', a phrase which masks complex nursing knowledge and skills, and which can be described by four  interrelated categories which emerged from the data:  humans being, supporting, becoming intimate, and situated belonging.   As nurses become more intimate with individuals, they perceive that people with severe multiple impairments are  humans being as they wish, and that quality resides in supporting their everyday lives in a context of situated belonging. This thesis represents a new conceptualisation of quality of life for people with severe multiple impairments,  a conceptualisation which may have significance for other groups and, indeed, for the whole quality of life enterprise.   This conceptualisation draws on knowledge not usually related to quality of life, that is, knowledge of the body, of the emotions,  of identity and of humanness. Such findings demonstrate the power of an interpretive approach in explicating the meanings nurses  have regarding quality of life.  Further, these findings have implications for how the question of quality of life is approached,  for how different ways of thinking about people impact on quality of life, and for the importance of the life in quality of life.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of life, symbolic interaction, grounded theory, disability, communication, nurse patient relationship</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/395</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic Homonymy and the Structure of Morphological Categories: Some Lessons from Paradigm Geometry</field><field name="creator">Johnston, Jason Clift</field><field name="description">This thesis takes as its starting point proposals to model inflectional paradigms as geometrical structures, wherein systematic homonymies are constrained to occupy contiguous regions. It defines a precise criterion for assessing systematicity and shows, for a range of largely Indo-European and Afro-Asiatic data, that such models are observationally adequate in modelling systematic homonymies within a single inflectional dimension, and to a lesser extent, between different inflectional dimensions. This is taken to indicate that widely assumed characterizations of inflectional categories in terms of cross-classifying binary features are incorrect, inasmuch as such characterizations fail to predict the linearizability of natural classes of properties belonging to those categories. The same inadequacy besets attempts to account for systematic homonymies by means of rules that convert or 'refer' one morpho-syntactic representation to another.     Rather it is argued that the linearizability of natural classes of properties suggests that inflectional categories are structured as a sub-classification of those properties, but that a phenomenon of 're-marking' serves to define, under strict constraints, additional natural classes beyond those defined by the sub-classification itself. The specific sub- classifications indicated by observed patterns of homonymy are language-specific. In addition, the properties so sub-classified under a single node may in certain cases be drawn from separate morpho-syntactic categories. This is taken to indicate that the terminal nodes of a morphological sub-classification are not morpho-syntactic feature complexes but purely morphological functions performing a discontinuous mapping between morpho-syntactic and morpho-phonological representations. The systematicity of homonymy patterns, then, is shown to be evidence for a linguistic level of 'pure morphology'.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">morphology homonymy paradigm geometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'SIDERE MENS EADEM MUTATO': NINETEENTH-CENTURY ART COLLECTIONS AND ARCHITECTURAL STYLE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY</field><field name="creator">BELL, Pamela</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to examine the nineteenth-century art collections and architectural style of the original buildings  at the University of Sydney in order to demonstrate ways in which visual material may be employed to shape public perception of an institution.   I shall argue that the architectural style of the original university buildings was specifically chosen with particular aims which extended  beyond the mere establishment of a tertiary institution for the colony.  I will also argue that the style shaped the character of the institution,  contributed to the maintenance of law and order in the colony, linked the colony more firmly than hitherto to the mother country and provided social  benefits for the founders of the institution. The instant history and character thus imposed upon the institution was reinforced by the assembly of a portrait collection in emulation  of other collections of portraits at leading institutions of the colony and the mother country, including the Oxbridge universities.   Once the building proclaimed that the institution was comparable with the great universities of the world, the subjects of the portraits  at the university could be placed in the class of founders of a great historical institution, thus at the same time enhancing the reputation  of the institution and the individuals. The construction of an indentity through visual images was extended by the benefactions of Sir Charles Nicholson,  the principal donor of works of art to the university in the nineteenth century.  I argue that his intentions in  relation to his collections were didactic but were also concerned with the entrenchment of the imperial hegemony over  the colony, and again with the enhancement of his personal repuatation.  This analysis shows how, by a complex of  personal ambition and aspiration for the colony, the style of the buildings and the art collections formed were used to establish the  colony as civilized and the new university as a bastion of English tradition.</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Sydney, nineteenth century, art, collection, architecture, Nicholson, Sir Charles Nicholson, buildings, colony, portrait, institution</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WOMEN AND MARRIAGE: THE HOUSING CONSEQUENCES OF OPTING OUT</field><field name="creator">YOUNG, Coral</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the housing-related implications of separation and divorce for women.   It arges that the housing circumstances must be placed within a broader perspective of the social and economic consequences and  ideological environment surrounding divorce.  In the same way, operation of the housing system must be placed within a wider context,  particularly in relation to the degree of change in its operational environment within the last 20 years. The thesis finds that the circumstances surrounding leaving a marriage are personally traumatic,  and lead to a period of economic, housing and personal crisis.  Over time, although the tendency is for establishment of re-equlibrium,  considerable disadvantages prevail for women.  The quickest method of establishing re-equilibrium for women is to repartner.</field><field name="date">1993</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women, marriage, divorce, seperation, housing, social consequences, income</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Barrels, jets and smoke-rings: Understanding  the bizarre shapes of radio supernova remnants</field><field name="creator">Gaensler, Bryan Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the various morphologies of radio supernova  remnants (SNRs), and attempts to determine whether their appearance  results from the properties of the progenitor star and its supernova  explosion, or from the structure of the interstellar medium (ISM) and  ambient magnetic field into which a SNR consequently expands.  High-resolution observations of Supernova 1987A show a young remnant  whose appearance and evolution are completely dominated by the  structure of its progenitor wind.  A statistical study of the Galactic  population of bilateral SNRs demonstrates that the symmetry axes of  these remnants run parallel to the Galactic Plane. This result can be  explained by the interaction of main sequence stellar wind-bubbles with  the ambient magnetic field; expansion of SNRs into the resulting  elongated cavities results in a bilateral appearance with the observed  alignment. Radio observations of SNR G296.8-00.3 show a double-ringed  morphology which is best explained by expansion either into an  anisotropic main-sequence progenitor wind or into multiple cavities in  the ISM. Data on SNRs G309.2-00.6 and G320.4-01.2 (MSH 15-52) make a  strong case that the appearance of both remnants is significantly  affected by collimated outflows from a central source; for G309.2-00.6  the source itself is not detected, but for G320.4-01.2 there is now  compelling evidence that the remnant is associated with and is  interacting with the young pulsar PSR B1509-58.  I conclude that, while  the youngest SNRs are shaped by their progenitor's circumstellar  material, the appearance of most SNRs reflects the properties of the  local ISM and magnetic field.  Remnants which interact with an  associated pulsar or binary system appear to be rare, and are easily  distinguished by their unusual and distorted morphologies.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">astronomy, astrophysics, supernovae, supernova remnants, pulsars, neutron stars</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AN EVALUATION OF BANK CREDIT POLICIES FOR FARM LOAN PORTFOLIOS USING THE SIMULATION APPROACH</field><field name="creator">Bramma, Keith Michael</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to evaluate the risk-return efficiency of credit policies for managing portfolio credit risk of banking institutions.  The focus of the empirical analysis is on the impact of risk pricing and problem loan restructuring on bank risk and returns using a simulation model that represents an operating environment of lenders servicing the Australian farm sector.  Insurance theory principles and agency relationships between a borrower and a lender are integrated into the portfolio theory framework.  The portfolio theory framework is then couched in terms of the capital budgeting approach to generate a portfolio return distribution function for a particular credit policy regime.  Borrowers are segmented by region, industry, loan maturity and credit risk class.  Each credit risk class defines risk constraints on which a stochastic simulation model may be developed for credit scoring an average borrower in a portfolio segment.  The stochastic simulation method is then used to generate loan security returns for a particular credit policy regime through time with loan return outcomes weighted by the number of borrowers in a segment to give measures of portfolio performance.  Stochastic dominance efficiency criteria are used to choose between distributions of NPV of bank returns measured for a number of credit policy alternatives.  The findings suggest that banks servicing the Australian farm sector will earn more profit without additional portfolio risk if the maximum limit to which pricing accounts for default risk in loan reviews is positively linked to volatility of gross incomes of farm business borrowers.  Importantly, credit-underwriting standards must also be formulated so as to procure farm business borrowers of above average productivity with loans that are fully secured using fixed assets.  The results of simulations also suggest that restructuring loans in event of borrower default provide for large benefits compared to a &#65533;no restructuring&#65533; option.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Credit risk, credit policy, portfolio theory, farm loans, simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE BATTLE OF THE SEXES IN SCIENCE FICTION: FROM THE PULPS TO THE JAMES TIPTREE, JR.

However, for many years the vast literature on eugenics focused almost exclusively on the history of eugenics in Britain and America. While some aspects of eugenics in Australia are now being documented, the history of this movement largely remained to be written. Australians experienced both fears and hopes at the time of Federation in 1901. Some feared that the white population was declining and degenerating but they also hoped to create a new utopian society which would outstrip the achievements, and avoid the poverty and industrial unrest, of Britain and America. Some responded to these mixed emotions by combining notions of efficiency and progress with eugenic ideas about maximising the growth of a white population and filling the "empty spaces". It was hoped that by taking these actions Australia would avoid "racial suicide" or Asian invasion and would improve national fitness, thus avoiding "racial decay" and starting to create a "paradise of physical perfection". This thesis considers the impact of eugenics in Australia by examining three related propositions: 1. that from the 1910s to the 1930s, eugenic ideas in Australia were readily accepted because of concerns about declining birth rate; 2. that, while mainly derivative, Australian eugenics had several distinctive Australian qualities; 3. that eugenics has a legacy in many disciplines, particularly family planning and public health.  This examination of Australian eugenics is primarily from the perspective of the people, publications and organisations which contributed to this movement in the first half of this century. In addition to a consideration of their achievements, reference is also made to the influence which eugenic ideas had in such diverse fields as education, immigration, law, literature, politics, psychology and science.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcoholism, Australia, Baby Bonus, Birth Rate, Child Healt, Yellow Peril Degeneracy, Eugenics, Eugenist, Family Planning, Feeble-minded, Feminism, genetics, infant mortality, marriage certificates, maternal mortality, mental defectives, migration, naturv</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE GRANDEST IMPROVEMENT IN THE COUNTRY: AN HISTORICAL AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDY OF  THE GREAT NORTH ROAD, N.S.W., 1825-1836</field><field name="creator">KARSKENS, Grace</field><field name="description">The line of road originally intended to link Sydney with the booming settlements of the  Hunter Valley underwent a ten year survey and construction period, beginning in 1825 with Heneage Finch's hastily selected,  winding line, and ending in 1836 with two small road gangs caught in a continuous cycle of construction and decay.   In the interim period, however, the road had aroused the enthusiasm of the best surveyors and engineers available in the colony.   These men envisioned a fine, all-encompassing, permanent thoroughfare - a most appropriate goal in view of the contemporary optimism  with regard to the colony's future.  The structures and formations were impressive and etensive and built as far as possible according  to the latest principles emerging from the road building revolution in Britain.  The methods were, of necessity, simplified in  response to the colonial conditions of rugged terrain, vast distances and the large but unskilled and, for the main part,  unwilling convict labour force.  The results were highly successful, as is stille vident today, and never failed to impress  early travellers and reassure them that they were, after all, in a 'civilised' country.  The road never actually fulfilled  its builders' plans.  A steamboat service established between Sydney and the Hunter Valley robbed it of its role as a vital link,  and other more hospitable or more direct routes were discovered and used by what traffic did proceed on land.   After the few remaining gangs were finally withdrawn, seciton after section quickly fell into disuse and abandonment.   Both the grand and modest structures and formations were left neglected, and thus preserved, to the present day.</field><field name="date">1985</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">great north road, great, north road, NSW, N.S.W, 1825-1836, study, construction, survey</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE WILL OF THE POEM: Religio-Imaginative Variations in the Poetry of James McAuley, Francis Webb, and Vincent Buckley</field><field name="creator">ROWE, Noel Michael</field><field name="description">While considering the work of James McAuley, Francis Webb and Vincent Buckley,  this thesis concentrates on the religious character of their poetry. Since it assumes that religious language is primarily metaphorical  (as distinct from dogmatic), the thesis describes the poetry by way  of its religio-imaginative relationships and structures.  James McAuley's poetry is religious, not so much because it is Catholic,  as because it voyages between despair and hope, believing always in the reasoned will.   Francis Webb's poetry, continually discovering glory in dereliction, dramatises the revelatory and redeeming power of the rejected ones -  and so works within the 'Suffering Servant' model of 'Isaiah'.  While Vincent Buckley's poetry gradually abandons Catholic language  in favour of its own 'idiom of sensation', the religious quality of that sensation is discovered more in liminal than in paradisal  possibilities - in the way 'holy spaces' are always in some sense expatriate ones.  Since each of these poets belongs in the period  of Vatican II Catholicism, the thesis next relates their work to that context.  Here, however, it searches for imaginative connections  and disconnections by setting up its comparison on the basis, not of dogmas, but of models.  Finally, the thesis interprets Webb's  'Eyre All Alone' as a search for renewed religious language, returning to its opening assumption that religious language is primarily metaphorical.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">poem, poetry, McAuley, Webb, Buckley, religion, religious, religious language, Catholic, metaphorical</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ROCKS AND SYDNEY: SOCIETY, CULTURE AND MATERIAL LIFE 1788-C1830</field><field name="creator">KARSKENS, Grace</field><field name="description">This study explores the early history of Sydney's Rocks area at two levels.   First, it provides a much-needed history of the city's earliest, oldest-surviving and best-known precinct,  one which allows an investigation of popular beliefs about the Rocks' convict origins, and which challenges  and qualifies its reputation for lowlife, vice and squalor. Second, by examining fundamental aspects of everyday life -  townscape, community and commonality, family life and work, human interaction and rites of passage -  this study throws new light on the origins of Sydney from the perspective of the convict and ex-convict majority.   Despite longstanding historical interest in Sydney's beginnings, the cultural identity, values, habits, beliefs  of the convicts and ex-convicts remained largely hidden.  The examination of such aspects reveals another Sydney  altogether from that presented by governors, artists and mapmakers.  Instead of an orderly oupost of empire, a gaol-town,  or a 'gulag', the Sydney the Rocks represents was built and occupied largely according  to the tastes, priorities and inclination of the people, with relatively little official regulation or interference.   While the Rocks appeared 'disorderly' in the eyes of the elite, it nevertheless functioned according to cultural rules,  those of the lower orders - the artisans, shopkeepers, publicans, labouring people, the majority of whom were convicts  and ex-convicts.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">The Rocks, Rocks, Sydney, convicts, ex-convicts, settlers, history, culture, 1788-1830, Australia, colony, community, town, people</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy in Tumor Pathology</field><field name="creator">Rekas, Agata</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer, differentiation, NMR, colon cell lines</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creators, Creatures and Victim-Survivors: Word, Silence and Some Humane Voices of Self-Determination from the Wycliffe Bible of 1388 to the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights 1993.</field><field name="creator">Keable, Penelope Susan</field><field name="description">This analysis of apocalyptic rhetoric brings nine generations of the written text of the Johannine Apocalypse into a contemporary (1989-1994) framework which includes phenomena such as self-determination, mutual interdependence and psychoterror.

The thesis is a description and examination of the phonology, prosody, and morphology of Ngalakgan, based on several years of fieldwork. Ngalakgan is a language with a rich inventory of classically Gunwinyguan morphological features, including noun class agreement for all major and some minor word classes, compounding of both nouns and verbs, and a rich array of modifying and inflectional prefixes and suffixes. In Ngalakgan, there is a distinction between two kinds or 'levels' of morphology: 'root'-level and 'word'-level. Root-level morphology is lexicalised and unproductive. It is restricted to the tense/aspect/mood inflection of the small closed class of 'finite' verb roots, and to the large closed class of compounds of these roots. Word-level morphology is productive, and includes almost all prefixes, all (non-tensed) suffixes and all clitics. Only word-level structure is consistently reflected in prosodic structure; forms which are complex only at the root-level are treated as prosodic units. I show that all word-level morphemes constitute prosodic domains: every word-level stem, affix and clitic potentially begins a new domain for metrical foot structure. Geminates and glottal stops are over-represented at morpheme boundaries in complex words. In addition, they are subject to complex, non-local alternations with simple stops and zero, respectively, in Ngalakgan and related languages. The alternations are conditioned by preceding geminates and voiceless obstruent clusters, as well as by prosodic and morphological structure. I propose that voiceless obstruent clusters constitute 'boundary signals' to morphological structure, in a similar fashion to stress and, like stress, are 'licensed' by the organisation of intonation. Ngalakgan displays a quantitive-sensitive stress system in roots which is apparently unique to languages of this area. Heavy syllables in Ngalakgan are those which are articulatorily and perceptually complex: those in which the coda is followed by a consonant with a distinct place of articulation. Geminates, homorganic nasal+stop clusters and glottal stops interact with this distinction in ways which are not predicted by current prosodic theories.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linguistics, Australian Aboriginal languages, morphology, prosody, phonology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Charles Dickens and the Role of Legal Institutions in Social and Moral Reform: Oliver Twist, Bleak House, and Our Mutual Friend.</field><field name="creator">Swifte, Yasmine Gai</field><field name="description">The legal system of Victorian England is integral to Charles Dickens' novels and to their moral intent.    Dickens was acutely conscious of the way in which the Victorian novel operated as a form of moral art.    As a novelist he is concerned about the victims of his society and the way in which their lots can be improved.   He therefore chooses to construct representative victims of legal institutions such as the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834 and the Court of Chancery in his  novels to highlight flaws in his world and the changes that might be made to improve social conditions. This thesis will examine the way in which Dickens'  fictional enquiry into the social world his characters stand to inherit is focused on the legal system and its institutions, most particularly,  the law of succession.  By discussing three novels from different periods of his writing career, Oliver Twist (1837), Bleak House (1853) and  Our Mutual Friend (1862-1865), I will suggest how his engineering of moral outcomes shows his development as a writer.   The law of succession and related legal institutions such as the Court of Chancery, dealing with wills and inheritance,  recurs in Dickens' novels, providing the novelist with social, moral and legal identities for his characters.   These identities, as unveiled during the texts, propel the characters and plot development in particular directions in response to the novels' moral intent. The role of inheritance in Victorian society largely provides Dickens with a means to explore the adequacies of existing legal institutions,  such as the means by which to prove and execute wills and the operation of the Court of Chancery.  The role of inheritance also allows Dickens to examine the social condition of those who are deprived of an inheritance or who are  unable to enforce their legal rights.  In this respect Dickens concentrates on the appalling conditions of institutions such as workhouses  and poorhouses in Victorian society and on resultant criminal activity and prostitution in the community as the disinherited struggle to survive.   Dickens' study of crime in particular sheds invaluable light on the prevailing moral standards of, and difficulties with, his society.   Dickens acknowledges his pedagogical role as an author, providing synopses of his lessons in the prefaces to his books and  forewarning his audience of the literary devices (such as grotesquerie) that are necessary to communicate them effectively. This thesis will examine the way in which Dickens' engineering of moral outcomes through the convenient use of the  law of succession becomes increasingly sophisticated as he develops as a writer.   The stock plot device of the impoverished orphan child, a representative victim of such a Victorian legal institution as the Poor Laws  who is morally saved when elevated into gentility by a secret inheritance, sustains the plot of Oliver Twist.  The simplistic and somewhat improbable fortunes of Oliver, however, give way to the more probable moral and legal outcomes of characters  such as Jo and Richard Carstone in Bleak House.  In Bleak House Carstone, who is certainly a more interesting central protagonist than Esther Summerson  in terms of Dickens' examination of legal institutions and their effect on moral and social outcomes in the novel, makes a ruinous attempt to  manipulate the legal system and gain control over his fortune by joining the suit of Jarndyce v Jarndyce.  In Our Mutual Friend, however, a  complex and successful manipulation of the legal system is achieved by Harmon/Handford/Rokesmith, an adult and extremely resourceful character  who, in conjunction with other characters such as Bella Wilfer and Mr Boffin, is testament to the inseparability of individual and legal identities  as far as moral and social outcomes are concerned.   Throughout the novels it can be seen that the abilities of Oliver Twist,  Richard Carstone and John Rokesmith to manipulate the law of succession correlate directly to stages of Dickens' maturity  as a writer and his increasing confidence about layering texts and developing more complex and sophisticated structures in his novels. Dickens' focus on the role of inheritance, however, entails the development of perspectives on the legal system in entirety.  Oliver Twist as a novel drawing upon the traditions of sensation, and turning on events such as 'legacies, birthrights, thefts and deeds of violence',  focuses intensely on the criminal justice system and establishes Dickens' famous attraction to repulsion and use of grotesquerie and popular entertainment.   Oliver Twist also develops analogies between law and drama, establishing the foundation from which  Dickens can employ legal metaphors to great effect in his quest for reforms of the legal system and society at large in Bleak House and Our Mutual Friend.  Oliver Twist further establishes the milieu of a stratified society in which finances govern social behaviour and in which the class system is  reflected in the legal system through the denial of access to justice to those who are unable to afford it, or suffer gender inequality. Bleak House builds upon the problems outlined in Oliver Twist.  It explores the criminal system, particularly the defeminisation of the law and access to  justice issues, including the problem of delay in litigation.  Specific legal institutions such as the jury system and, most notably,  the civil branch of the Victorian legal system with a particular focus on the equitable procedures in the Court of Chancery are examined.  Jo is a transmutation of Oliver as representative victim of the Poor Laws, and his fate as such appears more probable.  Richard Carstone is, however, the central character in the novel in terms of his construction as the representative victim of the civil system  and of the law of succession. In Our Mutual Friend Dickens refines his use of the law of succession and other legal institutions to  propel characters into directions suited to his own agendas. The entire plot is constructed from the premise of the execution of a  will arising out of the death of John Harmon whose murder is a crime that has never, in fact, been committed.   The ramifications of the execution of this will and subsequent codicils are extremely interesting.   The novel further examines problems of access to justice and gender inequality under the prevailing legal system, particularly through Bella Wilfer. As part of the development of Dickens' use of the legal system there is a perceptible development of his powers of characterisation.   Richard Carstone is a more substantial and believable character than Oliver; John Harmon offers the opportunity for Dickens to experiment with a  chameleon identity.  This aspect of Dickens' development, however, has received substantial attention already, particularly by Arnold Kettle,  Barbara Hardy, Monroe Engel and Grahame Smith.  There has been, to the best of my knowledge, little work done on his use of the law of succession,  and it is here that I wish to concentrate my argument. Much of Dickens' interest in the law appears to stem from his early career as a legal clerk  in Lincoln's Inn and Doctors' Commons.  His first job, as a writing clerk in the office of Ellis and Blackmore, a small set of chambers in Holborn Court,  involved duties such as copying documents, administering the registration of wills and running errands to other legal offices and law courts.   Public offices with which Dickens came into contact in the course of this job were the Alienation Office, the Sixpenny Receivers Office, the  Prothonotaries Office, the Clerk of the Escheats, the Dispensation Office, the Affidavit Office, the Filazer's, Exigenter's and Clerk of the Outlawry's Office,  the Hanaper Office and the Six-Clerk's office .  This employment gave Dickens an exposure to a wide range of jurisdictions and legal precedents.   Through this contact with a variety of legal practices, Dickens experienced a broad range of litigation which enabled him to develop opinions on the  contemporary operation of the law and its efficacy in the administration of justice.  Such experience almost certainly sowed the seeds for  much of the critique of the legal system found in his novels. In 1829 when he joined Doctors Commons, Dickens was exposed to ecclesiastical and  naval jurisdictions including a Consistory Court, A Court of Arches, the Prerogative Court, the Delegates Court and the Admiralty Court.   In this role Dickens was employed by a firm of proctors to take notes on evidence and judgments. This job as a shorthand reporter granted Dickens the  opportunity to observe at close range members of the legal profession such as clerks, proctors, secretaries and Doctors.   Probably as much through a process of osmosis as anything else, Dickens gained an understanding of the mechanics of basic  legal procedures through this type of employment.  In order to work as a court reporter, Dickens was required to use shorthand,  a method of taking notes that perhaps allowed Dickens to develop the skill to think and write quickly. It was probably at this  early stage in his career that the duality of law and literature began to come together for Dickens, developing at a later stage  into his volumes of legal fiction.  The anonymity of the law writer's existence, as captured later in Dickens' description of Nemo  the law-writer in Bleak House, who either lived or did not live by law-writing according to Krook, also may have prompted Dickens to  begin writing original works with legal themes.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Charles Dickens, Law, Criminal Procedures, Equity, Literature.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders: relations between psychosocial factors, symptoms and sensorimotor disturbances</field><field name="creator">Bennett, Ethelle Jeanette</field><field name="description">Although a vast literature attests to the belief that psychosocial disturbance is an important component of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), the relation of life stress, psychological distress and personality to the development of these disorders is poorly understood.  The broad objective of this thesis is to provide data on relations between psychosocial factors and FGID, especially irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional dyspepsia (FD), in representative outpatient samples.  Issues not previously addressed are examined in a series of studies. The first two studies are concerned with relations between psychosocial factors, extraintestinal (somatic) symptoms and the number and type of FGID syndromes present at consultation and, in IBS patients, the prospective relation of psychosocial factors to changes in symptom intensity over 16 months.  The last three studies relate psychosocial factors to gastrointestinal (GI) transit, motor, and sensory function in FGID, abnormalities in these parameters representing the putative origin of symptoms in FGID.  In total, 350 patients participated, representing a 95% participation rate.   Important features of the methodology include the use of a recently standardised symptom-based classification system for FGID, an objective and reliable interview-based life stress instrument (The Life Events and Difficulties Schedule), and sophisticated and sensitive technologies to assess GI transit, motor and sensory function. Novel measures, which conceptually take into account the chronic, fluctuating and recurrent course of IBS and FD syndromes, and the tendency of these syndromes to coexist, are also included.  Thus, measures of symptom outcome assess the number of syndromes present, while the symptom intensity variable reflects the severity and frequency of both FD and IBS symptoms, if both are present.  Similarly, with respect to altered transit, and motor and sensory function, physiological outcome variables reflect not only the presence of an abnormality but the number of regions affected, and the type and number of abnormalities present.  Cross-sectional findings showed for the first time that psychosocial disturbance is associated with FGID symptomatology in a quantitative manner, that chronic life stress threat is central to this process and this stress-related process is a prominent feature of a particular group of syndromes (ie IBS/FD) defined primarily by the presence of pain and discomfort. A combination of psychological, social and biological factors combined to predict the number of FGID syndromes present at entry into the study. Prominent among them was an angry, reactive and anxious (neurotic) personality, chronic life stress threat, increased coping, poor emotional support and increased age. In addition to a greater number of FD/IBS syndromes, individuals with an anger-reactive response style had experienced more intense pain and discomfort, and displayed more complete sensorimotor disturbance.   Longitudinal data demonstrated (also for the first time) the strength, consistency and unequivocal direction of the relation of chronic threat to symptom intensity over time.  Almost all of the within subject variance in symptom intensity levels (assessed on 3 occasions over a 16 month period) was explained by the severity of chronic threat during the previous 6 months or more.  For 76% of IBS patients, the presence vs the absence of one or more highly threatening chronic stressors predicted with considerable precision, the long-term clinical outcome. Thus, no patient exposed to even one such stressor improved clinically (ie by at least 50%) over the follow-up period, while in contrast, all patients who improved clinically did so in the absence of such a stressor.  For 24% of patients, however, failure to improve clinically could not be explained by any psychological, social (including life stress) or demographic factor included in this study.  Key risk indicators of a poor outcome at 16 months were identified - chronic life stress threat, the severity of baseline GI symptomatology, and female gender.  Life stress is important because it alone determined the magnitude and direction of change in symptom intensity over time, while the severity of baseline GI symptomatology revealed the extent of improvement required to achieve a recovery, and female gender predicted the presence of a larger number of FD/IBS syndromes in women long-term. Widespread hypomotility, which was almost exclusive to women in this study, represents one factor that may inhibit improvement (or rate of improvement) for women over time.    Finally, these findings have identified a psychophysiological subgroup, with underlying psychosocial, motor (and perhaps also sensory) dysfunctions that are more specific for women than men, and which does not seem to be distinctive of any particular FGID subgroup.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">functional gastrointestinal disorders;life stress;psychological;symptoms;sensory and motor disturbances</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE ECOLOGY OF FERAL CATS, FELIS CATUS, IN OPEN FOREST IN NEW SOUTH WALES: INTERACTIONS WITH FOOD RESOURCES AND FOXES</field><field name="creator">MOLSHER, Robyn Lorraine</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT Despite increasing evidence for the impact of feral cats Felis catus on native fauna in Australia,  little is known of the ecology of cats, particularly factors that limit cat abundance.  The ecology of the feral cat in Australia is  represented by just 15 published studies on diet, only one of which has examined diet in relation to prey availability,  and one study of home range behaviour.  The red fox Vulpes vulpes is a significant pest to agriculture and native fauna  in Australia and widespread fox removals have been proposed by the Vertebrate Biocontrol Cooperative Research Centre (VBCRC).   However, there is concern that feral cats may increase compensatorily when fox populations are reduced, as has occurred in Western Australia,  and therefore that predation pressure may not be alleviated on native fauna following fox control programs.  This thesis is divided into two parts.   First, the diet and home range size of cats is examined in relation to prey availability, and home range overlap and habitat use are determined.   In the second part, several niche parameters (diet, home range and habitat use) that were potentially important resources for foxes and cats  were quantified to assess the potential for competition.  Avoidance and aggression between cats and foxes was examined using simultaneous  radiotracking techniques and video observations.  The hypothesis that foxes limit cats through interspecific competition  (exploitation and interference) was then tested using a fox removal experiment.   Finally, three further hypotheses were tested using a fox removal experiment to determine which factors limit feral cats at Burrendong.   The four hypotheses tested were thus: i) Cats are limited independently of foxes through other factors such as food availability;  ii) Foxes limit cats through interspecific competition (exploitation and/or interference); iii) Foxes limit cats through intraguild predation;  iv) Cats benefit from the presence of foxes through facilitation. The diets and spatial use of feral cats were examined on agricultural land on the eastern shore of Lake Burrendong,  New South Wales (32o40&#65533;S, 149o 10&#65533;E) between July 1994 and June 1997.  The major land use for the area is water catchment under the agistment of sheep Ovis aries and cattle Bos taurus.  The study area encompasses about 90 km2 of hilly terrain with undulating slopes that extend down to a flat foreshore area that has been extensively cleared of trees for grazing.  The slopes are generally well timbered and dominated by white box Eucalyptus albens woodlands with some yellow box E.  melliodora associations.  Stands of cyprus pines Callitris spp. are also common.  Feral cats and red foxes are established throughout the study area, and the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus was abundant until the arrival of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease (RCD) in June 1996.  The diet of feral cats was determined from the analysis of 499 scats.   Rabbits were the staple prey of cats, with occurrence (O) in 81.6% of scats and comprising 68.4% by volume (V).  Carrion (mostly eastern grey kangaroo Macropus giganteus and sheep) (O 21.5%, V 11.5%) was an important secondary food, particularly in winter and spring.  Other mammalian prey included brushtail possums Trichosurus vulpecula (O 4.6%, V 2.4%), house mice Mus domesticus (O 6.2%, V 3.2%), black rats Rattus rattus (O 2.6%, V 1.4%) and a dunnart Sminthopsis sp. (probably S. murina) (O 0.2%, V 0.006%).  Invertebrates (mostly Orthopterans) (O 41.5%, V 7.5%), vegetation (O 26.3%, V 3.6%), birds (O 4.2%, V 0.8%) and reptiles (O 3.4%, V 0.3%) were generally of minor importance in the diet.  Few significant seasonal differences were found, although invertebrates contributed significantly less, and possums more, to the mean scat volume in winter and summer respectively.    A significant dietary response was found for changes in rabbit abundance, but not for the other prey groups.   Cats continued to prey heavily on rabbits after the arrival of Rabbit Calicivirus Disease, despite the relatively low numbers of rabbits.   Ten months post-RCD, house mice increased in importance in the diet.   However, it was not known whether this represented prey switching sensu stricto or opportunistic predation on an increased mouse population, as mouse abundance was not measured during this period.  Seventy-seven cats (48 recaptures) were caught in 6762 trap nights between November 1994 and August 1996 using both cage traps and leg-hold traps.  A further 18 individual cats were trapped as non-target animals by the VBCRC Fox Sterility Project and used in this study.   Trapped adult cats were fitted with radio collars and their home range size, overlap and habitat use examined.   Home ranges and core areas were quantified using 95% and 50% kernel utilisation distributions (KE 95 and KE 50)  and minimum convex polygons (MCP 100, MCP 95, MCP 50).  Four habitat types (grassland, open woodland, open forest, and mudflats)  were delineated on aerial photographs and a habitat map produced using ARC/INFO.   Compositional analysis was used to examine habitat preference in cats. Home range sizes of cats (n = 15, 598 fixes) in winter 1995, prior to fox removal,  were similar to those reported in the only published study of cat spatial use in Australia,  but larger than those recorded elsewhere.  This may have reflected more dispersed food resources in Australia,  although home range size was not correlated significantly with rabbit abundance.  Male ranges (MCP 95   = 284 ha, n = 11)  tended to be larger than females (  = 151ha, n = 4), but no differences were detected between young (1-3 years,   = 271ha, n = 7)  and old (&gt;3 years,   = 221ha, n = 8) cats.  Cats were active both by day and night with no temporal differences being detected in range size.   Both adult male and female cats tended to be solitary, although home ranges overlapped extensively.   Kin groups were indicated (but not confirmed) as most inter-sexual overlap occurred between young and old cats.  Habitat composition of home ranges generally reflected the availability of habitats at the study site,  although cats significantly avoided mudflats.  Home ranges comprised mostly open woodland and open forest habitats  with smaller areas of grassland and mudflats.  However, within individual home ranges, cats used grassland and open woodland habitats  most often where rabbits were more abundant.  Inter-individual (sex, age) or temporal (day/night) differences in habitat use were not detected. Comparison of resource use between cats and foxes indicated a large overlap in diet, home ranges and habitat use.   Dietary breadths and overlaps between cats and foxes increased when rabbit availability declined in autumn and post-RCD.   Dietary overlap was high overall (75%), although some resource partitioning was detected.   Rabbits were more important in the diet of cats than foxes, particularly in summer, when foxes ate more grasshoppers.   Carrion, invertebrates and vegetation were more important for foxes than for cats overall.   Home ranges of both cats and foxes comprised mostly open woodland habitats followed by grassland, open forest and mudflats,  which largely reflected their relative availabilities.  However, within individual home ranges, cats showed a  preference for grassland habitats.  In addition, cats tended to deposit scats more often than foxes at rabbit warrens and at hollow log entrances,  while foxes deposited scats more often than cats on sand plots, tracks and at dams.   The large overlap in resource use between cats and foxes indicated a high potential for exploitation competition. Foxes may attempt to lessen competition by killing cats (interference competition).   Three radiocollared cats were killed by foxes and aggression was observed toward cats.   Home ranges overlapped extensively, but avoidance was indicated from the simultaneous radiotracking of both predators,  as greater separations and lower overlaps in home ranges and core areas were recorded between species than within species.   In addition, video observations suggested avoidance of carcasses by cats in the presence of foxes.  The hypothesis that foxes limit feral cats through interspecific competition was then tested using a fox removal experiment.   Foxes were reduced at two of the four sites from October 1995 using &#65533;1080&#65533; baiting and spotlight shooting by the VBCRC Predator-Prey project.   Resource use and abundance of cats were compared before and after fox removal and between treated and untreated sites.   Although no increase in cat abundance followed the removal of foxes, significant behavioural changes by cats  strongly suggested interspecific competition operating via exploitation and interference.   Exploitation competition was supported by the increased consumption of carrion by cats at the treated sites after fox removal,  while support for interference competition came from the increased use of grassland habitats at night after fox removal.   The direction of the resource shifts to more prey-rich habitats indicated asymmetry in the relationship between the two predator species.   Although the null hypothesis of no limitation of cats by foxes could not be rejected, as  no increase in cat abundance was recorded after fox removal,  interspecific competition was considered to be the most likely mechanism limiting feral cats at Burrendong.   Intraguild predation was not indicated as no cat remains were found in any of the 343 fox scats or 255 fox stomachs that were examined.   In addition, minimal evidence was found for facilitation between cats and foxes, or for food limitation. The potential for foxes to limit cats, as shown in this study, indicates that cats need to be considered in future fox control operations.   Integrated pest management, where foxes, cats and rabbits are controlled together, is strongly proposed if the objective is to  safeguard native fauna in Australia.  Further research is required to improve the effectiveness of current techniques  for censusing cat populations, particularly in forested areas.  This is essential for monitoring the effectiveness of  control campaigns and quantifying factors that limit cat populations, and ultimately for effective protection of susceptible native fauna.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">feral cats, foxes, competition, predation, ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Application of the Inverse Scattering Transform to some Nonlinear Singular Integro-Differential Equations.</field><field name="creator">Scoufis, George</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT The quest to model wave propagation in various physical systems has produced  a large set of diverse nonlinear equations. Nonlinear singular integro-differential equations rank amongst the intricate  nonlinear wave equations available to study the classical problem of wave propagation in physical systems.  Integro-differential equations are characterized by the simultaneous presence of integration and differentiation in a single  equation. Substantial interest exists in nonlinear wave equations that are amenable to the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). The IST is an adroit mathematical technique that delivers analytical solutions of a certain type of nonlinear equation:  soliton equation. Initial value problems of numerous physically significant nonlinear equations have now been solved through  elegant and novel implementations of the IST. The prototype nonlinear singular integro-differential equation receptive to the IST is the Intermediate Long Wave (ILW) equation,  which models one-dimensional weakly nonlinear internal wave propagation in a density stratified fluid of finite total depth.  In the deep water limit the ILW equation bifurcates into a physically significant nonlinear singular integro-differential  equation known as the 'Benjamin-Ono' (BO) equation; the shallow water limit of the ILW equation is the famous Korteweg-de Vries  (KdV) equation. Both the KdV and BO equations have been solved by dissimilar implementations of the IST. The Modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation, which was  significant in the historical development of the IST. Solutions of the MKdV equation are mapped by an explicit  nonlinear transformation known as the 'Miura transformation' into solutions of the KdV equation. Historically,  the Miura transformation manifested the intimate connection between solutions of the KdV equation and the inverse  problem for the one-dimensional time independent Schroedinger equation. In light of the MKdV equation's significance, it is natural to seek 'modified' versions of the ILW and BO equations.  Solutions of each modified nonlinear singular integro-differential equation should be mapped by an analogue of the original  Miura transformation into solutions of the 'unmodified' equation. In parallel with the limiting cases of the ILW equation,  the modified version of the ILW equation should reduce to the MKdV equation in the shallow water limit and to the modified  version of the BO equation in the deep water limit. The Modified Intermediate Long Wave (MILW) and Modified Benjamin-Ono (MBO) equations are the two nonlinear singular  integro-differential equations that display all the required attributes.  Several researchers have shown that the MILW and MBO equations exhibit the signature characteristic of soliton equations.  Despite the significance of the MILW and MBO equations to soliton theory, and the possible physical applications of the  MILW and MBO equations, the initial value problems for these equations have not been solved. In this thesis we use the IST  to solve the initial value problems for the MILW and MBO equations on the real-line. The only restrictions that we place on  the initial values for the MILW and MBO equations are that they be real-valued, sufficiently smooth and decay to  zero as the absolute value of the spatial variable approaches large values.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inverse Scattering Transform, Nonlinear, Integro-Differential</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A NUMERICAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE MECHANISMS OF RESIDUAL STRESSES INDUCED BY SURFACE GRINDING</field><field name="creator">Mahdi, Mofid</field><field name="description">Abstract Grinding introduces unavoidable residual stresses of significant but unknown magnitudes.  The effect of residual stresses in surface integrity is related to the nature of the residual stresses which relies  purely on the process parameters and the workmaterial properties. It is a well-known fact that the fatigue strength of a  ground component is increased by introducing compressive stresses. On the other hand, fatigue cracks may originate at regions  of maximum tensile stress and usually at the surface of the material. Moreover, stress corrosion cracking is another consequence  of critical surface tensile stress. Added to that, the residual stresses may result in dimension alteration and surface distortion,  particularly for thin products such as plates. The beneficial effects of compressive residual stresses have been widely recognized in industry.  The wise application of such a principle would bring about improved economical use of parts subjected to fatigue loading  and aggressive environmental conditions.  Therefore a better understanding of residual stress mechanisms is necessary to increase the dimensional accuracy and improve the surface  integrity of ground elements, particularly for parts with high precision and manufactured by automated production lines.  Consequently, the development of reliable models for predicting residual stresses is of great value in reducing the amount of  measurements and experimental tests of residual stresses. Unfortunately, little effort has been devoted so far to develop appropriate models to take  into account grinding conditions, workmaterial properties and boundary conditions. This thesis aims to investigate the residual stress mechanisms induced by grinding in terms of grinding parameters.  In order to obtain a full understanding, both the roles of individual factors causing residual stresses (i.e. mechanical,  thermal and phase transformation) and their couplings were carefully studied with the aid of the finite element method. The studies include: (1) residual stresses due to thermal  grinding conditions, (2) residual stresses due to iso-thermal mechanical grinding conditions, (3) coupling of thermo-mechanical conditions, (4) coupling of thermo-phase transformation, and (5) the full coupling of all the factors.  It is found that under sole thermal grinding conditions, the heat flux associated with up-grinding may lead to a higher grinding temperature  compared with that of down-grinding. A constant flux introduces the least temperature rise if the total grinding energy is the same.  Higher convection heat transfer not only decreases the grinding temperature but also makes the temperature rise occur mainly within a  thin surface layer. A similar effect can be achieved by applying higher table speeds.  When the grinding temperature is less than the austensing temperature, surface residual stresses are tensile.  The heat generated within the grinding zone causes a very non-uniform temperature field in the workpiece.  The part of the workmaterial subjected to a higher temperature rise expands more significantly and causes compressive stresses because  of the restraint from its surrounding material that expands less. When the surface heat flux moves forward, the material outside the  grinding zone contracts under cooling. Since the workmaterial has been plastically deformed during thermal loading,  the contraction is restrained and thus a tensile stress field is generated locally. If a workpiece material experiences a critical temperature variation in grinding, phase transformation takes place and a  martensite layer appears in the immediate layer underneath the ground surface. It was found that the growth of martensite  develops a hardened zone with a higher yield stress that expands with the movement of the heat flux.  A tensile surface residual stress is then developed. When the volume growth of material takes place during phase change,  compressive residual stresses may also be generated. Under iso-thermal grinding conditions,  it was found that plane stress is mainly compressive regardless of the distribution of surface traction and the direction of  the tangential grinding force. With up-grinding, the residual stress in the grinding direction is always tensile.  However,  down-grinding may yield compressive surface residual stresses if the magnitude of the ratio of horizontal  to vertical grinding forces is sufficiently large. Moreover, it is noted that discrete surface traction, which is  more reasonable in terms of simulating the individual cutting of abrasive grits, would bring about more complex  residual stress distribution that is very sensitive to the combined effect of individual cutting grits. If thermal and mechanical grinding conditions are coupled, a state free from residual stresses may be achieved if  grinding heat is low and either the convection heat transfer or the table speed is high.  However, it is found that the full coupling of the mechanical deformation, the thermal deformation and deformation by  phase change results in tensile residual stresses. The effects of cooling and mechanical traction in this case however are minor. In summary, the research of this thesis explored the following: (a) grinding temperature development in terms of a wide range of  grinding parameters together with the effect of  temperature-dependent material properties, (b) the origin and onset of irreversible  deformation due to mechanical loading, thermal loading and phase change under critical grinding conditions, (c) the effects of individual  residual stress mechanisms and their partial and full couplings, and (d) the selection of grinding conditions to achieve beneficial residual stresses. Finally, based on the new findings in this research, a more comprehensive methodology is suggested for further study.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Grinding, Finite Element Method, Residual Stresses</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics, Justice and the Human Beyond Being.</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Elisabeth Louise</field><field name="description">Abstract: Emmanuel Levinas: Ethics, Justice and the Human beyond Being.  Levinas finds the early twentieth century to be marked by a rejection of the concept of humanity,  at the moment of its awakening to its own brutality.  While accepting the anti-humanist position,  insofar as it questions the primacy of free will, and an unquestionable security in its attachment to a pregiven,  universal Reason, Levinas' work questions the value of rethinking the human in terms of being.   This thesis traces Levinas' attempt to rehabilitate humanity from its devotion to ontology as first philosophy.   It argues that Levinas offers a reinterpretation of the relation of being and the human, tracing the movement in Levinas' work  from a critical attempt to rethink the human and being, to the notion of the human beyond being. The thesis begins with a critical engagement with Heideggerian ontology suggesting that Levinas' renewal  of the question of being in his prewar essays reflects a concern for the meaning of subjective existence  and its relation to the social and political totality.  These concerns lie behind his reinterpretation of  the relation of existence and the existent in his essays of the 1940's in which Levinas undertakes a critique  of a Platonic social totality and introduces a notion of the alterity of eros which does not have its value determined in  terms of a teleology of social production. From this basis, Levinas is shown to address the question of justice  by articulating the essentially ambiguous relation between the subject and another in terms of the ambivalence of the face,  and contrasting this with the alterity of love.  The development of these ideas is traced across Levinas' major works.  In Totality and Infinity, Levinas argues that the response to the singular other is conceived of as the event  of the production of a universal which affirms the tertiality of the social totality, that is, attests to the whole of humanity.   In Otherwise than Being, the relation of ethics and justice is discussed in different terms, those of the relation of the ethical Saying and the realm of the Said or being's justice.  Levinas juxtaposes the ontological tertiality of the third, with the notion of an ethical tertiality, which he calls illeity.  Illeity is found to not be reducible to the ontological tertiality of the third party, but to name the exceeding of subjectivity in terms of an absolute  susceptibility to the Other, and is an excessive concept of a singular universal: the human beyond being.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Levinas, Ethics, Justice, Humanity, Heidegger</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-Shelter Outcomes of Housing: A Case Study of the Relationships between Housing and Children&#65533;s Schooling</field><field name="creator">Young, Peter George</field><field name="description">The goal of this research is to provide a clearer understanding of the non-shelter impacts of housing, and in particular of the possible processes by which aspects of housing may impact on aspects of schooling.  The intention is not to prove a causal relationship, rather to shed light on mechanisms.  To that end the approach taken is qualitative, involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with a sample of public housing tenants and a smaller group of educators.    This thesis begins with an examination of previous research around this topic.  This review identifies past studies that highlight the possible negative effects of transience as a contributor to isolation; the role that neighbourhood may play in encouraging or discouraging the valuing of schooling; a possible link between crowding and punitive parenting practices; and the impact that high housing costs can have on stress levels and therefore health.    This thesis details research that builds on this earlier body of work.  Given findings from earlier studies (in particular the importance of neighbourhood effects identified in some United States&#65533; studies), a sampling framework was developed to ensure a reasonable number of households who had experienced a change in neighbourhood as well as housing conditions.  As well, an interview schedule was developed to provide a framework to ensure that possible pathways between housing and schooling identified in earlier research would be explored in these interviews.    Public tenants were chosen as the population group from which to draw the interview sample, as this group have undergone a significant housing change (when they moved into public housing), and their income levels increase the chances of them having lived in poor quality housing in the past.      A small number of interviews with educators were also conducted.  Schools were chosen randomly from outer suburbs where poor quality housing and transience were expected to impact on school populations.  As well an inner-city school in a gentrifying suburb was also selected for interview.    These interviews identified four main themes &#65533; transience, housing amenity, neighbourhood and cost.    Transience may be a significant problem for children who are already struggling in the school system, especially those who are receiving school based remediation.  For these children, moving house may interrupt important remediation work at school, and may result in children falling further and further behind their peers.  Also, transience may contribute to family stress levels which may impact on health and happiness, thereby reducing motivation and levels of school attendance.     Housing amenity can impact on health, as a result of injuries related to poorly maintained or designed housing, from stress associated with noise and broken sleep, and from insect born illnesses due to the absence of insect screens.  Possibly the most significant housing amenity related health impact seems to be due to the link between asthma, and dust and mildew.      Neighbourhood seems to have the potential to be a significant positive and negative force in people&#65533;s lives.  Supportive neighbours can make single parenting much less stressful, for example by helping with child-care, increasing the sense of safety, and reducing isolation.  Hostile neighbours, on the other hand, can create levels of stress that may force adults and children indoors to avoid conflict.      High housing costs can cause significant stress for families.  For those who are already suffering from stress this additional pressure may contribute to stress related ill-health.  As well, these families may not be able to afford to eat properly, and may not be able to afford to pay for extra-curricula activities such as school outings, dance classes etc.  Poor diet may contribute to increased incidents of illness, and extra days missed from school.

Since in modern states Medicine has generally been the occupational grouping which has most completely attained that status, it is seen as the model or archetype of professionalism.  This study focuses on just one aspect of medical autonomy, that relating to the right of medical professionals to be accountable only to their fellow professionals as far as the maintenance of practice standards are concerned. In this thesis, the theory underlying this system of "peer review" is examined and then its application during the course of the 20th century is traced in one particular jurisdiction, that of the State of New South Wales in Australia. The reason for the focus on NSW is that in this jurisdiction, medical autonomy existed and was exercised in a particularly pure and powerful form after it was instituted in 1900. However, it was also in NSW that for the first time anywhere in the world, an institutional challenge to medical disciplinary autonomy emerged with the establishment in 1984 of the "Complaints Unit" of the Department for Health. The thesis of this study is that as a result of this development, which within a comparatively short space of time led to the emergence of a system of "co-regulation" of medical discipline,  medical disciplinary autonomy and peer review had within a decade, been so severely challenged as to be almost extinct in this State.     In the light of theoretical frameworks provided by Weber, Habermas and the American scholar Robert Alford, the study examines the long drawn out struggle to institute medical autonomy in NSW in the 19th century, its entrenchment by subsequent legislation over the next eight decades and the "counter-attack" staged by the emergent forces of consumerism, supported by the forces of the ideology of "Public Interest Law" in the last two decades of the century. The study concludes with a discussion of the implications for definitions of professionalism which might result from the loss by Medicine in NSW, of  its right to exclusive control of medical discipline and the consequent disappearance of medical peer review.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical regulation;medical history;professionalism;health complaints;new south wales history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pachomius as Discovered in the Worlds of 4th Century Christian Egypt, Pachomian Literature and Pachomian Monasticism: A Figure of History or Hagiography?</field><field name="creator">Drayton, James Michael</field><field name="description">Pachomius as Discovered in the Worlds of 4th Century Christian Egypt, Pachomian Literature and Pachomian Monasticism: A Figure of History or Hagiography?</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pachomian monasticism;cenobitic monasticism;Throdane;hagiographic literature;gnostic thought;Hellenism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Offering of Wine: An Introductory exploration of the role of wine in the Hebrew Bible and ancient Judaism through the examination of the semantics of some keywords.</field><field name="creator">Jordan, David John</field><field name="description">The significance of wine to the residents of ancient Palestine is demonstrated by the large number of archaeological sites where a wine making installation has been identified and the role wine plays in the Hebrew Bible, the major work of literature to survive from ancient Palestine.  The role of wine in the Hebrew Bible has generated a large volume of material, although this has been partly driven by the ongoing temperance debate. Despite this there has been little or no thorough research as to which words and thus passages should be investigated to comprehensively examine wine in the Hebrew Bible. In addition those studies which do exist do not demonstrate any in-depth knowledge of wine production and its implications in translating and interpreting the Hebrew Bible. This work aims to address these two issues.  The origin of wine demonstrates that wine was known in Palestine during the Biblical period. Agriculture and Diet provide information as to the value and context of wine production. Semantic tools detail the linguistic information for examination of the ancient Hebrew words related to wine. The styles and production methods of wine and other alcoholic beverages in the ancient world set limits for the identification of beverages. All other information must be considered in the light of these four areas.  The core of this work is an examination of the key words related to wine: the likely members of the ancient Hebrew semantic field of wine the key words for grape, vine and vineyard and three words identified as installations used in wine production. It is only after such detailed examination that any in-depth study of wine in the Hebrew Bible should be considered.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hebrew Bible;wine;semantics;ancient Judaism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of digesta passage in rabbits and ringtail possums using markers and models</field><field name="creator">Herron, Fiona Michelle</field><field name="description">The common ringtail possum (Pseudocheirus peregrinus), a member of the family Pseudocheiridae, is an arboreal folivorous marsupial that feeds predominantly on Eucalyptus foliage. Contrary to the expectation that small body size would inhibit utilisation of a diet containing such high levels of lignified fibre because of relatively low gut volume to body mass ratios and relatively high mass-specific metabolic rates and nutrient requirements (Hume 1999), the ringtail possum is able to survive solely on a diet of Eucalyptus foliage.     The rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is a terrestrial herbivore and is a member of the family Leporidae that feeds predominantly on grasses. The rabbit was proposed as a digesta flow model for the ringtail possum since both are caecotrophic (periodically re-ingest caecal contents) and both are proposed to exhibit a colonic separation mechanism (CSM) where fluids and small, easily digested particles are preferentially returned to the caecum. The rabbit is of value for the modelling process since it is more accessible for experimental manipulation than the ringtail possum.    This study investigated a proposal to use digesta passage through the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of the rabbit as a model of digesta passage for the ringtail possum on the basis that both are caecotrophic caecum fermenters. A number of potential problems were identified with this proposal and investigation of these problems formed the basis for the research described in this thesis. Two main areas were identified as being potentially problematic: 1) fundamental flaws with the particulate markers used in digesta rate of passage studies; and 2) differences in animal behaviour and natural diet between the two subject species which suggested different digestive strategies and hence different patterns of digesta flow through the GIT.     The proposed digesta passage markers were lanthanide metals (Dy, Tm, Eu and Yb) attached to either fibrous particles (1200 - 600&#65533;m) or formalin-fixed rumen bacteria (20 &#65533; 0.2&#65533;m). These markers were shown to not be of the assumed size classes and the extent of lanthanide metal binding differed between the four metals used. An effect due to method of dosing was also observed. The findings of marker inconsistencies caused major limitation to model development and further research is necessary to clarify these markers.    The proposal to use digesta flow in the rabbit GIT as a model for digesta flow in the ringtail possum was shown to be idealistic due to the differences in anatomy and behaviour observed between the two herbivores. Laboratory observations, time series analysis and compartmental modelling confirmed the differences between the animals. This study showed: 1) the GIT of the rabbit was more complex both anatomically and functionally than that of the ringtail possum; 2) behaviour affecting digesta passage of the rabbit and ringtail were different and; 3) compartmental models confirmed the anatomical and behavioural findings. Digesta passage in the rabbit could not be modelled mathematically using data on digesta passage due to complexities of the system. In contrast, a basic model was constructed for digesta passage in the ringtail possum.    On the basis of these findings, the research hypothesis "that digesta passage in rabbits is similar to that in ringtail possums" was rejected.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rabbits;common ringtail possums;digesta passage;digesta markers;git modelling;lanthanide metals;Winsaam</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/483</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bliss Delight and Pleasure in Paradise Lost</field><field name="creator">Avin, Ittamar Johanan</field><field name="description">There have been many studies of keywords in Paradise Lost.  Over the last fifty or so years words such as &#65533;wander&#65533;, &#65533;lapse&#65533;, &#65533;error&#65533;, &#65533;fruit&#65533;, &#65533;balmy&#65533;, &#65533;fall&#65533;, &#65533;hands&#65533;, among others, have attracted critics&#65533; attention.  The present enquiry brings under scrutiny three linked keywords which have up to now escaped notice.  These are the words &#65533;bliss&#65533;, &#65533;delight&#65533;, and &#65533;pleasure&#65533;.  The fundamental proposition of the thesis is that Milton does not use these words haphazardly or interchangeably in his epic poem (though in other of his poetic productions he is by no means as fastidious).  On the contrary, he self-consciously distinguishes among the three terms, assigning to each its own particular &#65533;theatre of operations&#65533;.  Meant by this is that each keyword is selectively referred to a separate structural division of the epic, thus, &#65533;bliss&#65533; has reference specifically to Heaven (or to the earthly paradise viewed as a simulacrum of Heaven), &#65533;delight&#65533; to the earthly paradise in Eden and to the prelapsarian condition nourished by it; while &#65533;pleasure&#65533;, whose signification is ambiguous, refers in its favourable sense (which is but little removed from &#65533;delight&#65533;) to the Garden and the sensations associated with it, and in its unfavourable one to postlapsarian sensations and to the fallen characters.  Insofar as the three structural divisions taken into account (Hell is not) are hierarchically organized in the epic, so too are the three keywords that answer to them.  Moreover, in relating keywords to considerations of structure, the thesis breaks new ground in Paradise Lost studies.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bliss;delight;pleasure;paradise lost;John Milton</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/484</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolving Synoptic Maps of the solar magnetic field</field><field name="creator">McCloughan, John Leslie</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how magnetographic data may be used to study the longterm behaviour of the magnetic field distribution across the surface of the sun.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">synoptic maps;synoptic transport equation;solar magnetic field</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Regional Trade Agreements</field><field name="creator">Melatos, Mark</field><field name="description">In the last twenty years, regional trade agreements have proliferated.  These have  usually taken the form of  customs unions (CUs) or free trade areas (FTAs).  This thesis   concentrates mostly on the formation and behaviour of CUs.    Union members levy a common external tariff (CET) on non-members.  Existing theoretical models, however, do not agree on how the CET rate is chosen.  Every model imposes a different choice rule exogenously.  In this thesis, for   the first time, plausible choice rules, based on the CU's social welfare function, are  derived endogenously.  The strategic behaviour of members  and non-members, reveals that responsibility for CET choice tends to be assumed  by the member that can induce the rest of the world to levy those tariffs members prefer   to face.    Relatively few general results exist describing the relationship between country characteristics  and trade bloc formation.  Here, new light is shed on this issue, by systematically analysing bloc  formation in an asymmetric world, and investigating the role of preferences in  coalition formation.  It is found that global   free trade is most likely to arise when all countries are similar.  Customs unions tend to form   between relatively well-endowed countries or those with similar preferences.    It is also demonstrated that CUs will usually Pareto dominate FTAs, except   where preferences differ significantly.    The role of transfers in CU formation has received relatively little attention in the regionalism  literature.  In this thesis, optimal intra-union transfers are introduced and their   impact on CET choice is investigated.  The impact of transfers on CU behaviour  depends on the direction of the transfer.  When the relatively inelastic member is the  recipient, the CU responds less aggressively to non-member tariff choices than it does  when transfers are not permitted.  However, if the relatively elastic member is the  transfer recipient, the union's aggression increases.  Moreover, when one union member exercises a similar degree   of control over both CET and transfer choice, then the equilibrium CET tends to be   lower than in the corresponding no-transfers situation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">free trade areas;customs unions;common external tariff choice;free trade;core;transfers;regionalism;trade blocs</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/486</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of Artificial Neural Networks in Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="creator">Turner, Joseph Vernon</field><field name="description">Drug development is a long and expensive process. It is often not until potential drug candidates are administered to humans that accurate quantification of their pharmacokinetic characteristics is achieved. The goal of developing quantitative structure-pharmacokinetic relationships (QSPkRs) is to relate the molecular structure of a chemical entity with its pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this thesis artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to construct in silico predictive QSPkRs for various pharmacokinetic parameters using different drug data sets.  Drug pharmacokinetic data for all studies were taken from the literature. Information for model construction was extracted from drug molecular structure. Numerous theoretical descriptors were generated from drug structure ranging from simple constitutional and functional group counts to complex 3D quantum chemical numbers. Subsets of descriptors were selected which best modeled the target pharmacokinetic parameter(s).  Using manual selective pruning, QSPkRs for physiological clearances, volumes of distribution, and fraction bound to plasma proteins were developed for a series of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. All optimum ANN models had training and cross-validation correlations close to unity, while testing was performed with an independent set of compounds. In most cases the ANN models developed performed better than other published ANN models for the same drug data set.  The ability of ANNs to develop QSPkRs with multiple target outputs was investigated for a series of cephalosporins. Multilayer perceptron ANN models were constructed for prediction of half life, volume of distribution, clearances (whole body and renal), fraction excreted in the urine, and fraction bound to plasma proteins. The optimum model was well able to differentiate compounds in a qualitative manner while quantitative predictions were mostly in agreement with observed literature values. The ability to make simultaneous predictions of important pharmacokinetic properties of a compound made this a valuable model.  A radial-basis function ANN was employed to construct a quantitative structure-bioavailability relationship for a large, structurally diverse series of compounds. The optimum model contained descriptors encoding constitutional through to conformation dependent solubility characteristics. Prediction of bioavailability for the independent testing set were generally close to observed values. Furthermore, the optimum model provided a good qualitative tool for differentiating between drugs with either low or high experimental bioavailability.  QSPkR models constructed with ANNs were compared with multilinear regression models. ANN models were shown to be more effective at selecting a suitable subset of descriptors to model a given pharmacokinetic parameter. They also gave more accurate predictions than multilinear regression equations.  This thesis presents work which supports the use of ANNs in pharmacokinetic modeling. Successful QSPkRs were constructed using different combinations of theoretically-derived descriptors and model optimisation techniques. The results demonstrate that ANNs provide a valuable modeling tool that may be useful in drug discovery and development.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ANN;QSPkR;QSPR;theoretical descriptors;RBF;MLP;rho parameter;multiple output</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nurses' Perceptions of Clinical Decision Making in relation to Patients in Pain</field><field name="creator">Baker, Jacqueline Deborah</field><field name="description">Clinical decision-making (CDM) research has focused on diagnostic reasoning, CDM models, factors influencing CDM and the development of expertise.  The research approaches used, including phenomenology, have not addressed the question of how CDM is perceived and approached by nurses.  This study describes perceptions of CDM in relation to patients in pain using a phenomenographic methodology.    At semi-structured interviews, participants were asked to recall their responses to a situation involving a patient in pain.  The responses fell into four categories: (1) the effect of the clinical environment; (2) the role of other health professionals; (3) the place of the patient; and (4) the role of experience.  Examples of differences in perceptions that were likely to impact on the nurses&#65533; approach to CDM include: the ongoing effects of time and workload demands on CDM; nurses are initially dependent but were eventually able to make decisions autonomously; the patient who may be peripheral or central to CDM; and the nurses&#65533; move from the use of theoretical principles to experiential knowledge as reflection-on-practice is employed.  Perceptions in all categories are strongly implicated in the nurses&#65533; sense of confidence and independence.    Implications for nursing practice and nursing education suggested by the findings relate to the number of areas in which graduates work in the first year of practice, the size of new graduate workloads, graduate transition programs, the place of reflection-on-practice and undergraduate (UG) program clinical experience patterns.  Among issues for further research arising from the study are: replication of the study; detailed examination of the development of CDM in the first year of nursing practice and during UG nursing education programs; the role of other health professionals in the development of CDM behaviour; the links between CDM and clinical knowledge development; and the type of clinical environments that foster confidence and independence.  A conclusion of the study is that the way CDM is approached is influenced by the amount, quality, relevancy and recency of clinical experience.  In this study, phenomenography was shown to be an appropriate approach to the description of nurses&#65533; perceptions of CDM in relation to patients in pain.  In addition, nurses&#65533; changing perceptions over two years and the subsequent  effect on CDM behaviour were described.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">clinical decision making;reasoning;judgement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cork and talk: The cognitive and perceptual bases of wine expertise</field><field name="creator">Hughson, Angus Rannoch Leith</field><field name="description">A number of previous studies have found that wine experts can more accurately discriminate between and describe wine samples than novices. However, the mechanisms that underlie these disparities remain unclear. This collection of studies is an investigation of whether the expert advantage is based on long-term memory structures, such as found for other obviously more cognitive skills, such as chess and bridge expertise.   Experiments 1, 2 and 3 investigated whether wine experts are better than novices in recall of wine descriptions. It was hypothesised that experts would show more accurate recall than novices, although only when the descriptions were configured in a meaningful manner, that is, consistent with grape varieties commonly grown in Australia. The findings were as expected, with experts showing impaired recall for descriptions that did not match any grape variety (Experiment 2). In addition, expert recall was superior on an incidental task (Experiment 3), when recall was unexpected, suggesting that experts automatically refer to verbal long-term memory structures during a wine-related task.  These structures consist of wine-relevant terms, and are organised by their relationship to grape varieties, and more broadly, grape colour.  Experiments 4, 5, 6 and 7 investigated the role of the above-mentioned long-term memory structures in expert descriptive ability. The results supported their involvement, since expert&#65533;s ability to identify components was affected by sample configuration (Experiment 6) in a similar way to that found for recall of wine descriptions. Additional evidence comes from the finding that, novices, when provided with a small set of grape-relevant labels during a descriptive task, performed better than subjects given either no list or a long list of labels relevant to all the different grape varieties (Experiment 4). While experts correctly identified more flavours than novices, they also made more errors (Experiment 6), suggesting that verbal long-term memory structures do not increase the accuracy of the identification of aromas and flavours by experts. Rather, they inform experts as to which labels are likely to be correct for particular styles of wine.  Experiments 8, 9 and 10 investigated both the discrimination performance of novices, intermediates and experts, as well as the role of long-term memory structures in any expert discriminative advantage. Experts (Experiments 8 and 10) and intermediates (Experiment 9) showed greater powers of discrimination than novices. However, results were equivocal in relation to the role of verbal long-term memory structures (Experiment 10), suggesting that other factors, such as perceptual learning and or memory, may be important in the expert discriminative advantage. Overall, results from these studies illustrate that long-term memory structures are essential, not only in domains of expertise that are obviously based on cognitive skills, but also that of descriptive ability with respect to wine. However, unlike in other domains, these structures do not serve to improve the relative accuracy of descriptive performance, at least with regard to aromas and flavours.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wine;expertise;knowledge;cognition;perception</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/490</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of techniques for measuring the water content of soil and other porous media</field><field name="creator">George, Brendan Hugh</field><field name="description">The measurement of water in soil on a potential, gravimetric or volumetric basis is considered, with studies concentrating on the measurement of water by dielectric and neutron moderation methods.  The ability of the time-domain reflectometry technique to measure water content simultaneously at different spatial locations is an important advantage of the technique.  The reported apparent dielectric by the TRASE&#65533; time-domain reflectometer and Pyelab time-domain reflectometry systems is sensitive to change in extension cable length.  In some soil, e.g. a commercial sand, the response to increasing extension length of extension cable is linear.  For other soil a linear response occurs for certain lengths of cable at different moisture contents.  A single model accounting for clay content, extension cable length, time-domain reflectometry system, probe type and inherent moisture conditions explained 62.2 % of variation from the control (0 m extension) cable.  The extension cable causes a decrease in the returning electromagnetic-wave energy; leading to a decline in the slope used in automatic end-point determination.  Calibration for each probe installation when the soil is saturated, and at small water contents is recommended.     The ability of time-domain reflectometry, frequency-domain and neutron moderation techniques in measuring soil water content in a Brown Chromosol is examined.  An in situ calibration, across a limited range of water contents, for the neutron moderation method is more sensitive to changing soil water content than the factory supplied 'universal' calibration.  Comparison of the EnviroSCAN&#65533; frequency-domain system and the NMM count ratio indicates the frequency-domain technique is more sensitive to change in soil water conditions. The EnviroSCAN&#65533; system is well suited to continuous profile-based measurement of soil water content. Results with the time-domain reflectometry technique were disappointing, indicating the limited applicability of time-domain reflectometry in profile based soil water content measurement in heavy-textured soil, or soil with a large electrical conductivity.  The method of auguring to a known depth and placement of the time-domain reflectometry probe into undisturbed soil is not recommended.     A time-domain reflectometry system is adapted for in situ measurement of water in an iron ore stockpile.  The laboratory calibration for water content of the processed iron ore compares favourably to a field calibration.  In the field study, the 28 m extension cable used to connect the probes to the time-domain reflectometry affected the end-point determination of the time-domain reflectometry system.  To account for this, 0.197 should be subtracted from the reported apparent dielectric before calculation of volumetric moisture content.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil water;hydraulic properties;water balance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermo-Mechanical Behaviour of Two Reconstituted Clays</field><field name="creator">Ghahremannejad, Behrooz</field><field name="description">The effect of temperature on soil behaviour has been the subject of many studies in recent years due to an increasing number of projects related to the application of high temperature to soil. One example is the construction of facilities for the disposal of hot high level nuclear waste canisters (150-200C) several hundred meters underground in the clay formations. Despite this, the effects and mechanism by which temperature affects the soil properties and behaviour are not fully known. A limited amount of reliable experimental data, technological difficulties and experimental methods employed by different researchers could have contributed to the uncertainties surrounding the soil behaviour at elevated temperature. Also several thermo-mechanical models have been developed for soil behaviour, but their validity needs to be examined by reliable experimental data.  In this research, efforts have been made to improve the experimental techniques. Direct displacement measuring devices have been successfully used for the first time to measure axial and lateral displacements of clay samples during tests at various temperatures. The thermo mechanical behaviour of two reconstituted clays has been investigated by performing triaxial and permeability tests at elevated temperature. Undrained and drained triaxial tests were carried out on normally consolidated and over consolidated samples of M44 clay and Kaolin C1C under different effective stresses, and at temperatures between 22C and 100C. Permeability tests were carried out on samples of M44 clay at temperatures between 22C and 50C. The effects of temperature on permeability, volume change, pore pressure development, shear strength and stiffness, stress strain response and critical state parameters for different consolidation histories have been investigated by comparing the results at various temperatures. The results are also compared with the predictions of two models.  It has been found that at elevated temperature the shear strength, friction angle and initial small strain stiffness reduce whereas permeability increases. The slope of the swelling line in the v-p&#65533; plane has been found to reduce with temperature. The slope of the isotropic normal consolidation line (INCL) and critical state line (CSL) in the v-p&#65533; plane have been observed to be independent of temperature, but both the INCL and the CSL shift downwards to lower locations as temperature increases. The deformations during drained cooling and re heating cycles have been found to be elastic and to simply reflect the expansivity of the soils solid particles. The thermal volume changes during undrained heating have been observed to be direct results of the thermal expansion of water and clay particles. The internal displacement measuring devices have been found to produce reliable data for the variation of strains at elevated temperature.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">temperature;heating;clay;mechanical;triaxial;Cam Clay;permeability;strength;critical state;nuclear disposal;consolidation;model</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Results of Federalism: an examination of housing and disability services</field><field name="creator">Monro, Dugald John</field><field name="description">Housing and disability services</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">federalism;intergovernmental relations;housing policy;disability services</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The social construction of illiteracy: a study of the construction of illiteracy within schooling and methods to overcome it.</field><field name="creator">Williamson, Peter Burnett</field><field name="description">Pre-literate children experience written text as a meaningless material object, the word-object, but the compulsory and institutional aspects of reading pedagogy make this an experience from which they cannot escape. Some children begin to associate their own negative experiental sense with the word-object before they are able to learn to read.       As reading pedagogy continues, these children begin to read back experiental sense which prevents them from converting the word-object to meaningful text. Experiental sense is repressed because it is psychically painful. It retains qualities of phenomena repressed from childhood: it is active and intractable to reason.       The result is an intractable illiteracy which may be interpreted as biologically based &#65533;dyslexia.&#65533; Further attempts at reading pedagogy in childhood and adulthood generally result in reproduction of the inability because this pedagogy requires learners to attempt to read linguistically which elicits experiental sense. As these children become adults, their avoidance of reading sometimes structures their social relations to accommodate and compound their problems.         The method to overcome the problem replaces experiental sense with positive feelings about written language. The power of language to denote emotions of pleasure and affirmation from learners&#65533; lives is used. These emotions are enhanced through a technique of affirmative intersubjectivity. Short spoken affirmative texts are made by learners, tape recorded and reproduced as written texts by the literacy worker. Through allowing learners control and autonomy over their spoken and written texts, the positive emotions in them are associated by learners with the written  texts.        Exercises on the affirmative written texts are used to demonstrate regularities about written language. Learners then progress to reading suitable independent texts and other activities. There are suggestions about how to enhance learners&#65533; feelings as competent readers and writers.        The thesis uses a methodology of action research and includes five case studies of adults with literacy problems. Concepts from social theory, psychoanalysis and object relations theory are used and adapted to understand written language, schooling and illiteracy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">illiteracy;dyslexia;schooling;social theory;psychoanalysis;object relations theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deccan Queen: A Spatial Analysis of Poona in the Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries</field><field name="creator">Mullen, Wayne Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis is structured around the analysis of a model that describes the Cantonment, the Civil Lines, the Sadr Bazar and part of the Native City of the Western Indian settlement of Poona in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">India;British Raj;Historical Archaeology;geographical information systems;GIS;Military Cantonment;Pune</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thermomechanical and Transformational Behaviour and Applications of Shape Memory Alloys and their Composites</field><field name="creator">Tsoi, Kelly Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis details an investigation into the properties and applications of shape memory alloy (SMA) composites.

As an initial step, the transformation behaviour of constrained SMAs was investigated in order to obtain a better understanding into the recovery stress generation of these wires when embedded into a composite material. It is known that the transformation is based on two types of martensite within the alloy; self accommodating and preferentially oriented martensite. The amounts of each type and how they vary with differing pre-strain were determined through DSC measurements and an explanation for why preferentially oriented martensite is not observed during DSC testing was made.    The next step was to investigate the effectiveness of embedding SMA wires into composites and the thermomechanical properties of the SMA wires and the SMA-composites were determined. This was completed using a specially designed tensile testing machine which was capable of having the whole specimen immersed into an oil bath and heated and cooled repeatedly. The stress-strain, strain-temperature, stress-temperature, resistance-strain and cyclic properties of various wires were obtained, giving a better understanding of the behaviour of SMA wires under different test conditions. NiTiCu SMA wires were embedded into kevlar composite materials and the recovery stress generation (stress-temperature), stress-strain, and strain-temperature behaviour was determined.    If SMA-composites are to be used as new materials for structural applications, verification that the embedment of pre-strained SMA wires into the material doesn't adversely affect the impact behaviour needs to be carried out. SMA-composite specimens with varying volume fractions of superelastic SMA wires, pre-strain and position through the thickness were made up for impact damage characterisation. These specimens were impacted at three different energy levels. The results showed that by embedding SMA wires into composite materials there is a reasonably low damage accumulation after impact. There is also no adverse impact effect on the structure compared with structures without wires as well as structures with other types of wires such as steel and martensitic SMA wires. The SMA-composites showed good damping and energy absorption capabilities.    A novel application of SMA-composites is their use as a SMA patch in order to repair damage in existing cracked metallic structures. An analytical study and finite element modelling showing the closure stresses obtainable for use as patches was made.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shape memory alloys;SMA;composites;thermomechanical behaviour;impact damage</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/496</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation Salience: A Model of Equivalence in Translation (Arabic/English)</field><field name="creator">Trotter, William</field><field name="description">The term equivalence describes the relationship between a translation and the text from which it is translated.  Translation is generally viewed as indeterminate insofar as there is no single acceptable translation - but many.  Despite this, the rationalist metaphor of translation equivalence prevails. Rationalist approaches view translation as a process in which an original text is analysed to a level of abstraction, then transferred into a second representation from which a translation is generated.  At the deepest level of abstraction, representations for analysis and generation are identical and transfer becomes redundant, while at the surface level it is said that surface textual features are transferred directly.  Such approaches do not provide a principled explanation of how or why abstraction takes place in translation.  They also fail to resolve the dilemma of specifying the depth of transfer appropriate for a given translation task. By focusing on the translator&#65533;s role as mediator of communication, equivalence can be understood as the coordination of information about situations and states of mind. A fundamental opposition is posited between the transfer of rule-like or codifiable aspects of equivalence and those non-codifiable aspects in which salient information is coordinated. The Translation Salience model proposes that Transfer and Salience constitute bipolar extremes of a continuum. The model offers a principled account of the translator&#65533;s interlingual attunement to multi-placed coordination, proposing that salient information can be accounted for with three primary notions: markedness, implicitness and localness. Chapter Two develops the Translation Salience model.     The model is supported with empirical evidence from published translations of Arabic and English texts. Salience is illustrated in Chapter Three through contextualized interpretations associated with various Arabic communication resources (repetition, code switching, agreement, address in relative clauses, and the disambiguation of presentative structures). Measurability of the model is addressed in Chapter Four with reference to emerging computational techniques. Further research is suggested in connection with theme and focus, text type, cohesion and collocation relations.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">translation;equivalence;salience;Arabic;English;indeterminacy;meaning;interpretation;computation;natural language processing;contrastive analysis;transfer;coordination;markedness;implicitness;localness;repetition;code switching</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rethinking the dynamics of capital accumulation in colonial and post-colonial Indonesia: Production Regulation</field><field name="creator">Mack, Andrew Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the forces driving a series of momentous transformations to Indonesia&#65533;s production and distribution systems since early colonial rule. The analysis of these forces is anchored in four conceptual themes: the basis of these systemic transformations, their politico-economic ordering as driven by a surplus-creation imperative, labour&#65533;s role in this imperative and its response to the &#65533;ordering&#65533;, and the mode of production as the historical setting within which the transformations occur.  This thesis illuminates an analytical gap in the literature by nominating labour as the key force in wealth-creation and recognising its active role in challenging ruling appropriation regimes and in the broader social struggles against exploitation and oppression.      The thematic focus defines the boundaries for an exploration of successive colonial and post-colonial ruling regimes.  Early chapters examine how the Dutch penetrated the Indonesian politico-economy, entrenching their systems of production organisation and creating an exclusionary system of wealth appropriation. Appropriation systems are characterised by transitions in European political and economic systems, especially from mercantilism to industrial capitalism. The entrenchment of colonial power is considered in relation to the expansion of capitalist organisation in Indonesia.  The state&#65533;s stimulation of this expansion is associated with an undermining of the country&#65533;s reproductive base and a growing challenge to foreign rule.  The Japanese occupying force&#65533; demolition of colonial productive and distributive linkages and encouragement of independence activism is connected with a post-war struggle for independence. Links are drawn between colonial rule and the tensions and organisational difficulties faced by Republican regimes leading up to the New Order&#65533;s re-establishment of a strict regulatory regime, and the development of an indigenous system of capitalist organisation. The surplus-generation and appropriation perspective informs the evolution of Indonesia&#65533;s productive and economic systems across colonial and post-colonial epochs and the challenges to the system of social and production regulation that heralded the destabilisation of New Order rule and the rise of the contemporary era of political democracy.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">labour regulation;colonial wealth extraction;class analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THREE DIMENSIONAL LIQUEFACTION ANALYSIS OF OFFSHORE FOUNDATIONS</field><field name="creator">Taiebat, Hossein Ali</field><field name="description">This thesis presents numerical techniques which have been developed to analyse three dimensional problems in offshore engineering. In particular, the three dimensional liquefaction analysis of offshore foundations on granular soils is the main subject of the thesis.     The subject matter is broadly divided into four sections:    1)Development of an efficient method for the three dimensional elasto?plastic finite element analysis of consolidating soil through the use of a discrete Fourier representation of field quantities.    2)Validation of the three dimensional method through analyses of shallow offshore foundations subjected to three dimensional loading and investigation of the yield locus for foundations on purely cohesive soils.    3)Formulation of governing equations suitable for three dimensional liquefaction analyses of offshore foundations founded on granular soil, presentation of a method for liquefaction analyses, and application of the method in modified elastic liquefaction analyses of offshore foundations.    4)Application of a conventional elasto?plastic soil model in the liquefaction analyses of offshore foundations using the three dimensional finite element method.    The finite element method developed in this thesis provides a rigorous and efficient numerical tool for the analysis of geotechnical problems subjected to three dimensional loading. The efficiency of the numerical tool makes it possible to tackle some of the problems in geotechnical engineering which would otherwise need enormous computing time and thus would be impractical. The accuracy of the numerical scheme is demonstrated by solving the bearing capacity problem of shallow foundations subjected to three dimensional loading. The generalized governing equations and the numerical method for liquefaction analyses presented in this thesis provide a solid base for the analysis of offshore foundations subjected to cyclic wave loading where they are founded on potentially liquefiable soil. The practicability of the numerical scheme is also demonstrated by a modified elastic liquefaction analysis of offshore foundations. The liquefaction phenomenon is redefined in the context of the conventional Mohr?Coulomb model, so that a relatively simple and practical model for elasto?plastic liquefaction analysis is presented.     The three dimensional finite element method together with the numerical scheme for liquefaction analysis and the elasto?plastic soil model provide a suitable practical engineering tool for exploring the responses of offshore foundations subjected to cyclic wave loading.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">3D finite element;Offshore foundations;Liquefaction;Bearing capacity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/499</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Maternal Abject</field><field name="creator">Astore, Mireille</field><field name="description">Abstract      In this Research paper and through my Studio practice, I search for what binds me and separates me from my children.  I investigate abjection theories through Julia Kristeva and Georges Bataille and focus on a particular form I call the maternal abject. This occurs at the time an infant separates from its mother, acquires language and maps its own body. I am proposing that the mapping of the body is the point at which an individual perceives social structures and learns about prohibitions and taboos, hence the abject. I also investigate the relationship between the maternal abject and the artistic process through the writings of Kristeva. Abjection is illustrated through the works of Mona Hatoum, Fiona Hall, Hieronymus Bosch, and Paul Quinn. The maternal abject is illustrated through the works of Mary Kelly, Cindy Sherman, Frida Kahlo, Louise Bourgeois. A possible reading of the maternal abject is given through the works of Gregory Crewdson, Joel-Peter Witkin and Francis Bacon.    The studio work is in two parts. The first part is a series of layered photomedia images. The layers consist of a naked female body, which has been merged with Renaissance like Madonna and Child images. Texture, such as stones and spikes, is embedded to signify the fragility and strength of the body. Children are also present and are merged with the adult female body. All images are cradled in a darkened atmosphere in order to draw the viewer inside the images. The second part is a bassinet, which has been drilled and pierced by thousands of pearl-headed steel pins. This piece signifies the dichotomy of the motherhood experience, which on the one hand is rewarding and fulfilling and on the other an abject and isolating experience of no apparent economic value.  The two parts interact so that the bassinet piece with its threatening exterior acts as an aggressor towards the photomedia images.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">motherhood;abjection;personal;photography;photomedia;digital photography;Madonna and child;women;art;Julia Kristeva;Mon Hatoum;Fiona Hall;Cindy Sherman;Gregory Crewdson;Mary Kelly;Frida Kahlo</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE  P2X7  RECEPTOR  OF  HUMAN  LEUKOCYTES</field><field name="creator">Gu, Baijun</field><field name="description">Lymphocytes from normal subjects and patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) show functional responses to extracellular ATP characteristic of the P2X7 receptor.  These responses include opening of a cation selective channel/pore which allows entry of the fluorescent dye, ethidium+ and activation of a membrane metalloprotease which sheds the adhesion molecule L-selectin.  In this thesis, the surface expression of P2X7 receptors was measured in normal leucocytes, platelets and B-CLL lymphocytes and compared with their functional responses.   Monocytes showed 4-5 fold greater expression of P2X7 than B-, T- and NK- lymphocytes, while P2X7 expression on neutrophils and platelets was weak.  All cell types demonstrated abundant intracellular expression of this receptor. All 12 subjects with B-CLL expressed surface P2X7 at about the same level as for B-lymphocytes from normal subjects.  P2X7 function, measured by ATP-induced uptake of ethidium, correlated closely with surface expression of this receptor in normal and B-CLL lymphocytes and monocytes. However, the ATP-induced uptake of ethidium into the malignant B-lymphocytes in 3 patients was low or absent.  The lack of P2X7 function in these B-lymphocytes was confirmed by the failure of ATP to induce Ba2+ uptake into their lymphocytes. This lack of function of the P2X7 receptor resulted in a failure of ATP-induced shedding of L-selectin, an adhesion molecule which directs the recirculation of lymphocytes from blood into the lymph node.   To study a possible genetic basis of non-functional P2X7 receptor, we sequenced DNA coding for the carboxyl terminal tail of P2X7.  In 33 of 130 normal subjects a heterozygous nucleotide substitution (1513A--C) was found while 3 subject carried the homozygous substitution which codes for glutamic acid to alanine at amino acid position 496.  Surface expression of P2X7 on lymphocytes was not affected by this 496Glu--Ala polymorphism demonstrated both by confocal microscopy and immunofluorescent staining.  Monocytes and lymphocytes from the 496Glu--Ala homozygote subject expressed non-functional receptor while heterozygotes showed P2X7 function which was half that of wild type P2X7.  Results of transfection experiments showed the mutant P2X7 receptor was non-functional when expressed at low receptor density but regained function at a high receptor density.  This density-dependence of mutant P2X7 function was also seen on differentiation of fresh monocytes to macrophages with interferon-gamma which upregulated mutant P2X7 and partially restored its function. P2X7-mediated apoptosis of lymphocytes was impaired in homozygous mutant P2X7 compared with wild type. The data suggest that the glutamic acid at position 496 is required for optimal assembly of the P2X7 receptor.  Apart from the 496Glu--Ala polymorphism, three other single nucleotide polymorphisms, 155His--Tyr, 348Ala--Thr and 568Ile--Asn were also found in the P2X7 receptor. The site directed mutant cDNA were generated for all 3 polymorphisms and transfected into HEK293 cells to study the impact of these polymorphisms on P2X7 function. Results suggested that Ile568 is important for P2X7 protein trafficking to cell surface.  Further study of these two loss-of-function polymorphisms (496Glu--Ala and 568Ile--Asn) may help better understanding of the functional domains in the P2X7 receptor and its role in CLL, lymphoma and infectious diseases.    Conclusions:  1.P2X7 receptor is expressed in human leukocytes, including lymphocytes, natural killer cells as well as monocytes, on both surface and intracellular locations.  2.Both the expression and function of P2X7 are highly variable between in human individuals.  Non-functional P2X7 receptors are found in some subjects, including both normal subjects and CLL patients, and are often associated with defects in ATP-induced cytotoxicity and L-selectin shedding.  3.Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 496Glu--Ala and 568Ile--Asn, are found at low frequency in the human population and lead to the loss-of-function of P2X7.  Both permeabllity function and the downstream effects mediated by P2X7 are affected by these two SNPs.  The mechanisms for the loss-of-function differs between the two polymorphisms.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">P2X7 receptor;single nucleotide polymorphism;chronic lymphocytic leukemia;ATP-induced ethidium uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/501</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responses of accessions of Austrodanthonia spp. to factors associated with soil acidity</field><field name="creator">Islam, Mohammed Anowarul</field><field name="description">Pasture plants already adapted to acidic soil conditions are required as part of an integrated approach (with lime amelioration) to managing acid soils on the Tablelands of New South Wales, Australia. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the usefulness of Austrodanthonia species for this purpose. The material evaluated in this study was collected during a previous survey of the distribution of Austrodanthonia on the Central, Southern and Monaro Tablelands of New South Wales. It was hypothesised that the genus Austrodanthonia has a wide range of tolerance to acid soils.  A series of experiments that provided information on the growth and physiology of Austrodanthonia in relation to soil acidity, with a view to the identification and eventual domestication of the most promising plant material have been conducted through pot, hydroponics and field investigations.  Firstly, soils were acidified or limed to obtain a range of soil pH and Al concentrations. This experiment showed that adding aluminium sulfate and calcium carbonate followed by washing excess salts with water is a simple, rapid and convenient method for adjusting soil pH for pot experiments. The pH of the amended soils remained relatively unchanged eight months after treatment. The experimental set-up also resulted in a wide range of soluble Al (2-52 mg/kg) across the soils.  The relative Al-tolerance of 183 accessions from 15 Austrodanthonia species was tested in a pot experiment using a range of soil pH. Emergence, survival and growth of all accessions were drastically reduced by high soil acidity (pH 3.9, P &lt; 0.001). About 11% of plants emerged at pH 3.9, whereas at pH 4.4 and 5.3, ~72% of plants emerged. Accessions exhibited large variation within and between species in their tolerance to soil acidity. From the species/accessions tested, 49 accessions from eight species were selected for further study (on the basis of being more acid tolerant).  Hydroponic experiments conducted in the glasshouse evaluated: (i) formulation of nutrient solution with a stable pH, (ii) effectiveness of the formulation using tap water and deionised water and (iii) estimation of free ion activities of Al and Mn in the nutrient solution and their effects on Austrodanthonia growth. These experiments showed that a NO3-N/NH4-N ratio of 9:4 is the most appropriate ratio to obtain a stable pH 4.0 without affecting plant growth; that there was little difference between tap water and deionised water on the ionic effects of Al and Mn, and plant-size did not play a role on accession survival and that accessions of Austrodanthonia could grow well within a wide range of pH (3.5-5.5), Al (50-250 &#65533;M) and Mn (100-2000 &#65533;M). Growth of Austrodanthonia accessions declined under high acidity (pH &lt; 3.5) and Al (300 &#65533;M), but tolerated high concentrations of Mn (2000 &#65533;M).  Root-tips stained with hematoxylin grouped accessions in a similar way to the pot and hydroponic experiments for most of the accessions tested. The intensity of root staining with hematoxylin and the differential distribution of Al in the shoots and roots provided an indication that different tolerance mechanisms may be involved with Austrodanthonia accessions. It appears that both exclusion and internal mechanisms may operate for Al- and Mn-tolerance.  A field experiment was conducted at Carcoar (33037&#65533;S, 149013&#65533;E, elevation 800 m) using gradients in soil pH and Al available on-site to grow selected accessions of Austrodanthonia. The accessions exhibited a range of responses to soil acidity. The accession responses to acidity from the pot and hydroponic experiments were similar to those obtained in the field, especially where Al was present as a low Al-challenge.  Overall, this study shows that Austrodanthonia exhibits a wide range of acid tolerance between species and accessions within species. Among the species tested, A. duttoniana and A. fulva appeared to have the greatest commercial potential, because of their productivity and acid tolerance. The variability that exists in the accessions may be exploitable in breeding and selection programs for improved cultivars.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accession;acidity;Ai toxicity;Austrodanthonia;emergence;growth;H+ toxicity;hematoxylin;hydroponics;Mn toxicity;native grass;pasture;physiology;soil pH</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of fimbrial antigens of Dichelobacter nodosus in diagnosis and pathogenesis of footrot</field><field name="creator">Dhungyel, Om Prakash</field><field name="description">Studies presented in this thesis looked at developing new methods for the diagnosis of virulent footrot (VFR) in sheep and identification of serogroups of Dichelobacter nodosus, the principal causative agent of footrot.     Earlier studies had shown that immunological memory response in sheep recovered from VFR can be aroused by natural or recurrent infection or by injection of outer membrane protein (OMP) antigens to be used as a retrospective diagnostic test for VFR. But OMP antigen was found to be non-specific in older animals. To overcome this non-specificity of OMP antigen in anamnestic response, pilus antigen was evaluated in a trial at Camden.     The results of this trial indicated that antibodies to pilus antigen can be detected over time in a manner similar to OMP antibodies so a retrospective assessment of VFR status can be made by anamnestic test with pilus antigens. The anamnestic response to pilus was similar in character to OMP antigen but unlike OMP was highly specific. The response to anamnestic challenge with pilus was determined by severity of the lesions they had expressed, with severe lesions triggering the greater responses. However, there was variation between individuals, with some (6 of 46 with severe lesions) failing to respond. This individual variation is probably mediated genetically as is response to vaccination.    This anamnestic test was tested in flocks of sheep in Nepal that had a history of VFR which had apparently been eradicated. That assessment, based on clinical findings, was confirmed by the uniformly negative results  in the pilus anamnestic test applied to a representative sample of the population. This allowed a conclusion that the virulent strains of D. nodosus involved had been eliminated from these flocks.      As mentioned in the preceding study pilus antigen was found to be very specific and ideal for retrospective diagnosis of virulent footrot with an anamnestic challenge ELISA test. However, serogroup specificity was seen as a disadvantage of using pilus antigen for the anamnestic test. The possibility of using multivalent pilus antigens was tested in another trial. These animals had been involved in a clinical expression experiment conducted by another research group and had a clinical and bacteriological history extending over  more than 12 months. After these initial trials all these animals were treated for footrot and managed for 5 months as a single flock at Camden. These were then challenged with multivalent pilus antigen (serogroup A - I) as a single injection.     The results obtained indicate that multivalent pilus anamnestic ELISA is equally effective as monovalent pilus. This has the added advantage that prior knowledge of the serogroups present in the flock is not required. It has the possibility of being used as an indirect test to check the presence of serogroups in a flock without doing the bacterial cultures. This test can identify most animals with pre-existing underrunning lesions (Scores of 3 or higher). However, the sensitivity and specificity of this test need to be tested extensively in flocks of known clinical history before it could be adopted as a routine test.     As a key component of a larger study to determine the role of fimbrial genes (fimA and fimB) of D. nodosus in the pathogenesis of footrot using allelic exchange to disrupt these genes of a strain (serogroup G), the study presented in this thesis contributed a detailed characterisation of the resultant mutant and the wild strains and tested these strains for virulence in sheep.  The results presented provided the first definitive evidence that the fimA gene is essential for virulence of D.nodosus in sheep. In vivo virulence testing of two fimA mutants showed that they were not able to establish any footrot whereas the wild type of the same strain produced virulent footrot in the same trial conducted under similar conditions. These mutant bacteria were not re-isolated from interdigital skin after in vivo challenge. This indicated that fimA mutant strains could not colonise the ovine foot, and the simplest and most likely explanation for these results was that colonisation of the interdigital skin and subsequent penetration of the stratum corneum requires the adhesive activity of type IV fimbriae. However, since these mutants also had altered ability to secrete extracellular proteases, and perhaps other as yet unknown extracellular proteins, the possibility of the involvement of these factors as major determinants of host colonisation or invasion cannot be excluded.       Current methods for the identification of the serogroup of D. nodosus present in the bacterial population requires isolation of the organism and after purification by subculture, antigenic analysis with agglutination tests. This usually takes at least 3 to 4 weeks. With the objective of developing a rapid serogroup specific PCR assay, the basis of serogroup variation in D. nodosus localised in the fimbrial gene region was exploited. A common forward primer and 9 serogroup specific reverse primers were selected from the fimbrial gene sequences of the prototype strains. Analytical sensitivity of the serogroup specific primers on chromosomal DNA was similar to PCR tests in other bacterial species reported before. Immuno-magnetic bead capture PCR method was able to detect 5 to 10 cells in cell lysates. Specificity within and between the serogroups of D. nodosus was tested with all the prototype strains. They were found to be very specific to each serogroup and specific only to D. nodosus when tested with 84 commonly found bacterial strains or strains related to D. nodosus.     To overcome the time delay in conducting 9 different amplifications to find out the prevalence of all possible serogroups in a flock multiplex PCR reactions with common forward primer and groups of 3, 4 and 5 reverse primers were successful in reducing the number of reactions to 2 (with groups of 4 and 5) or 3 (with groups of 3) primers. A drawback of the multiplex reaction was that if a template was 1000 times less concentrated that the others in the mixture it was not amplified but the margin for difference is very high.    The main aim of developing rapid serogroup specific PCR was to apply these tests directly on footrot lesion samples to make it a rapid diagnostic test for field samples. The sensitivity of the test on lesion samples was found to be very low. To try and improve the sensitivity an overnight or four days old pre-enrichment culture in broth was tested but was found to be no better than direct PCR. The immuno-magnetic capture method which improved the sensitivity of pure culture samples by 10 -100 fold also had very low sensitivity with lesion samples.            However, this drawback can be overcome by picking up colonies from 4 days old lesion cultures on hoof agar (HA) plates for serogroup specific  multiplex PCR. If the colonies are too small/ too few on the lesion cultures these can be sub cultured onto  a quarter of 4 percent HA plates and then used for the PCR test which also reduces the time taken for serogrouping at least by 2 weeks. The other advantage is that individual colonies do not need to be isolated. A PCR test can be done on pooled colonies just as well and can be used to identify all serogroups present in the sample.     Serogroup specific PCR is much faster and is more sensitive and accurate than slide agglutination tests which take 3 to 4 weeks to complete. Multiplex PCR makes it easier to detect different serogroups in a sample with a maximum of 3 PCR tests. Serogroup specific multiplex PCR will be a useful tool for footrot control based on specific vaccination. The difficulty in using the test on direct lesion swabs needs to be further looked into. There may be future advances in the application of PCR tests to clinical samples.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">footrot;Dichelobacter nodosus;fimbrial antegens;diagnosis;pathogenesis;sheep</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solution Behaviour of Polyethylene Oxide, Nonionic Gemini Surfactants</field><field name="creator">FitzGerald, Paul Anthony</field><field name="description">In recent years there has been increasing interest in novel forms of surfactants.  Of particular interest are gemini surfactants, which consist of two conventional surfactants joined by a spacer at the head groups, as they exhibit lower critical micelle concentrations than can be achieved by conventional surfactants.  In this work, the self-assembly behaviour of several nonionic gemini surfactants with polyethylene oxide head groups (GemnEm, where n (= 20) is the number of carbons per tail and m (= 10, 15, 20 and 30) is the number of ethylene oxides per head group) were investigated.  The Critical Micelle Concentrations (CMCs) were measured using a fluorescence probe technique.  The CMCs are all ~2 x 10?7 M, with almost no variation with m.  The CMCs are several orders of magnitude lower than conventional C12Em nonionic surfactants.  The mixing behaviour of the gemini surfactants with conventional surfactants was also studied.  They obeyed ideal mixing behaviour with both ionic and nonionic surfactants.  Micelle morphologies were studied using Small Angle Neutron Scattering.  The gemini surfactants with the larger head groups (i.e. Gem20E20 and Gem20E30) formed spherical micelles.  Gem20E15 showed strong scattering at low Q, characteristic of elongated micelles.  As the temperature was increased towards the cloud point, the scattering approached the Q-1 dependence predicted for infinite, straight rods.  The existence of anisotropic micelles was supported by the viscosity of Gem20E15, which increases by several orders of magnitude on heating towards its cloud point.  Phase behaviour was determined using Diffusive Interfacial Transport coupled to near-infrared spectroscopy.  Much of the behaviour of these systems is similar to conventional nonionic surfactants.  For example, Gem20E10 forms a dilute liquid isotropic phase (W) coexisting with a concentrated lamellar phase (La) at around room temperature and forms a sponge phase at higher temperatures.  This is similar to the behaviour of C12E3 and C12E4.  The other surfactants studied are all quite soluble in water and form liquid isotropic and hexagonal phases from room temperature.  At higher concentrations Gem20E15 formed a cubic and then a lamellar phase while Gem20E20 formed a cubic phase and then an intermediate phase.  This is also comparable to the phase behaviour of conventional nonionic surfactants except the intermediate phase, which is often only observed for surfactant systems with long alkyl tails.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non ionic gemini surfactants;SANS;CMC;Phase Behaviour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Early Archaean crustal evolution: evidence from ~3.5million year old greenstone successions in the Pilgangoora Belt, Pilbara Craton, Australia</field><field name="creator">Green, Michael Godfrey</field><field name="description">In the Pilgangoora Belt of the Pilbara Craton, Australia, the 3517 Ma Coonterunah Group and 3484-3468 Ma Carlindi granitoids underlie the 3458 Ma Warrawoona Group beneath an erosional unconformity, thus providing evidence for ancient emergent continental crust. The basalts either side of the unconformity are remarkably similar, with N-MORB-normalised enrichment factors for LILE, Th, U and LREE greater than those for Ta, Nb, P, Zr, Ti, Y and M-HREE, and initial e(Nd, Hf) compositions which systematically vary with Sm/Nd, Nb/U and Nb/La ratios. Geological and geochemical evidence shows that the Warrawoona Group was erupted onto continental basement, and that these basalts assimilated small amounts of Carlindi granitoid. As the Coonterunah basalts have similar compositions, they probably formed likewise, although they were deposited &gt;60 myr before. Indeed, such a model may be applicable to most other early Pilbara greenstone successions, and so an older continental basement was probably critical for early Pilbara evolution.  The geochemical, geological and geophysical characteristics of the Pilbara greenstone successions can be best explained as flood basalt successions deposited onto thin, submerged continental basement. This magmatism was induced by thermal upwelling in the mantle, although the basalts themselves do not have compositions which reflect derivation from an anomalously hot mantle. The Carlindi granitoids probably formed by fusion of young garnet-hornblende-rich sialic crust induced by basaltic volcanism.   Early Archaean rocks have Nd-Hf isotope compositions which indicate that the young mantle had differentiated into distinct isotopic domains before 4.0 Ga. Such ancient depletion was associated with an increase of mantle Nb/U ratios to modern values, and hence this event probably reflects the extraction of an amount of continental crust equivalent to its modern mass from the primitive mantle before 3.5 Ga. Thus, a steady-state model of crustal growth is favoured whereby post ~4.0 Ga continental additions have been balanced by recycling back into the mantle, with no net global flux of continental crust at modern subduction zones. It is also proposed that the decoupling of initial e(Nd) and e(Hf) from its typical covariant behaviour was related to the formation of continental crust, perhaps by widespread formation of TTG magmas.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Archaeon;Pilbara Craton;crustal evolution;elemental geochemistry;Nd isotopes;Hf isotopes;SHRIMP U-Pb dating;continental crust</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic Oxidation of 4-t-butyltoluene</field><field name="creator">Anwar Amin, Ahmed</field><field name="description">The oxidation of 4-t-butyltoluene in glacial acetic acid by hydrogen peroxid in a process catalysed by cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate and sodium bromide has been studied with the aim of increasing the selectivity towards 4-t-butylbenzaldehyde.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">catalysis;oxidation;4-t-butyltoluene;cobalt acetate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Health Impact of Pesticide Exposure in a Cohort of Outdoor Workers</field><field name="creator">Beard, John Roland</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a study undertaken between 1992 and 2001 to explore the possible health impacts of human exposure to pesticides.  The study followed the health outcomes of approximately 4000 outdoor workers over a period of up to sixty-one years.  These workers comprised two subcohorts of approximately even size, one composed of agricultural workers with high insecticide exposures, and the other made up of outdoor staff from local councils in the same area with little or no occupational exposure to insecticides. Mortality and morbidity were compared between the two groups, and with the general Australian community.    The study identifies significantly increased mortality among both exposed and control subjects when compared to the Australian population.  The major cause of this increase was mortality from smoking related diseases.  The study also identifies significant increases in mortality among exposed subjects for a number of conditions that do not appear to be the result of smoking patterns, both when compared to the control group and the Australian population.  These include pancreatic cancer in some DDT exposed subjects and asthma, diabetes, and leukaemia in subjects working with more modern chemicals.  There was also an increase in self reported chronic illness and asthma, and lower neuropsychological functioning scores among surviving exposed subjects when compared to controls.  Diabetes was also reported more commonly by subjects reporting occupational use of herbicides.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pesticides;DDT;cohort study;neoplasms;pancreatic cancer;leukemia;diabetes;asthma</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Change and Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique: A Study of the Charismatic Author-Leader</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Joanne</field><field name="description">In this thesis I explore the significance of the publication of Betty Friedan&#65533;s The Feminine Mystique (1963) to the emergence of the second wave Women&#65533;s Liberation Movement in the US in the late 1960s. To this end, I deploy key concepts provided through social movement theory (eg collective identity, collective action frames, social problem construction). I also incorporate Max Weber and Antonio Gramsci&#65533;s insights on the indispensable role played by leaders who demonstrate a clear and effective political will.     Weber&#65533;s three part model of pure charisma is used as a general template for understanding the impact of Friedan&#65533;s text. I critique aspects of Weber&#65533;s theory of charisma, in particular his failure to appreciate that the written word can mark the initial emergence phase of charisma rather than its routinisation. I augment Weber&#65533;s insights on charismatic leadership by attending to Gramsci&#65533;s emphasis on the necessity of winning the &#65533;war of ideas&#65533; that must be waged at the level of civil society within advanced capitalist societies. I examine Gramsci&#65533;s understanding of the power available to the organic intellectual who is aligned with the interests of subaltern groups and who succeeds in revealing the hegemonic commitments of accepted &#65533;common sense&#65533;.     In the latter part of this thesis, I apply these many useful concepts to my case study analysis of Betty Friedan&#65533;s The Feminine Mystique. I argue that Friedan&#65533;s accessible, middlebrow text gave birth to a new discursive politics which was critically important not only for older women, but for a younger generation of more radicalised women. I emphasise how Friedan&#65533;s text mounted a concerted attack on the discursive construction of femininity under patriarchal capitalism. I question Friedan&#65533;s diagnostic claim that the problems American women faced were adequately captured by the terminology of the trapped housewife syndrome.     I conclude by arguing that social movement researchers have to date failed to appreciate the leadership potential of the charismatic author-leader who succeeds in addressing and offering a solution to a pressing social problem through the medium of a best-selling, middlebrow text.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social movements;Friedan;charisma;author;womens liberation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum Chemical Studies of Thermochemistry, Kinetics and Molecular Structure.</field><field name="creator">Haworth, Naomi Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with a range of chemical problems which are amenable to theoretical investigation via the application of current methods of computational quantum chemistry. These problems include the calculation of accurate thermochemical data, the prediction of reaction kinetics, the study of molecular potential energy surfaces, and the investigation of molecular structures and binding.  The heats of formation (from both atomisation energies and isodesmic schemes) of a set of    approximately 120 C1 and C2 fluorocarbons and oxidised fluorocarbons (along with C3F6 and CF3CHFCF2) were calculated with the Gaussian-3 (G3) method (along with several approximations thereto). These molecules are of importance in the flame chemistry of 2-H-heptafluoropropane, which has been proposed as a potential fire retardant with which to replace chloro- and bromofluorocarbons (CFC&#65533;s and BFC&#65533;s). The calculation of the data reported here was carried out in parallel with the modelling studies of Hynes et al.1-3 of shock tube experiments on CF3CHFCF3 and on C3F6 with either hydrogen or oxygen atoms.   G3 calculations were also employed in conjunction with the experimental work of Owens et  al.4 to describe the pyrolysis of CFClBr2 (giving CFCl) at a radiation wavelength of 265 nm. The theoretical prediction of the dissociation energy of the two C-Br bonds was found to be consistent with the energy at which carbene production was first observed, thus supporting the hypothesis that the pyrolysis releases two bromine radicals (rather than a Br2 molecule). On the basis of this interpretation of the experiments, the heat of formation of CFClBr2 is predicted to be 184 &#65533; 5 kJ mol-1, in good agreement with the G3 value of 188 &#65533; 5 kJ mol-1.   Accurate thermochemical data was computed for 18 small phosphorus containing molecules (P2, P4, PH, PH2, PH3, P2H2, P2H4, PO, PO2, PO3, P2O, P2O2, HPO, HPOH, H2POH, H3PO, HOPO and HOPO2), most of which are important in the reaction model introduced by Twarowski5 for the combustion of H2 and O2 in the presence of phosphine. Twarowski reported that the H + OH recombination reaction is catalysed by the combustion products of PH3 and proposed two catalytic cycles, involving PO2, HOPO and HOPO2, to explain this observation. Using our thermochemical data we computed the rate coefficients of the most important reactions in these cycles (using transition state and RRKM theories) and confirmed that at 2000K both cycles have comparable rates and are significantly faster than the uncatalysed H + OH recombination.   The heats of formation used in this work on phosphorus compounds were calculated using the G2, G3, G3X and G3X2 methods along with the far more extensive CCSD(T)/CBS type scheme. The latter is based on the evaluation of coupled cluster energies using the correlation consistent triple-, quadruple- and pentuple-zeta basis sets and extrapolation to the complete basis set (CBS) limit along with core-valence correlation corrections (with counterpoise corrections for phosphorus atoms), scalar relativistic corrections and spin-orbit coupling effects. The CCSD(T)/CBS results are consistent with the available experimental data and therefore constitute a convenient set of benchmark values with which to compare the more approximate Gaussian-n results. The G2 and G3 methods were found to be of comparable accuracy, however both schemes consistently underestimated the benchmark atomisation energies. The performance of G3X is significantly better, having a mean absolute deviation (MAD) from the CBS results of 1.8 kcal mol-1, although the predicted atomisation energies are still consistently too low. G3X2 (including counterpoise corrections to the core-valence correlation energy for phosphorus) was found to give a slight improvement over G3X, resulting in a MAD of 1.5 kcal mol-1. Several molecules were also identified for which the approximations underlying the Gaussian-n methodologies appear to be unreliable; these include molecules with multiple or strained P-P bonds.   The potential energy surface of the NNH + O system was investigated using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p)) with the aim of determining the importance of this route in the production of NO in combustion reactions. In addition to the standard reaction channels, namely decomposition into NO + NH, N2 + OH and H + N2O via the ONNH intermediate, several new reaction pathways were also investigated. These include the direct abstraction of H by O and three product channels via the intermediate ONHN, giving N2 + OH, H + N2O and HNO + N. For each of the species corresponding to stationary points on the B3LYP surface, valence correlated CCSD(T) calculations were performed with the aug-cc-pVxZ (x = Q, 5) basis sets and the results extrapolated to the complete basis set limit. Core-valence correlation corrections, scalar relativistic corrections and spin orbit effects were also included in the resulting energetics and the subsequent calculation of thermochemical data. Heats of formation were also calculated using the G3X method. Variational transition state theory was used to determine the critical points for the barrierless reactions and the resulting B3LYP energetics were scaled to be compatible with the G3X and CCSD(T)/CBS values. As the results of modelling studies are critically dependent on the heat of formation of NNH, more extensive CCSD(T)/CBS calculations were performed for this molecule, predicting the heat of formation to be 60.6 &#65533; 0.5 kcal mol-1. Rate coefficients for the overall reaction processes were obtained by the application of multi-well RRKM theory. The thermochemical and kinetic results thus obtained were subsequently used in conjunction with the GRIMech 3.0 reaction data set in modelling studies of combustion systems, including methane / air and CO / H2 / air mixtures in completely stirred reactors. This study revealed that, contrary to common belief, the NNH + O channel is a relatively minor route for the production of NO.   The structure of the inhibitor Nd-(N'-Sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-L-ornithine, PSOrn, and the nature of its binding to the OTCase enzyme was investigated using density functional (B3LYP) theory. The B3LYP/6-31G(d) calculations on the model compound, PSO, revealed that, while this molecule could be expected to exist in an amino form in the gas phase, on complexation in the active site of the enzyme it would be expected to lose two protons to form a dinegative imino tautomer. This species is shown to bind strongly to two H3CNHC(NH2)2+ moieties (model compounds for arginine residues), indicating that the strong binding observed between inhibitor and enzyme is partially due to electrostatic interactions as well as extensive hydrogen bonding (both model Arg+ residues form hydrogen bonds to two different sites on PSO). Population analysis and hydrogen bonding studies have revealed that the intramolecular bonding in this species consists of either single or semipolar bonds (that is, S and P are not hypervalent) and that terminal oxygens (which, being involved in semipolar bonds, carry negative charges) can be expected to form up to 4 hydrogen bonds with residues in the active site.   In the course of this work several new G3 type methods were proposed, including G3MP4(SDQ) and G3[MP2(Full)], which are less expensive approximations to G3, and G3X2, which is an extension of G3X designed to incorporate additional electron correlation. As noted earlier, G3X2 shows a small improvement on G3X; G3MP4(SDQ) and G3[MP2(Full)], in turn, show good agreement with G3 results, with MAD&#65533;s of ~ 0.4 and ~ 0.5 kcal mol-1 respectively.   1.

An empirical study is undertaken to further investigate the operation of the legislation.  As part of the Enhanced Disclosure regime, the continuous disclosure provision was effective from 5 September 1994 as s1001A of the Corporations Law, now the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).  This statutory provision is replaced by s674, inserted by Schedule 2 to the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 (Cth), and effective from 11 March 2002.  The provision reinforces Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) listing rule 3.1.  The rule requires a listed disclosing entity to notify ASX immediately of information that would be expected to have a &#65533;material effect&#65533; on the share price of the company.    However, the disclosure requirement is weakened by a number of specific exemptions or &#65533;carve-outs&#65533; to listing rule 3.1.  If a reasonable person would not expect the information to be disclosed, and if the confidentiality of the information is maintained, then disclosure is not mandatory in special circumstances.     This study analyses 427 query notices, issued by ASX to listed companies from July 1995 to April 1996.  The queries request information concerning unexplained movements in a company&#65533;s share price or a failure to comply with the listing rules.  An analysis of the companies&#65533; replies to these notices provides a profile of the type of company that is likely to be queried.  The study also attempts to evaluate the extent to which these companies have relied on the &#65533;carve-outs&#65533; as an exemption to the regulation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Stock Exchange;continuous disclosure;corporation law Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Encouraging the Development of Deeper Learning and Personal Teaching Efficacy: Effects of Modifying the Learning Environment in a Preservice Teacher Education Program</field><field name="creator">Gordon, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Through the development and implementation of modified learning contexts, the current study encouraged undergraduate teacher education students to modify their approaches to learning by reducing their reliance on surface approaches and progressively adopting deeper approaches. This outcome was considered desirable because students who employed deep approaches would exit the course having achieved higher quality learning than those who relied primarily on surface approaches. It was expected that higher quality learning in a preservice teacher education program would also translate into greater self-confidence in the management of teaching tasks, leading to improvements in students&#65533; teaching self-efficacy beliefs.     Altered learning contexts were developed through the application of action research methodology involving core members of the teaching team. Learning activities were designed with a focus on co-operative small-group problem-based learning, which included multiple subtasks requiring variable outcome presentation modes. Linked individual reflection was encouraged by personal learning journals and learning portfolios. Students also provided critical analyses of their own learning during the completion of tasks, from both individual and group perspectives. Assessment methods included lecturer, peer and self-assessment, depending on the nature of the learning task. Often these were integrated, so that subtasks within larger ones were assessed using combinations of methods.     Learning approach theorists (Biggs, 1993a, 1999; Entwistle, 1986, 1998; Prosser &amp; Trigwell, 1999; Ramsden, 1992, 1997) contend that learning outcomes are directly related to the learning approaches used in their development. They further contend that the approach adopted is largely a result of students&#65533; intent, which in turn, is influenced by their perception of the learning context. The present study therefore aimed to develop an integrated and pervasive course-based learning context, constructively aligned (after: Biggs, 1993a, 1996), achievable within the normal constraints of a university program, that would influence students&#65533; adoption of deep learning approaches. The cognitive processes students used in response to the altered contexts were interpreted in accordance with self-regulatory internal logic (after: Bandura, 1986, 1991b; Zimmerman, 1989, 1998b).     Longitudinal quasi-experimental methods with repeated measures on non-equivalent dependent variables were applied to three cohorts of students. Cohort 1 represented the contrast group who followed a traditional program. Cohort 2 was the main treatment group to whom the modified program was presented. Cohort 3 represented a comparison group that was also presented with the modified program over a shorter period.    Student data on learning approach, teaching efficacy and academic attributions were gathered from repeated administrations of the Study Process Questionnaire (Biggs, 1987b), Teacher Efficacy Scale (Gibson &amp; Dembo, 1984) and Multidimensional-Multiattributional Causality Scale (Lefcourt, 1991). In addition, reflective journals, field observations and transcripts of interviews undertaken at the beginning and conclusion of the course, were used to clarify students&#65533; approaches to learning and their responses to program modifications.     Analyses of learning approaches adopted by Cohorts 1 and 2 revealed that they both began their course predominantly using surface approaches. While students in Cohort 1 completed the course with approximately equal reliance on deep and surface approaches, students in Cohort 2 reported a predominant use of deep approaches on course completion. The relative impact of the modified learning context on students with differing approaches to learning in this cohort were further explained through qualitative data and cluster analyses. The partial replication of the study with Cohort 3, across the first three semesters of their program, produced similar effects to those obtained with Cohort 2.    The analyses conducted with teaching efficacy data indicated a similar pattern of development for all cohorts. Little change in either personal or general dimensions was noted in the first half of the program, followed by strong growth in both, in the latter half. While a relationship between learning approach usage and teaching efficacy was not apparent in Cohort 1, developmental path and mediation analyses indicated that the use of deep learning approaches considerably influenced the development of personal teaching efficacy in Cohort 2.     The current research suggests that value lies in the construction of learning environments, in teacher education, that enhance students&#65533; adoption of deep learning approaches. The nature of the task is complex, multifaceted and context specific, most likely requiring the development of unique solutions in each environment. Nevertheless, this research demonstrates that such solutions can be developed and applied within the prevailing constraints of pre-existing course structures.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learning approach;deep learning;surface learning;adapted learning methods;locus of control;teaching efficacy;personal efficacy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forward dynamic modelling of cycling for  people with spinal cord injury.</field><field name="creator">Sinclair, Peter James</field><field name="description">A forward dynamic model was developed to predict the performance of Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) individuals cycling an isokinetic ergometer using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (NMES) to elicit contractions of the quadriceps, hamstring and gluteal muscles. Computer simulations were performed using three inter-connected models: a kinematic model of segmental linkages, a muscle model predicting forces in response to stimulation, and a kinetic model predicting ergometer pedal forces resulting from muscle stimulation.    Specific model parameters for SCI individuals were determined through measurements from isometric and isokinetic contractions of the quadriceps muscles elicited using surface stimulation. The muscle model was fitted to data resulting from these isolated experiments in order to tailor the model's parameters to characteristics of muscles from SCI individuals. Isometric data from a range of knee angles were used to fit tendon slack lengths to the rectus femoris and vastus muscles. Adjustments to the quadriceps moment arm function were not able to improve the match between measured and modelled knee extension torques beyond those using moment arms taken from available literature. Similarly, literature values for constants from the muscle force - velocity relationship provided a satisfactory fit to the decline in torque with angular velocity, and parameter fitting did not improve this fit. Passive visco-elastic resistance remained constant for all velocities of extension except the highest (240 deg/s). Since knee angular velocities this high were not experienced during cycling, a visco-elastic dampener was not included within the present cycling model.    The rise and fall in torque following NMES onset and cessation were used to fit constants to match the rate of change in torque. Constants for the rise in torque following NMES onset were significantly altered by changes in knee angle, with more extended angles taking longer for torque to rise. This effect was small, however, within the range of angles used during cycling, and consequently was not included within the cycling model. The decline in torque after NMES cessation was not affected by knee angle. A period of five minutes cyclical isometric activity of the quadriceps resulted in torque declining by more than 75% from rested levels. The activation time constants were largely unaffected by this fatigue, however, with only a small increase in the time for torque to decline, and no change in rise time or the delay between stimulation changes and resulting torque changes. The cycling model, therefore, did not incorporate any effect for changes in activation timing with fatigue.    Performance of the full model was evaluated through measurements taken from SCI individuals cycling a constant velocity ergometer using NMES elicited contractions of the quadriceps, hamstring and gluteal muscles. Pedal transducers measured forces applied to the pedals for comparison between measured and modelled values. A five minute period of continuous cycling using just the quadriceps muscles produced similar results to those found for isolated knee extension. External power output dropped by 50% over the five-minute period, however there was no change in the pattern of torque production with fatigue.     Cycling experiments were conducted using single muscle groups across a range of NMES firing angles. Experimental protocols were designed to seek the firing angles for each muscle that maximised power output by that group. Changes in power output in response to firing angle changes were not large, however, in comparison to the effects of cumulative fatigue and inconsistent power output between trials. This lead to large uncertainties in the determination of those firing angles that maximised power output by each muscle. Results suggest that NMES firing angles to maximise power output by the quadriceps muscles were relatively similar for each subject. For the hamstring muscles, however, substantial differences were observed in the range of firing angles that maximised power output. Results for the gluteal muscles were variable, with some subjects not applying any measurable torque to the cranks, even with maximal stimulation applied.     The model produced a good match to experimental data for the quadriceps muscles, both in the shape of pedal force curves and the firing angles that maximised external power output. The individual variability in hamstring responses was not, however, predicted by the model. Modification of the relative size of the hamstrings' moment arms about the hip and knee substantially improved the match between measured and modelled data. Analysis of results suggests that individual variability in the relative size of these moment arms is a major cause of variation in individual's response to hamstring stimulation. There were apparent limitations in the model's ability to predict the shape of crank torques resulting from stimulation of the gluteus maximus muscle. It is suggested that further research be conducted to enable modelling of this muscle using a range of fibre lengths and moment arms.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">computer simulation;muscle mechanics;spinal cord injury;functional electrical stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Denying intimacy: the role of reason and institutional order in the lives of people with an intellectual disability</field><field name="creator">Klotz, Jani Frances</field><field name="description">This thesis explores differences in the ways that intellectually disabled people are perceived, interpreted and related to within a Western context. Through a comparison of familial and institutionalised forms of relatedness, it examines the interrelation between these differences and the consequences that they have for either denying or acknowledging severely intellectually disabled people's capacities for sociality. Drawing on Carrithers' (1992) concept of sociality and mutuality, and Wittgenstein's (1953) notion of language games, the thesis analyses the means by which a meaningful and shared existence with intellectually disabled people can be negotiated and developed. Although limited and restricted in their capacities for symbolic expression, such people do have modalities of symbolic life upon which sociality can be built.  By analysing the symbolic practices utilised by my three profoundly intellectually disabled siblings, I seek to show how relationships across the difference of intellectual disability are able to be symbolically mediated and negotiated. I argue that it is necessary to engage in relations of mutual interdependence in order to even recognise and perceive these practices as purposeful and meaningful. The mutuality that ensues requires a level of intimacy, empathy and commitment that is not easily sustainable, but which is necessary for the maintenance of intellectually disabled people's existence as social beings. These intimate relations are contrasted with clinical and institutional forms of relatedness, both of which have been informed and shaped by a symbolic scheme of reason and normality. This symbolic scheme associates a capacity for reason with normal humanness, where reason is identified as particular abstract, linguistic, mental practices that are then deemed necessary for sociality. These are what intelligence tests measure, and it is through such assessments that intellectually disabled people are rendered asocial. The pathologising of intellectual disability as an abnormal embodiment, and the clinical tendency to search only for deficits in functioning and ability, has led to a denial or ignorance of intellectually disabled people's abilities to be the independent sustainers and authors of mutuality and sociality. I draw on my family's medical notes, records from the institution where two of my siblings were sent to live, as well as observations made during twelve months of fieldwork with a group of intellectually disabled people attending an activities centre, and either living in community group homes or with their families, to elucidate the ways in which such interpretations of intellectual disability become instituted into daily practice.  The instituting of training and management practices within day centres, group homes and institutions for the intellectually disabled are a consequence of the perception that intellectually disabled people have no capacity for sociality as they are. So too are the legal and structural obligations that inform the forms of relatedness that staff have with the intellectually disabled people with whom they work. These relations are based on separation and disengagement rather than mutuality and intimacy. The aim in these institutionalised environments is to instil in such people a range of normative social, domestic and vocational skills as though it is upon these that their capacity as social beings are dependent. As a result, the symbolic practices and dispositional behaviours through which intellectually disabled people express themselves are not recognised as such, nor are they engaged with. This undermines intellectually disabled people's capacity to be joint contributors to social life in a way which incorporates their differences rather than trying to transform them.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intellectual disability;disability studies;anthropology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NMR DIFFUSION MEASUREMENTS OF COMPARTMENTALIZED AND MULTICOMPONENT BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS: Studies of Tropoelastin, the Self Association of N Methylacetamide, and q-Space Analysis of Real and Model Cell Suspensions</field><field name="creator">Regan, David Gabriel</field><field name="description">Molecular diffusion is an inherent feature of all fluid systems. The processes and interactions that characterize these systems are in some way dependent upon the mobility of the component molecules. Pulsed field-gradient spin-echo nuclear magnetic resonance (PGSE NMR) is a powerful tool for the study of molecular diffusion; for heterogeneous systems, such as those typically found in biology, this technique is unsurpassed in the diversity of systems that yield to its probing. The aim of the work presented in this thesis was to use an integrated NMR-based approach, in conjunction with computer modeling, for the study of molecular diffusion in compartmentalized and multicomponent biological systems.  Erythrocyte suspensions provided an ideal experimental system for the study of compartmentalized diffusion in cells. Water exchanges rapidly between the intra- and extracellular regions and, as the major constituent of the cell, provides a strong and predominant proton NMR signal. In addition, the cells are known to align in the strong static magnetic field of the spectrometer. As a consequence of these two properties, the signal intensity from a suitably designed series of PGSE NMR experiments exhibits a series of maxima and minima when graphed as a function of the magnitude of the spatial wave number vector q. The apparently periodic phenomenon is mathematically analogous to optical diffraction and interference and is referred to here as diffusion-coherence. It is the characterization of this phenomenon, with the aid of computer-based models, which was the focus of a major section of the work described herein.  Two quite distinct molecular systems formed the basis of the work in which I investigated diffusion in multicomponent systems. Both systems involved molecules that undergo self-association such that at equilibrium a population distribution of different oligomeric species is present. The first of these was tropoelastin, the monomeric subunit of elastin, which under certain conditions aggregates to form a coacervate. The second system was N-methylacetamide (NMA) which also undergoes extensive self-association. NMA oligomers have previously been studied as peptide analogues due to the presence in the monomer of a peptide linkage. In this work the aim was to use PGSE NMR diffusion measurements, in a manner that is in many ways analogous to analytical ultracentrifugation, to obtain estimates of hydrodynamic and thermodynamic parameters. Computer modeling was also used extensively in this section of work for the interpretation of the experimental data.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">q-space;diffusion;tropoelastin;N-methylacetamide;nuclear magnetic resonance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Irish Astronomical Tract: A Case Study of Scientific Terminology in 14th Century Irish</field><field name="creator">Williams, John Alfred</field><field name="description">SYNOPSIS Included in this work, is a general historical overview of the development of astronomical knowledge in the West from the realms of Greek scholarship in classical times through to the Renaissance and the threshold of modern physics.

Also included are numerous incidental references to astronomical matters from both Irish and Latin literature during the Middle Ages. Attention is devoted to the surviving manuscript copies of the Tract and the question of its sources, origin and purpose. A possible Dominican context for the compilation and dissemination of the Tract is considered. A detailed commentary of the technical content of each chapter is presented, together with reference to contemporary developments in the West and to the occasional clues as to the institutional, geographical and chronological origins of the Tract. A study of the technical terminology used by the Irish compiler is presented in detail. Reference is made both to earlier Irish terminology where appropriate, as well as to the limitations imposed by the fact that many of the scientific concepts were yet to attain clarity that came with the advent of Newtonian physics, Copernican astronomy and post-Colombian geography. The data entries on ms Stowe B are evaluated and compared with computer generated data of astronomical movements in the 14th and 15th centuries with a view to ascertaining the time of compilation of the Tract and its working life. A A revised English translation of the Tract is included in the appendices together with Maxwell Close's unpublished commentary to relevant portions. An Irish edition, closely following the ITS edition of 1914 is also included. Corruptions to the text are footnoted together with the likely run of the original text.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irish Astronomical Tract;Irish Scientific Terminology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular aspects of biomolecule structure and function</field><field name="creator">Rodger, Alison</field><field name="description">All biological processes are fundamentally inter-molecular interactions. In order to understand, and hence control, biomolecular structure and function, methods are required that probe biological systems at the molecular level, ideally with those molecules being in their native environment.

The spectroscopy is complemented by fundamental theoretical work on molecular structure and reactivity that forms the basis for designing molecules to bind to biomolecules for a particular structural or functional effect.

This thesis examines the effects of delay and risk on personal investment decisions. The delay discounting literature is employed in developing a new parameter &#65533;ki&#65533; which integrates an investment&#65533;s term and interest rate with the hyperbolic delay discounting model. By indicating the extent to which compound interest growth compensates for hyperbolic delay discounting, ki should strongly predict the subjective appeal of prospective investment returns. Six binary-choice experiments test this hypothesis, especially via a subsidiary hypothesis that exponential growth from compound interest will eventually compensate for delay, given a sufficient term. Analyses include a novel application of signal detection principles, which found ki a superior predictor of investment appraisals compared to the normative exponential delay discounting model. Subject to boundary conditions of term and investment amount, results support the predictive capacity of ki for gross returns, implying a hitherto unrecognised degree of predictability for investment decisions. To investigate perceptions of risk with delay, three additional experiments compared preferences among hypothetical investments with varying risk and term. Risk seeking and risk aversion were detected, consistent with individual differences in hyperbolic probability discounting rates. Excessive risk aversion proved the greater problem, encouraging unnecessarily conservative investment decisions. Unexpectedly, no evidence of delay discounted risk was found. Responses consistent with higher probability discounting of larger amounts occurred, but only for a longer rather than a shorter investment term. A survey of postgraduate finance students examined how investment past performance is interpreted. Participants evaluated annual returns from hypothetical 10-year investments that varied in their mean return, volatility, and sequence of high and low returns. Evaluations generally reflected underlying investment properties. Maladaptive appraisal tendencies included unwarranted attention to the order in which high and low returns occurred within a series. Overall for this dissertation, results suggest that delay and probability discounting theory has practical relevance for understanding personal investment decisions. The principles and methodology in this dissertation are applicable to other varieties of financial and consumer behaviour.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">personal finance;investment;delay discounting;probability discounting;decision making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mediating Modernity - Henry Black and Narrated Hybridity in Meiji Japan</field><field name="creator">McArthur, Ian Douglas</field><field name="description">Henry Black was born in Adelaide in 1858, but arrived in Japan in 1864 after his father became editor of the Japan Herald. In the late 1870s, Henry Black addressed meetings of members of the Freedom and People&#65533;s Rights Movement. His talks were inspired by nineteenth-century theories of natural rights. That experience led to his becoming a professional storyteller (rakugoka) affiliated with the San&#65533;y&#65533; school of storytelling (San&#65533;yuha).   Black&#65533;s storytelling (rakugo) in the 1880s and 1890s was an attempt by the San&#65533;y&#65533;ha to modernise rakugo. By adapting European sensation fiction, Black blended European and Japanese elements to create hybridised landscapes and characters as blueprints for audiences negotiating changes synonymous with modernity during the Meiji period. The narrations also portrayed the negative impacts of change wrought through emulation of nineteenth-century Britain&#65533;s Industrial Revolution. His 1894 adaptation of Oliver Twist or his 1885 adaptation of Mary Braddon&#65533;s Flower and Weed, for example, were early warnings about the evils of child labour and the exploitation of women in unregulated textile factories.   Black&#65533;s kabuki performances parallel politically and artistically inspired attempts to reform kabuki by elevating its status as an art suitable for imperial and foreign patronage. The printing of his narrations in stenographic books (sokkibon) ensured that his ideas reached a wide audience.    Because he was not an officially hired foreigner (yatoi), and his narrations have not entered the rakugo canon, Black has largely been forgotten. A study of his role as a mediator of modernity during the 1880s and 1890s shows that he was an agent in the transfer to a mass audience of European ideas associated with modernity, frequently ahead of intellectuals and mainstream literature. An examination of Black&#65533;s career helps broaden our knowledge of the role of foreigners and rakugo in shaping modern Japan.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rakugo;Japan;Meiji period;storytelling;modernity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/518</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary structural optimisation as a robust and reliable design tool</field><field name="creator">Proos, Kaarel Andres</field><field name="description">Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) is a relatively new design tool used to improve and optimise the design of structures.  It is a heuristic method where a few elements of an initial design domain of finite elements are iteratively removed.  Such a process is carried out repeatedly until an optimum design is achieved, or until a desired given area or volume is reached.    There have been many contributions to the ESO procedure since its conception back in 1992.  For example, a provision known as Bi-Directional ESO (BESO) has now been incorporated where elements may not only be removed, but added.  Also, rather than deal with elements where they are either present or not, the designer now has the option to change the element's properties in a progressive fashion.  This includes the modulus of elasticity, the density of the material and the thickness of plate elements, and is known as Morphing ESO.  In addition to the algorithmic aspects of ESO, a large preference exists to optimise a structure based on a selection of criteria for various physical processes.  Such examples include stress minimisation, buckling and electromagnetic problems.    In a changing world that demands the enhancement of design tools and methods that incorporate optimisation, the development of methods like ESO to accommodate this demand is called for.  It is this demand that this thesis seeks to satisfy.  This thesis develops and examines the concept of multicriteria optimisation in the ESO process.  Taking into account the optimisation of numerous criteria simultaneously, Multicriteria ESO allows a more realistic and accurate approach to optimising a model in any given environment.    Two traditional methods &#65533; the Weighting method and the Global Criterion (Min-max) method have been used, as has two unconventional methods &#65533; the Logical AND method and the Logical OR method.  These four methods have been examined for different combinations of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) solver types.  This has included linear static FEA solver, the natural frequency FEA solver and a recently developed inertia FE solver.  Mean compliance minimisation (stiffness maximisation), frequency maximisation and moment of inertia maximisation are an assortment of the specific objectives incorporated.  Such a study has provided a platform to use many other criteria and multiple combinations of criteria.    In extending the features of ESO, and hence its practical capabilities as a design tool, the creation of another optimisation method based on ESO has been ushered in.  This method concerns the betterment of the bending and rotational performance of cross-sectional areas and is known as Evolutionary Moment of Inertia Optimisation (EMIO).  Again founded upon a domain of finite elements, the EMIO method seeks to either minimise or maximise the rectangular, product and polar moments of inertia.  This dissertation then goes one step further to include the EMIO method as one of the objectives considered in Multicriteria ESO as mentioned above.    Most structures, (if not all) in reality are not homogenous as assumed by many structural optimisation methods.  In fact, many structures (particularly biological ones) are composed of different materials or the same material with continually varying properties.  In this thesis, a new feature called Constant Width Layer (CWL) ESO is developed, in which a distinct layer of material evolves with the developing boundary.  During the optimisation process, the width of the outer surrounding material remains constant and is defined by the user.    Finally, in verifying its usefulness to the practical aspect of design, the work presented herein applies the CWL ESO and the ESO methods to two dental case studies.  They concern the optimisation of an anterior (front of the mouth) ceramic dental bridge and the optimisation of a posterior (back of the mouth) ceramic dental bridge.  Comparisons of these optimised models are then made to those developed by other methods.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">evolutionary structural optimisation;multiple criteria;optimisation;Pareto;inertia;dental bridge</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and Molecular Biological Studies in Hirschsprung's Disease</field><field name="creator">Croaker, Geoffrey David Hain</field><field name="description">HSCR has been felt to be a polygeneic disease on the basis of an incompletely penetrant sex modified transmission, which may be either autosomal dominant or recessive in different kindred.

This thesis records how such issues are reflected in contemporary literature, focusing on the emergence of popular culture and the best seller, a term which conflates author and novel. The first English best seller was Marie Corelli and, by way of introduction, Part I offers a summary of her life and her novels and a critical overview of her work.  Part II of the thesis examines how the theory of evolution undermined traditional religious belief and prompted the search for a new creed able to defy materialism and reconcile science and religion. Contemporary literature mirrors the consequent interest in spiritualism during the 1890s and the period immediately following the Great War, and critical readings of Corelli&#65533;s A Romance of Two Worlds and The Life Everlasting demonstrate that these novels - which form the nucleus of her personal theology, the Electric Creed - are based on selections from the New Testament, occultism and, in particular, science and spiritualism.  Part III of the thesis looks at the emergence of &#65533;the woman question&#65533;, the corresponding backlash by conservatives and the ways in which these conflicting views are explored in the popular literature of the time. A critical examination of the novella, My Wonderful Wife, reveals how Corelli uses social Darwinism in an ambivalent critique of the New Woman. Several of Corelli&#65533;s essays are discussed, showing that her views about the role of women were complex. A critical analysis of The Secret Power engages with Corelli&#65533;s peculiar kind of feminism, which would deny women the vote but envisages female scientists inventing and operating airships in order to secure the future of the human race.   Interest in Marie Corelli has re-emerged recently, particularly in occult and feminist circles. Corelli&#65533;s immense popularity also makes her an important figure in cultural studies. This thesis adds to the body of knowledge about Corelli in that it consciously endeavours to avoid spiritualist or feminist ideological frameworks, instead using contemporary science as a context for examining her work.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victorian literature;Edwardian literature;science and religion;science and spiritualism;science and feminism;science and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Direct simulation studies of suspended particles and fibre-filled suspensions</field><field name="creator">Joung, Clint Gwarngsoo</field><field name="description">A new Direct Simulation &#64257;bre model was developed which allowed &#64258;exibility  in the &#64257;bre during the simulation of &#64257;bre suspension &#64258;ow.This new model  was called the &#65533;Chain-of-Spheres &#65533;model.It was hypothesised that particle  shape and deformation could signi &#64257;cantly a &#64256;ect partic e dynamics,and also  suspension bulk properties such as viscosity.Data collected from the simulation showed that &#64258;exible &#64257;bres in shear &#64258;ow resulted in an order of 7 &#8722;10%  bulk relative viscosity increase over the &#65533;rigid &#65533;&#64257;bre result.Results also es-  tablished the existence of a relationship between bulk viscosity and particle  sti &#64256;ness.In comparison with experimental results,other more conventional  rigid &#64257;bre based methods appeared to underpredict relative viscosity.The  &#64258;exible &#64257;bre method thus markedly improved the ability to estimate relative  viscosity.The curved rigid &#64257;bre suspension also exhibited increased viscosity  of the order twice that of the equivalent straight rigid &#64257;bre suspension.With  such sensitivity to &#64257;bre shape,this result has some important implications  for the quality of &#64257;bre inclusions used.For consistent viscosity,the shape  quality of the &#64257;bres was shown to be important.  The &#65533;Chain of Spheres &#65533;simulation was substantially extended to create a  new simulation method with the ability to model the dynamics of arbitrarily  shaped particles in the Newtonian &#64258;ow &#64257;eld.This new &#65533;3D Particle &#65533;simulation method accounted for the inertial force on the particles,and also allowed  particles to be embedded in complex &#64258;ow &#64257;elds.This method was used to  reproduce known dynamics for common particle shapes,and then to predict  the unknown dynamics of various other particle shapes in shear &#64258;ow.

This decision to engage proactively with human rights was a radical expansion of the profession&#65533;s self-conception.     Applying an action research methodology, this study traces the development and implementation of the Free Access to Information and Freedom of Expression (FAIFE) initiative.  It traces the origins of the decision, and assesses the outcomes of its first five years as it developed from a project into a continuing and central program of the Federation.  Both the internal effects on IFLA and the consequences of the project for the profession of librarianship are explored.      The thesis locates the key decision in the history of librarianship, its growth as a profession paralleling the development of libraries as institutions.  In turn, the decision is also located in IFLA&#65533;s own history, and the way it survived and worked to advance the ideas and tools of librarianship amid difficult and changing international environments.     The politics of professionalism is at the core of the study.  The disturbing innovation which FAIFE represented took IFLA outside its traditional focus on the status and techniques of the profession, postulating a new role for the Federation.  By investing librarianship with a higher responsibility, it has gone further than the now widely accepted expectation that professionals will place community interests before organisational and personal interests at all times.  The responsibility to promote the fundamental human right to information has been embraced as the key principle underlying and informing library and information service, the touchstone for evaluating professional priorities.  This locates the primary purpose of the profession outside the profession&#65533;s institutional base in a supranational, absolute and almost universally recognised social goal.        Adopting these aspirations and this role carried many dangers for IFLA.  It would inevitably seem a deviation into politics by some.  It heightened the risks of both internal dissent and external criticism.  It challenged the habitus of disinterested professionalism by invoking a more interventionist social responsibility for IFLA, its constituent library associations and the broader profession. It drew on evolving and contested understandings of professional responsibilities in a complex global environment and has redrawn the accepted boundaries of professional discourse in librarianship.       At least so far, the consequences have been beneficial for IFLA, reinforcing its jurisdiction and strengthening the Federation.  As an international federation of professional associations, IFLA faces particular challenges in working across diverse national traditions, ideologies and cultures.  Its existence and effectiveness rest primarily on internal cohesiveness.  Its capacity to develop the FAIFE initiative into a program without schism, and indeed with growing support, has strengthened rather than weakened its organisational capacities.  Through that process IFLA has reinvented itself, to a considerable degree, as a form of transnational social movement organisation.  It has developed strong relationships with other civil society organisations while maintaining its position as a respected international professional body.  It has strengthened its position by becoming a vigorous advocate for the right to information, thereby becoming an actor in the growing international concern with human rights.     This study of a decisive period in IFLA&#65533;s history offers a rare example of an international professional association in transition.  In examining this project to promote unrestricted access to information as the reciprocal right of freedom of expression, the research is a case study of the politics of an expanding sense of professionalism.  IFLA&#65533;s experience is pertinent to a range of other organisations, and is itself part of the realignment of international political discourse in response to the growing influence of international organisations and the priority of human rights in international political agendas.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">freedom of expression;human rights;librarianship;freedom of information</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of an Analog VLSI Cochlea</field><field name="creator">Shiraishi, Hisako</field><field name="description">The cochlea is an organ which extracts frequency information from the input sound wave. It also produces nerve signals, which are further analysed by the brain and ultimately lead to perception of the sound.  An existing model of the cochlea by Fragni`ere is first analysed by simulation. This passive model is found to have the properties that the living cochlea does in terms of the frequency response.  An analog VLSI circuit implementation of this cochlear model in CMOS weak inversion is proposed, using log-domain filters in current domain. It is fabricated on a chip and a measurement of a basilar membrane section is performed. The measurement shows a reasonable agreement to the model. However, the circuit is found to have a problem related to transistor mismatch, causing different behaviour in identical circuit blocks.  An active cochlear model is proposed to overcome this problem. The model incorporates the effect of the outer hair cells in the living cochlea, which controls the quality factor of the basilar membrane filters. The outer hair cells are incorporated as an extra voltage source in series with the basilar membrane resonator. Its value saturates as the input signal becomes larger, making the behaviour rather closer to that of a passive model. The simulation results show this nonlinear phenomenon, which is also seen in the living cochlea.  The contribution of this thesis is summarised as follows: a) the first CMOS weak inversion current domain basilar membrane resonator is designed and fabricated, and b) the first active two-dimensional cochlear model for analog VLSI implementation is developed.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">analog VLSI;2-D;cochlea;CMOS weak inversion;log-domain filter;outer hair cells</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temperature-dependent sex determination in the viviparous lizard Eulamprus tympanum</field><field name="creator">Robert, Kylie Anne</field><field name="description">Abstract        There are a remarkable variety of sex determination systems among different animal taxa. In most animals, sex is determined chromosomally. Although in an increasing number of animals sex determination has been found to be influenced primarily by the environment. Species with genotypic sex determination (GSD) have their sex determined at the time of fertilization, by genetic factors alone and those with environmental sex determination (ESD) have their sex determined by environmental factors that act after fertilization. Temperature-dependent Sex Determination (TSD), whereby the sex of the developing embryos depends on the temperature at which they develop is widespread in oviparous reptiles and occurs in all crocodilians, marine turtles and tuatara examined to date and is common in many freshwater turtles and lizards.    SECTION ONE  Temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) was never expected to occur in viviparous reptiles, as thermoregulation by pregnant females would result in relatively stable gestation temperatures. Temperature-dependent sex determination and viviparity goes against all the basic assumptions that TSD occurs in oviparous reptiles where temperatures within a nest vary widely. However, skewed sex ratios as a result of incubation temperature indicated the possibility of TSD in the viviparous lizard Eulamprus tympanum. In my first experiments I show the first recorded case of a viviparous reptile with TSD. The developing embryos of the viviparous skink E. tympanum are subject to TSD, with gestation temperature having a highly significant effect on sex and warmer temperatures giving rise to male offspring (Chapter 1).     Sex is fully determined at the time of birth and can be differentiated histologically into testes or ovaries (Chapter 2). The morphology and histological characteristics of the gonads of neonatal E. tympanum resulting from the treatment temperatures described in chapter 1 illustrate that sex in E. tympanum is easily distinguished at the time of birth and corresponds with the presence or absence of hemipenes. Males are histologically characterised by an elongated gonad consisting of seminiferous tubules with either no cortical epithelium or, if present at all, in a very thin band. If they are present, M&#65533;llerian ducts, showing signs of degeneration, are attached to the kidney by a shortened mesosalpinx. Females are histologically characterised by an irregularly shaped gonad consisting of a thick cortical epithelium that occasionally contains oocytes. The M&#65533;llerian ducts are obvious structures attached to the kidney by a fibrous mesosalpinx. The presence or absence of hemipenes is a reliable technique for determining sex in newborn E. tympanum. Sex determination is easiest to perform on neonates within the first few days of birth as hemipenes become increasingly difficult to evert as neonates age, however, with practice they are easily identified without full eversion.    SECTION TWO  The thermal biology of E. tympanum in the field is restricted by both the thermal properties of their habitat (Chapter 3) and behavioural modifications when faced with a predation threat (Chapter 4).     The available temperatures in the field suggest that TSD is biologically relevant in the species and not just a laboratory artefact; E. tympanum can attain mean selected temperatures achieved in the laboratory but the proportion of time at the temperature is restricted. Females actively thermoregulate in the field, although they are restricted in their efficiency of thermoregulation by environmental constraints, for example, microhabitat structure, weather conditions, predator avoidance and social ranking. The highly territorial nature and high densities of E. tympanum present in Kanangra Boyd National Park potentially force less dominant individuals into less favourable habitats that are significantly cooler. An important point is that gravid females in more favourable habitats in the period encompassing the middle third of development (the assumed sex determining period) are selecting higher temperatures, with lower variance and have greater thermoregulatory efficiency than during the rest of pregnancy, therefore, thermoregulating more precisely during this thermosensitive period (Chapter 3).     Chemosensory cues provide important information on the risk of predation. Hence, chemoreception is a common mechanism used by many species to detect the presence of, and subsequently respond to, a potential predator. The perceived risk of predation may force retreat to sub-optimal conditions, forcing a trade-off between the risk of predation and the ability to acquire resources. The basking regime maintained by gravid female E. tympanum, can directly alter sex ratios of offspring produced through temperature-dependent sex determination (Chapter 1). The avoidance of predator scents may restrict basking ability and in turn alter the sex of offspring produced. I measured responsiveness to chemical cues using tongue flicks as an indicator of chemical discrimination in females of different reproductive condition. I then measured activity and basking behaviour of gravid and non-gravid females in experimental enclosures in the presence of various chemical stimuli to determine if basking opportunity is compromised by the presence of a predator scent. Females respond differently depending upon reproductive condition, with gravid females responding most significantly to a predator scent. Activity, basking frequency, and time spent in the open (basking duration) are significantly reduced in gravid females in the presence of a predator stimulus. Under laboratory conditions, gravid females modify their behaviour and forego the opportunity to bask when there is a perceived predation risk (Chapter 4).    SECTION THREE  As female viviparous reptiles can regulate the temperature of the embryo by maternal temperature selection (Chapter 1), the occurrence of TSD in E. tympanum opens the possibility for females to select the sex of offspring. Reproducing females may benefit by facultatively adjusting their investment into sons over daughters or vice versa, in response to population wide shifts in adult sex ratios. Female E. tympanum, can manipulate the sex of their offspring in response to sex imbalances in the population using temperature-dependent sex determination (Chapter 5). When adult males are scarce, females produce male-biased litters and when adult males are common, females produce female-biased litters. The cues used by a female to assess the adult population are not known, but presumably depends upon the female&#65533;s experience throughout the breeding season and is the subject of further investigation (Chapter 6). The maternal manipulation of offspring sex ratio in E. tympanum suggests a selective advantage of temperature-dependent sex determination.    Any facultative sex ratio response needs to recognise the scarcity of one sex in order to overproduce that sex in the next generation; offspring sex ratio will vary inversely with adult sex ratio. Maternal sex allocation in E. tympanum is linked with population (or adult) sex ratio (Chapter 5), and one of the mechanisms by which females recognise an imbalance may be linked to visual recognition of males (Chapter 6). Females maintained throughout pregnancy without any male stimulus produce entirely male offspring (Chapter 5). In contrast females exposed to male stimulus produce both sexes (Chapter 5). Females respond differently to varying degrees of male stimulus and visual recognition of males in a population may be more important than chemoreception. In the absence of visual cues, females produce more male offspring, even when chemosensory cues are present (Chapter 6).    The study system presented here offers many advantages over oviparous species with TSD, due to E. tympanum being relatively short lived and fast maturing. Thus, the fitness consequences over multiple generations as a result of gestation can be investigated. Viviparity allows maternal control of embryonic temperature during gestation and a means of maternal sex allocation. Until now the maternal side of TSD and sex allocation has been where the mother deposits her eggs and the allocation of sex steroid hormones at oviposition, both of which have been difficult to study. The work presented and the study system itself should inspire great interest in TSD and viviparous reptiles.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viviparous;Lizard;TSD;Temperature-dependent sex determination</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colour Terms, Syntax and Bayes Modelling Acquisition and Evolution</field><field name="creator">Dowman, Mike</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates language acquisition and evolution, using the methodologies of Bayesian inference and expression-induction modelling, making specific reference to colour term typology, and syntactic acquisition. In order to test Berlin and Kay&#65533;s (1969) hypothesis that the typological patterns observed in basic colour term systems are produced by a process of cultural evolution under the influence of universal aspects of human neurophysiology, an expression-induction model was created. Ten artificial people were simulated, each of which was a computational agent. These people could learn colour term denotations by generalizing from examples using Bayesian inference, and the resulting denotations had the prototype properties characteristic of basic colour terms. Conversations between these people, in which they learned from one-another, were simulated over several generations, and the languages emerging at the end of each simulation were investigated. The proportion of colour terms of each type correlated closely with the equivalent frequencies found in the World Colour Survey, and most of the emergent languages could be placed on one of the evolutionary trajectories proposed by Kay and Maffi (1999). The simulation therefore demonstrates how typological patterns can emerge as a result of learning biases acting over a period of time. Further work applied the minimum description length form of Bayesian inference to modelling syntactic acquisition. The particular problem investigated was the acquisition of the dative alternation in English. This alternation presents a learnability paradox, because only some verbs alternate, but children typically do not receive reliable evidence indicating which verbs do not participate in the alternation (Pinker, 1989). The model presented in this thesis took note of the frequency with which each verb occurred in each subcategorization, and so was able to infer which subcategorizations were conspicuously absent, and so presumably ungrammatical. Crucially, it also incorporated a measure of grammar complexity, and a preference for simpler grammars, so that more general grammars would be learned unless there was sufficient evidence to support the incorporation of some restriction. The model was able to learn the correct subcategorizations for both alternating and non-alternating verbs, and could generalise to allow novel verbs to appear in both constructions. When less data was observed, it also overgeneralized the alternation, which is a behaviour characteristic of children when they are learning verb subcategorizations. These results demonstrate that the dative alternation is learnable, and therefore that universal grammar may not be necessary to account for syntactic acquisition. Overall, these results suggest that the forms of languages may be determined to a much greater extent by learning, and by cumulative historical changes, than would be expected if the universal grammar hypothesis were correct.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">colour terms;syntax;Bayes Modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A CLINICAL STUDY OF INHALANT ANAESTHESIA IN DOGS</field><field name="creator">Pottie, Robert George</field><field name="description">A clinical trial was undertaken using three different inhalant anaesthetic agents and one intravenous anaesthetic agent in dogs undergoing routine desexing surgery.   Healthy adult dogs undergoing either ovariohysterectomy or castration were assessed as to their demeanour, with the more excitable dogs being placed in groups receiving premedication with acepromazine and morphine. All dogs were then randomly assigned an anaesthetic agent for induction of general anaesthesia. The agents were the inhalants halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane, and the intravenous agent propofol. Inhalant inductions were undertaken using a tight fitting mask attached to a standard anaesthetic machine with a rebreathing circuit, with the maximum dose of inhalant available from a standard vaporiser. Propofol inductions were undertaken via intravenous catheter. Dogs induced with propofol were randomly assigned one of the three inhalant agents for maintenance. Those induced by inhalant agent were maintained using the same agent. The surgical procedure was undertaken in standard fashion, as was recovery from anaesthesia. All dogs received the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent meloxicam.  Data collection was divided into three stages: induction, maintenance, and recovery from anaesthesia. Variables measured at induction of anaesthesia were time to intubation, number of intubation attempts, tolerance of mask, quality of induction and quality of transfer to the maintenance stage. Standard variables for monitoring of anaesthesia were recorded throughout the maintenance of anaesthesia. Variables measured at recovery were time to righting, time to standing and quality of recovery.  The mean time to intubation when using the newer inhalant sevoflurane (196.2 &#65533; 14.8sec, mean &#65533; SE) was not significantly different to that for halothane (221.4 &#65533; 14.0sec) or isoflurane (172.4 &#65533; 15.0sec). Time to intubation with isoflurane was significantly faster than with halothane. Mean time to intubation with propofol (85.4 &#65533; 7.7sec) was significantly faster than that for any of the three inhalants. Choice of inhalant had no effect on quality of induction. The use of premedication significantly improved the quality of induction.  The use of propofol for induction likewise significantly improved the quality of induction.   Standard cardiorespiratory variables measured during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia remained within normal clinical ranges for all three inhalants, and were therefore not further analysed.   Choice of inhalant agent had no significant effect on the time to righting or standing in recovery. The use of propofol for induction had no effect on these variables. Animals placed in groups receiving premedication had significantly longer times to righting and standing. The oesophageal temperature at the end of the procedure had a significant effect on times to righting and standing, with lower temperatures contributing to slower recoveries. Independent of procedure time, male dogs had shorter times to righting than female dogs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">anaesthesia;dog;halothane;isoflurane;sevofurane;propofol;induction;recovery;temperature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and Numerical Investigation of the Physics of Microstructured Optical Fibres</field><field name="creator">Kuhlmey, Boris T</field><field name="description">We describe the theory and implementation of a multipole method for calculating the modes  of microstructured optical fibers (MOFs).

This thesis describes three series of compression tests performed on box-section stub columns, box-section long columns and lipped channel section columns cold-formed from high strength steel plates in 0.42 mm or 0.60 mm thickness with nominal yield stress of 550 MPa. The tests presented in this thesis formed  part of an Australian Research Council research project entitled: Compression Stability of High Strength Steel Sections with Low Strain-Hardening.    For the fix-ended stub column tests, a total of 94 lipped-square and hexagonal section stub columns were tested to study the influence of low strain hardening of G550 steel on the compressive section capacities of the column members. For the pin-ended long column tests, a total of 28 box-section columns were tested to study the stability of members with sections which undergo local instability at loads significantly less than the ultimate loads. For the fix-ended lipped channel section columns, a total of 21 stub and long columns were tested to study the failure resulting from local and distortional buckling with interaction between the modes.    A numerical simulation on the three series of tests using the commercial finite element computer program ABAQUS is also presented as part of this thesis. The post-buckling behaviour of thin-walled compression members is investigated. The effect of changing variables, such as geometric imperfections and end boundary conditions is also investigated. The ABAQUS analysis gives accurate simulations of the tests and is in good agreement to the experimental results.     Theoretical studies using finite strip methods are presented in this thesis to investigate the buckling behaviour of cold-formed members in compression. The theoretical studies provide valuable information on the local and distortional buckling stresses for use in the interaction buckling studies. The finite strip models used are the semi-analytical and spline models.    As expected for the stub columns tests, the greatest effect of low strain hardening was for the stockier sections where material properties play an important role. For the more slender sections where elastic local buckling and post-local buckling are more important, the effect of low strain hardening does not appear to be as significant. The pin-ended and fix-ended long column tests show that interaction, which is between local and overall buckling in the box sections, and between local and distortional buckling in the open channel sections, has a significant effect on their member capacities.    The results of the successful column tests and ABAQUS simulation have been compared with the design procedures in the Australian &amp; New Zealand Standard for Cold-Formed Steel Structures AS&amp;NZS 4600 and the North American Specification for Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members prepared by the American Iron and Steel Institute. The stub column tests show that the current design rules give too conservative predictions on the compressive section capacities of the column members; whereas the long column tests show that the current column design rules are unconservative if used in their current form for G550 steel.     Three design proposals are presented in this thesis to account for the effects of high strength thin steels on the section and member capacities.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High Strength Steel;Compression;Stub Column;Long Column;Local Buckling;Distortional Buckling;Interaction;Box and Lipped Channel Sections</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Comparative Analysis of Socio-Legal and Psycho-Social Theories and the Construction of a Model to Explain How Law Operates and Evolves in the Dependency Court</field><field name="creator">Sinclair, Kate</field><field name="description">This thesis examines data and theory about how the system of law (SL) operates and evolves:  it contrasts data from social workers and attorneys working in the juvenile dependency court with theories about how individuals and social systems evolve.  The analysis is based on research conducted in San Diego and revolves around a theory about human development, or the "individual as a system" (HD), and a theory about social systems, such as the autopoietic theory of law and its self-reproducing system (LA).  It is suggested that together, the theories of HD+LA help to examine how professionals and law operate and evolve in the legal system.   Overall, the thesis rejects the autopoietic systems theory that law reproduces itself, by itself.  Instead, analysis in this study supports the finding that law is defined and operates through a dialectic of the individual and the social (or the organic and the mechanistic respectively) such that each gives rise to the other.  On the basis of this system connection, aspects from systems theory about legal autopoiesis are integrated into concepts from constructive-developmental theory (HDLA), thus providing a new framework through which to examine how law and its system functions.  The new framework is built around an equation that emerged some time after data analysis and theoretical development: SL&amp;equals;HDLA+DSA .  The equation states that:    The  evolution of the system of law involves processes of human development and to some but a much lesser degree, the autopoietic nature of law.  The extent of this evolution is best determined by analyzing data from a court setting.  The dialectical relationship between individual and social influences in the evolution of law is facilitated by the accumulation of social action &#65533; such as activity from media and advocacy groups &#65533; and the individual meaning that professionals make about this action, which in turn has an influence on the formal and informal operations that they perform when operating law.   The nature of these interacting dynamics will be shown through two interconnected tools of analysis:  one is a typology of individual, professional and system self-concepts; the typology helps to show how a cycle of system change (human development giving rise to legal change and vice versa) occurs in the court; the other is the operative structure (or culture) of systems for law and social work in child abuse cases &#65533; which unite in court operations.  These two  interconnected tools help to show how the court operates and how social action (SA) for change contributes to professional and system change in the evolution of law.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">socio-legal theory;Psychology developmental theory;psycho-social theory;Child protection systems;Social work;Children's Dependency Court</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recovery following pneumonectomy: patients initial 2 year experience</field><field name="creator">McLean, Jocelyn Margaret</field><field name="description">Little is known about the recovery of patients after pneumonectomy and the impact of the surgery on the lifestyle of young, employed, ex-smokers and their families. This study was conducted to address this knowledge deficit, and gather information that would help    health professionals to be able to assist people facing pneumonectomy.   A qualitative study using van Manens methodological approach to interpretive phenomenology was chosen, in order to capture a full and rich understanding and meaning of the phenomenon that patients live.   The names, age, operation, histological cell type, stage of disease, and disease free status of potential participants were obtained from a Lung Cancer Surgical Database after obtaining ethical approval for the study. Nine participants (three females and six males) met the inclusion criteria and gave informed consent for the study. Data collection comprised of open-ended interviews that were audiotaped, then transcribed verbatim into hard data. Data interpretation was based on the selective reading approach of van Manen from which six thematic statements arose. These are living the discomforts of treatment and recovery, discovering new limitations on myself; functional and emotional, my reliance on support, my financial security is threatened, my survival is at threat, and I wish I had known more.     The study found that each participant had a unique experience of recovery and consequently the degree of recovery attained varied between participants. They all had a very strong desire to survive lung cancer and considered the risks of major surgery and loosing a lung to be insignificant compared to the certainty of loosing their life if they did not undergo surgery.   This study provided a glimpse of what it was like for a group of patients to live the experience of life after a pneumonectomy and it provides a basis from which nurses can explore further the experiences of patients who are subjected to lung cancer surgery.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pneumonectomy;lung cancer;thoracotamy;cancer;life after pneumonectomy;discomfort;lung</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein Design Based on a PHD Scaffold</field><field name="creator">Kwan, Ann Hau Yu</field><field name="description">The plant homeodomain (PHD) is a protein domain of ~45&#65533;100 residues characterised by a Cys4-His-Cys3 zinc-binding motif. When we commenced our study of the PHD in 2000, it was clear that the domain was commonly found in proteins involved in transcription. Sequence alignments indicate that while the cysteines, histidine and a few other key residues are strictly conserved, the rest of the domain varies greatly in terms of both amino acid composition and length. However, no structural information was available on the PHD and little was known about its function. We were therefore interested in determining the structure of a PHD in the hope that this might shed some light on its function and molecular mechanism of action.  Our work began with the structure determination of a representative PHD, Mi2b-P2, and this work is presented in Chapter 3. Through comparison of this structure with the two other PHD structures that were determined during the course of our work, it became clear that PHDs adopt a well-defined globular fold with a superimposable core region. In addition, PHDs contain two loop regions (termed L1 and L3) that display increased flexibility and overlay less well between the three PHD structures available. These L1 and L3 regions correspond to variable regions identified earlier in PHD sequence alignments, indicating that L1 and L3 are probably not crucial for the PHD fold, but are instead likely to be responsible for imparting function(s) to the PHD. Indeed, numerous recent functional studies of PHDs from different proteins have since demonstrated their ability in binding a range of other proteins.  In order to ascertain whether or not L1 and L3 were in fact dispensable for folding, we made extensive mutations (including both insertions and substitutions) in the loop regions of Mi2b-P2 and showed that the structure was maintained. We then went on to illustrate that a new function could be imparted to Mi2b-P2 by inserting a five-residue CtBP-binding motif into the L1 region and showed this chimera could fold and bind CtBP.  Having established that the PHD could adopt a new binding function, we next sought to use combinatorial methods to introduce other novel functions into the PHD scaffold. Phage display was selected for this purpose, because it is a well-established technique and has been used successfully to engineer zinc-binding domains by other researchers. However, in order to establish this technique in our laboratory, we first chose a control system in which two partner proteins were already known to interact in vitro.   We chose the protein complex formed between the transcriptional regulators LMO2 and ldb1 as a test case. We have examined this interaction in detail in our laboratory, and determined its three-dimensional structure. Furthermore, inappropriate formation of this complex is implicated in the onset of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We therefore sought to use phage display to engineer ldb1 mimics that could potentially compete against wild-type ldb1 for LMO2, and this work is described in Chapter 4. Using a phage library containing ~3 x 10 7 variants of the LMO2-binding region of ldb1, we isolated mutants that were able to interact with LMO2 with higher affinity and specificity than wild-type ldb1. These ldb1 mutants represent a first step towards finding potential therapeutics for treating LMO-associated diseases.  Having established phage display in our laboratory, we went on to search for PHD mutants that could bind selected target proteins. This work is described in Chapter 5. We created three PHD libraries with eight randomized residues in each of L1, L3 or in both loops of the PHD. These PHD libraries were then screened against four target proteins. After four rounds of selection, we were able to isolate a PHD mutant (dubbed L13-FH6) that could bind our test protein Fli-ets. This result demonstrates that a novel function can be imparted to the PHD using combinatorial methods and opens the way for further work in applying the PHD scaffold to other protein design work.  In summary, the work detailed in Chapters 3 and 5 demonstrates that the PHD possesses many of the properties that are desirable for a protein scaffold for molecular recognition, including small size, stability, and a well-characterised structure. Moreover, the PHD motif possesses two loops (L1 and L3) of substantial size that can be remodeled for target binding. This may lead to an enhancement of binding affinities and specificities over other small scaffolds that have only one variable loop. In light of the fact that PHDs are mainly found in nuclear proteins, it is reasonable to expect that engineered PHDs could be expressed and function in an intracellular environment, unlike many other scaffolds that can only function in an oxidizing environment. Therefore, our results together with other currently available genomic and functional information indicate PHD is an excellent candidate for a scaffold that could be used to modify cellular processes.

(1989). Since then offspring have been produced using sex-sorted spermatozoa from several different species (reviewed by Johnson, 2000). Initially, efficiency of the sex-sorting technology was poor with only low numbers of spermatozoa sorted per hour. Thus, the offspring derived from flow cytometrically sorted spermatozoa were produced with the use of artificial reproductive technologies (ART) such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and culture (IVC), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and deep artificial insemination (AI) which facilitated low dose insemination of potentially compromised spermatozoa. More recently, the development of high-speed sorters (Johnson and Welch, 1999) has facilitated the production of offspring using conventional AI techniques with low dose inseminates (Seidel et al., 1999) and successful cryopreservation of sorted spermatozoa (Schenk et al., 1999; Johnson et al., 2000; Lindsey et al., 2002; Schenk and DeGrofft, 2003). Increased efficiency of sorting bull spermatozoa has evolved through significant instrumentation and biological developments which have enabled the commercialization of the sperm sexing technology in the dairy industry, although conception rates in cows after low dose AI with sexed frozen-thawed spermatozoa are still lower than after standard frozen semen AI (Seidel et al., 1999). Subsequently, over 20 000 calves of pre-determined sex have been produced from commercially available sex-sorted frozen-thawed bull spermatozoa (Seidel, 2003). However, similar developments have not been made in the sheep industry and were examined in this thesis.  In this study, successful cryopreservation of sex-sorted ram spermatozoa and production of offspring of the pre-determined sex (X: 94.4 %; Y: 100 %) was achieved after low dose (2-4 x 106 total) insemination using conventional laparoscopic intrauterine (IU) AI. However, the overall pregnancy rate for ewes inseminated with sex-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa was low (25 %) compared to ewes inseminated with a commercial dose (140 x 106 total) of non-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa (54 %).    Cryopreservation has been found to not only reduce the proportion of motile spermatozoa, but cause the remaining spermatozoa to undergo changes that advance membrane maturation thereby shortening their lifespan, especially after in vivo fertilisation (Gillan and Maxwell, 1999). It was found that sorting prior to cryopreservation accelerated the maturation of sperm membranes and after co-incubation with oviducal cells in vitro, sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa were released more rapidly than non-sorted (control) frozen-thawed spermatozoa. The potentially reduced lifespan of sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa, and practical constraints on the number of spermatozoa that can be sorted for an insemination dose, makes insemination close to the site of fertilisation and time of ovulation critical for successful fertilisation. After treatment of ewes with GnRH to increase the precision of insemination in respect to the time of ovulation, there was no difference in pregnancy rate between ewes inseminated before, during or after the assumed time of ovulation. Furthermore, there was no difference in pregnancy rate after IU AI with similar doses of sorted frozen-thawed and non-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa in GnRH-treated ewes. The minimum dose of sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa required for commercially acceptable pregnancy rates determined after IU AI was high (20 x 106 motile).    Consequently, alternative methods for efficiently producing large numbers of offspring of a pre-determined sex using flow cytometrically sorted ram spermatozoa were investigated. Ram spermatozoa can be stored for short periods of time in a chilled state (liquid storage) or for an indefinite period of time in a frozen state (frozen storage; Salamon and Maxwell, 2000). The fixed location of the sperm sorter requires the need for transport of semen from the point of collection to the site of sorting and processing, but also from the sperm sorter site to the recipient females under artificial conditions. In this study, ram spermatozoa liquid stored for 24 h prior to sorting were efficiently sorted, frozen, thawed and after in vitro fertilisation and culture produced a high proportion of grade 1 blastocysts. Similarly, spermatozoa stored at reduced temperatures after sorting maintained high sperm quality for up to 6 days.     Furthermore, frozen-thawed spermatozoa from rams and some non-human primates were successfully prepared for sorting and efficiently sorted producing spermatozoa with high quality in vitro parameters. The quality of frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa after sorting was such that successful re-cryopreservation after sorting was possible. Low numbers of frozen-thawed sorted and re-frozen and thawed spermatozoa were optimal for IVF and a high proportion of grade 1 in vitro embryos of a pre-determined sex were produced. These embryos were either transferred immediately or vitrified prior to transfer, extending the application of the sperm sexing technology further. The birth of lambs of pre-determined sex after transfer of both fresh and vitrified embryos derived from frozen-thawed sorted spermatozoa was achieved.    The findings in this thesis suggest that sorted frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa may have more advanced membrane maturation state than non-sorted frozen-thawed spermatozoa, resulting in a decreased fertilizing lifespan in the female reproductive tract. Despite this, the use of sexed ram spermatozoa in a number of physiological states (fresh, liquid, frozen) with several different ARTs is possible in producing significant numbers of offspring of a pre-determined sex. Improved efficiency in both sperm sexing and associated reproductive technologies is required for commercialization to be achieved in the sheep industry.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sperm sexing;ram spermatozoa;artificial insemination;in vitro culture;embryo transfer</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Variable Stability Flight Simulation Facility    Re-engineering of Flight Control Loading and Motion Systems</field><field name="creator">Scamps, Alexander</field><field name="description">A Variable Stability Flight Simulator is being developed in the School of Aerospace, Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering at the University of Sydney, Australia. The device is being developed both as  a teaching tool for use in flight mechanics courses in the department and as a research tool. It is reasonable to state that learning is enhanced through the experience of concepts outside of the classroom environment. It is intended that the device will be integrated into the department&#65533;s teaching program in aircraft flight mechanics.    Initial studies centred around a PC based flight simulation developed at the Cranfield College of Aeronautics in the United Kingdom.  This system utilises a distributed architecture with several computers connected via Ethernet. It also employs a Primary Image three channel visual system.  The system has been further enhanced by the addition of a Link flight simulator provided by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). The RAAF had been using the simulator as a training tool for some years until it had become surplus to requirements.    Most of the work in the project has centred around re-engineering this simulator into a viable research/education tool. The Cranfield system has been incorporated into the Link simulator&#65533;s hardware to provide a fixed base simulation. The majority of the work described in this thesis revolved around the re-engineering of the flight control loading and motion systems. Previously these items were controlled by analogue circuitry with minimal digital interfaces to the main simulation software. The systems have been re-designed to replace much of the single model analogue circuitry with re-configurable digital control software. Doing so allows changes to be made to the systems in real time through a software interface. The software resides on a common computer that extensively interfaces with the rest of the simulation.    To support the hardware involved and to provide for system operation and safety, an extensive Supervisory system has also been implemented. This system along with the motion and control loading software has been implemented in the Matlab / Real-Time Workshop environment. This gives the capability of making real-time changes to any part of the overall simulation. A variable stability module (vsm) is under development. The addition of this module will allow changes to be made to the simulation itself in real-time.    The simulator is now functional with the motion and control loading systems operating as designed. Tuning of both systems has been done subjectively by the author. An initial objective analysis of the motion system has been undertaken in an attempt to verify the fidelity of the motion cues generated. A significant outcome of this project has been to create a safe, easily maintainable, re-configurable flight simulator from a large, complex, legacy system. The facility now forms a significant research and teaching tool in areas such as flight mechanics, propulsion, aircraft handling qualities and human factors.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flight simulator;variable stability simulator;re-configurable simulator</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SILENCE IN JAPANESE-AUSTRALIAN  CLASSROOM INTERACTION: PERCEPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE</field><field name="creator">Nakane, Ikuko</field><field name="description">This thesis examines silence as attributed to and performed by Japanese students in Australian university classrooms. It aims to elucidate processes in which silence can be used and created in intercultural communication in the classroom. The phenomenon of silence is approached from multiple perspectives. The data include interviews, a questionnaire and survey data, classroom observation and video-recorded classroom interactions. The data was collected in Australia and Japan. The Japanese data was included as part of sociocultural contexts where the Japanese students studying in Australia bring with them. The analysis draws on the frameworks of the ethnography of communication and conversation analysis. Micro- and macro- perspectives are combined to investigate how perceptions and performances interact to construct silence in the cross-cultural encounters in these classrooms. The thesis consists of four parts. The first part, Chapters 1-3, sets the theoretical background to the research. Chapter 1 describes how the research was conceived, and states the aims of the research. Chapter 2 reviews literature on silence, with specific attention to silence in Japanese communication and in classroom contexts. In Chapter 3 the methodological framework and design of this research is described. The second part, Chapter 4, examines how Japanese students&#65533; silence is perceived, both by themselves and their Australian teachers. The chapter is based on interviews with Japanese students in Australia, as well as findings from a questionnaire distributed to their lecturers. Japanese classroom practices as an aspect of the sociocultural background of Japanese students are also described.  Finally, the third part, Chapters 5, 6, 7, compares actual silence and performance in the classroom with perceived silence. There are three case studies which make up a substantial part of the thesis and provide detailed analyses of classroom interactions, based on video-recordings, observations, and follow-up interviews with key participants.

Fourier optics is used throughout the thesis as the underlying conceptual model, with a particular emphasis on three--dimensional Fourier optics.    A new challenge for optical modelling provided by digital microscopy is the relaxation of traditional symmetry constraints on optical design. An extension of optical transfer function theory to deal with arbitrary lens pupil functions is presented in this thesis. This is used to chart the 3D vectorial structure of the spatial frequency spectrum of the intensity in the focal region of a high aperture lens when illuminated by linearly polarised beam.    Wavefront coding has been used successfully in paraxial imaging systems to extend the depth of field. This is achieved by controlling the pupil phase with a cubic phase mask, and thereby balancing optical behaviour with digital processing.     In this thesis I present a high aperture vectorial model for focusing with a cubic phase mask, and compare it with results calculated using the paraxial approximation. The effect of a refractive index change is also explored. High aperture measurements of the point spread function are reported, along with experimental confirmation of high aperture extended depth of field imaging of a biological specimen.    Differential interference contrast is a popular method for imaging phase changes in otherwise transparent biological specimens. In this thesis I report on a new isotropic algorithm for retrieving the phase from differential interference contrast images of the phase gradient, using phase shifting, two directions of shear, and non--iterative Fourier phase integration incorporating a modified spiral phase transform. This method does not assume that the specimen has a constant amplitude. A simulation is presented which demonstrates good agreement between the retrieved phase and the phase of the simulated object, with excellent immunity to imaging noise.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microscope;biomedical imaging;Fourier optics;high aperture lens;vectorial optics;wavefront coding;depth of field;differential interference constrast;Nomarski;phase;optical transfer function</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex on the hustings: Labor and the construction of the woman vote in two federal elections (1983, 1993)</field><field name="creator">Huntley, Rebecca Jane</field><field name="description">The basic aim of this thesis is to describe and analyse how &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; was constructed within Labor discourse during the Hawke/Keating years.  My domain of investigation is electoral politics, in particular the federal election campaigns of 1983 and 1993.  These elections flank the beginning and the end of the Labor decade, a period of great significance to both the development of Labor politics specifically and Australian politics in general.  The elections of 1983 and 1993 were campaigns in which the Party made a concerted effort to attract women&#65533;s votes.  Through a reading of the various texts associated with these two campaigns, I explore the construction of &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; as a &#65533;new&#65533; political subject position within Labor discourse.      The dominant influences on the construction of &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; as a new subject position were Labor discourse and feminism, or more precisely Labor discourse affected by the incursion of feminism from the 1970s onwards.  This thesis describes and analyses how this subject position has been produced and reproduced within Labor discourse.  The gender gap research developed for the 1983 federal election constitutes one of the more important technologies that work to construct &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; within Labor discourse.  A reading of the texts associated with the 1983 campaign reveals the character of &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; as a caring figure.  However, as the Labor decade progressed, &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; is articulated in Labor discourse as a more complex figure, focused on her responsibilities both in the home and at paid work.  A reading of various texts associated with the 1993 election campaign shows that &#65533;the woman voter&#65533; is constructed as a carer-worker; this subject position is broadly consonant with the objectives liberal, economic government.  Certain modifications within this basic subject position can be observed in Labor&#65533;s anti-GST campaign materials, which made an appeal to the woman voter as consumer.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ALP;feminism;voting;federal elections</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal plasma immersion ion implantation and deposition using polymer substrates</field><field name="creator">Oates, T. W. H</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the application of plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) to polymers. PIII requires that a high negative potential be applied to the surface of the material while it is immersed in a plasma. This presents a problem for insulating materials such as polymers, since the implanting ions carry charge to the surface, resulting in a charge accumulation that effectively neutralises the applied potential. This causes the plasma sheath at the surface to collapse a short time after the potential is applied.     Measurements of the sheath dynamics, including the collapsing sheath, are performed using an electric probe. The results are compared to theoretical models of the plasma sheath based on the Child-Langmuir law for high voltage sheaths. The theoretical model predicts well the sheath dynamics for conductive substrates. For insulating substrates the model can account for the experimental observations if the secondary electron coefficient is modified, justified on the basis of the poly-energetic nature of the implanting ions.     If a conductive film is applied to the insulator surface the problem of charge accumulation can be avoided without compromising the effectiveness of PIII. The requirement for the film is that it be conductive, yet transparent to the incident ions. Experimental results are presented which confirm the effectiveness of the method. Theoretical estimates of the surface potential show that a film of the order of 5nm thickness can effectively circumvent the charge accumulation problem. Efforts to produce and characterise such a film form the final two chapters of this thesis. The optimal thickness is determined to be near the percolation threshold, where a marked increase in conductivity occurs. Spectroscopic ellipsometry is shown to be an excellent method to determine the film thickness and percolation threshold non-invasively.     Throughout this work cathodic vacuum arcs are used to deposit thin films and as a source of metal plasmas. The design and construction of a pulsed cathodic vacuum arc forms a significant part of this thesis. Investigations of the cathode spots and power supply requirements are presented.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PIII;Polymer surface modification;Plasma processing;Cathodic vacuum arc</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Industrial Welfarism in Australia 1890-1965</field><field name="creator">Balnave, Nikola Robyn</field><field name="description">This thesis examines industrial welfarism in Australia from 1890 to 1965. This period witnessed the gradual spread of the welfarism movement throughout Australian industry as employers sought ways to increase productivity and control in the face of external challenges. Once reaching its peak in the immediate post-War period, the welfarism movement was gradually subsumed as part of the increasing formalisation of personnel management. Waves of interest in welfare provision coincided with periods of labour shortage and/or labour militancy in Australia, indicating its dual role in the management of labour. Firstly, by offering benefits and services beyond that made necessary by the law or industrial awards, welfarism was designed to create a pool of good quality workers for management to draw from. Secondly, managers sought to enhance their control over these workers and their productive effort, using welfarism as a technique to build worker consent to managerial authority. This could be achieved through subtle methods aimed at boosting loyalty and morale, or through more direct programs designed to increase worker dependency on the company. In both ways, individual and collective worker resistance could be minimised, thereby reinforcing managerial prerogative. Despite its adoption by a variety of companies, a number of economic, political and institutional factors limited the extent of industrial welfarism in Australia. These include the small-scale of most enterprises prior to the Second World War, state involvement in the area of industrial relations and welfare provision, and the strength of organised labour. While the welfarism movement did not reach the heights experienced overseas, it nonetheless provided an important contribution to the development of formal labour management in Australia.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">industrial welfarism;welfarism;pension schemes;provident funds;company-sponsored recreation;company picnics;house journals;staff magazines;company libraries;health and accident schemes;safety first;in-house medical care;industrial nurses;company housing;company stores;superior amenities;canteens</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Five Years After Child Sexual Abuse</field><field name="creator">Swanston, Heather Yvette</field><field name="description">Introduction  Child sexual abuse is a common problem.  Psychological and behavioural problems in children and adults who have experienced child sexual abuse have been associated with the abuse.  Little research has been conducted which has been long-term, prospective, involved substantiated sexual abuse, included a control group, took into account mediating factors, utilised multiple data sources, relied on standardised measures and had a high follow-up rate.    Aim  The aims of this study were to compare a cohort of sexually abused young people with a group of nonabused peers and to establish predictors of psychological and behavioural outcome.    Method  This study was a follow-up which was long-term, prospective, involved a sample of children with substantiated sexual abuse, included a control group, took into account mediating factors, utilised multiple data sources, relied on standardised measures and had a high follow-up rate.    Eighty-four sexually abused young people were followed up five years after presenting to Children&#65533;s Hospitals&#65533; Child Protection Units for sexual abuse and were compared to a group of 84 nonabused young people of similar age and sex.  The two groups were compared on the basis of demographic variables, family functioning, mother&#65533;s mental health and life events; the outcome measures of depression, self-esteem, anxiety, behaviour, criminal activity, alcohol and other drug use, eating problems, running away, suicide attempts, self-injury, hopefulness, despair and attributional style; and potential mediating factors such as further notifications to the Department of Community Services, receipt of psychological treatment, legal action against offenders and victims compensation.  Potential predictors of outcome were (1) demographic variables, (2) sexual abuse characteristcs, (3) intake data and (4) five year follow-up variables.    Main findings  Follow-up rates were 81percent (n equals 68) for cases and 89percent (n equals 75) for controls.  Five years after presenting for the sexual abuse, the sexually abused young people were performing more poorly than their nonabused peers on various measures of psychological state and behaviour.  Although the abused children had experienced more negative life events (p&lt;.001), were from lower socio-economic groups (p&lt;.0001), had more changes in parent figures (p&lt;.001) and had mothers who were more psychologically distressed (p equals .03), multiple regression analysis showed that after allowing for these and other demographic and family factors, there were still significant differences between the groups after the 5 years. The abused children displayed more disturbed behavior (p equals .002), had lower self-esteem (p&lt;.001), were more depressed or unhappy (p&lt;.001) and were more anxious (p equals .03) than controls.  Sexually abused children had significantly higher levels of bingeing (p equals .02), self-injury (p equals.009) and suicide attempts (p equals .03).    Significant predictors of psychological and behavioural outcome were significantly related to family and parent functioning variables.  Abuse status was not a significant predictor when offered to each of the predictive models.  Significant predictors of outcome included the following intake variables: family functioning, mother&#65533;s mental health, whether parents were employed or not, behaviour scores, prior notifications for neglect, history of parental discord and whether there were caregiver changes or not prior to intake.  The classification of the index sexual abuse event as indecent assault and whether there were notifications for sexual abuse prior to the index event also significantly predicted outcome.  Five year follow-up variables which were significant predictors of outcome were the young person&#65533;s age, number of negative life events, attributional style, self-esteem, depression, number of parent changes, anxiety, despair, whether there were notifications for abuse/neglect after intake and having a parent with a history of drug/alcohol problems.    Conclusions  Difficulties associated with child sexual abuse continue for some years after the abuse event.  Child sexual abuse needs to be considered as a possible antecedent of behaviour and psychological difficulties in young people.  Treatment and monitoring should continue for some years after the abuse.  Treatment may need to be directed more towards young people&#65533;s psychological states rather than focusing specifically on the sexual abuse.  Family and parent functioning may need to be addressed early in order to prevent some of the behavioural and psychological difficulties associated with the long-term outcome of child sexual abuse.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child sexual abuse;depression;self esteem;anxiety;despair;helplessness;eating disorder;revictimisation;behaviour;crime;drug use;running away;suicide;self injury;attributional style;compensation;treatment;mental health;family functioning;life events</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/573</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regional Labour Councils and Local Government Employment Generation: The South Coast Labour Council 1981-1996</field><field name="creator">Rittau, Yasmin</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the role of regional labour councils in local employment  generation. It specifically analyses the case of an Australian regional labour council, the  South Coast Labour Council (SCLC), between 1981 and 1996. The Illawarra region was  the centre of SCLC activity. It was an industrialised region that experienced high levels  of unemployment in the period. These were greater than the State and national  averages, which reflected a geographical concentration of unemployment in certain  regions in Australia. The SCLC attempted to address this issue, as it was part of the  union structure that was specifically focused on the regional level and on regional  concerns.  The study argues that the SCLC developed a local employment generation strategy and  it examines how and why this was adopted and pursued. It finds that the SCLC was  well placed at the regional level and was well resourced with a capacity to influence  the external environment through its utilisation of both political and industrial  methods in a period of agreeable internal relations. The research identifies the  development of its local employment generation strategy. Sometimes the SCLC pursued  its strategy in a manner of ad hoc decision-making and muddling through, while at  other times it involved characteristic and distinctive regular patterns. The thesis  concludes by evaluating the SCLC&#65533;s strategy of local employment generation and by  exploring the applicability of the general trade union literature on methods and strategy  to regional labour councils.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">peak union council;trades council;union agency;political lobbying;industrial negotiation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sex, subjectivity and agency: A life history study of women's sexual relations and practices with men</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Joanne</field><field name="description">This study explores women&#8217;s experiences of sex with men. It is based on qualitative data collected from eighteen life history interviews. Such an approach provides means for examining women&#8217;s sexual experiences over time. The study finds that women give meaning to their sexual experiences through two main discursive representations: the passive, &#8220;proper&#8221; and sexually obliging girlfriend or wife, and the active and &#8220;sexually equal&#8221; woman. However, these representations do not capture the entirety of women&#8217;s sexual experiences. The life history analysis demonstrates that women are not simply inscribed by discourse. Rather, they are embodied beings actively engaged in pursuing sexual identities. Central to the process is a relationship between the practice of sex and self-reflexivity over time. Finally, the study demonstrates how the process of gaining sexual subjectivity is shaped by the material conditions of women&#8217;s lives. For instance, the praxeological circumstances of women&#8217;s class or race are powerful in recasting discourses of feminine sexuality, the meanings women ascribe to them, their access to broader sexual experiences, and the kinds of relationships they have with their male partners.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subjectivity;sexuality;femininity;embodiment;life history</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Hearing with Simultaneous Sound Sources:  A Psychophysical Investigation</field><field name="creator">Best, Virginia Ann</field><field name="description">This thesis provides an overview of work conducted to investigate human spatial hearing in situations involving multiple concurrent sound sources. Much is known about spatial hearing with single sound sources, including the acoustic cues to source location and the accuracy of localisation under different conditions. However, more recently interest has grown in the behaviour of listeners in more complex environments. Concurrent sound sources pose a particularly difficult problem for the auditory system, as their identities and locations must be extracted from a common set of sensory receptors and shared computational machinery. It is clear that humans have a rich perception of their auditory world, but just how concurrent sounds are processed, and how accurately, are issues that are poorly understood. This work attempts to fill a gap in our understanding by systematically examining spatial resolution with multiple sound sources.  A series of psychophysical experiments was conducted on listeners with normal hearing to measure performance in spatial localisation and discrimination tasks involving more than one source. The general approach was to present sources that overlapped in both frequency and time in order to observe performance in the most challenging of situations. Furthermore, the role of two primary sets of location cues in concurrent source listening was probed by examining performance in different spatial dimensions. The binaural cues arise due to the separation of the two ears, and provide information about the lateral position of sound sources. The spectral cues result from location-dependent filtering by the head and pinnae, and allow vertical and front-rear auditory discrimination. Two sets of experiments are described that employed relatively simple broadband noise stimuli. In the first of these, two-point discrimination thresholds were measured using simultaneous noise bursts. It was found that the pair could be resolved only if a binaural difference was present; spectral cues did not appear to be sufficient. In the second set of experiments, the two stimuli were made distinguishable on the basis of their temporal envelopes, and the localisation of a designated target source was directly examined. Remarkably robust localisation was observed, despite the simultaneous masker, and both binaural and spectral cues appeared to be of use in this case. Small but persistent errors were observed, which in the lateral dimension represented a systematic shift away from the location of the masker. The errors can be explained by interference in the processing of the different location cues. Overall these experiments demonstrated that the spatial perception of concurrent sound sources is highly dependent on stimulus characteristics and configurations. This suggests that the underlying spatial representations are limited by the accuracy with which acoustic spatial cues can be extracted from a mixed signal. Three sets of experiments are then described that examined spatial performance with speech, a complex natural sound. The first measured how well speech is localised in isolation. This work demonstrated that speech contains high-frequency energy that is essential for accurate three-dimensional localisation. In the second set of experiments, spatial resolution for concurrent monosyllabic words was examined using similar approaches to those used for the concurrent noise experiments. It was found that resolution for concurrent speech stimuli was similar to resolution for concurrent noise stimuli. Importantly, listeners were limited in their ability to concurrently process the location-dependent spectral cues associated with two brief speech sources. In the final set of experiments, the role of spatial hearing was examined in a more relevant setting containing concurrent streams of sentence speech. It has long been known that binaural differences can aid segregation and enhance selective attention in such situations. The results presented here confirmed this finding and extended it to show that the spectral cues associated with different locations can also contribute.  As a whole, this work provides an in-depth examination of spatial performance in concurrent source situations and delineates some of the limitations of this process. In general, spatial accuracy with concurrent sources is poorer than with single sound sources, as both binaural and spectral cues are subject to interference. Nonetheless, binaural cues are quite robust for representing concurrent source locations, and spectral cues can enhance spatial listening in many situations. The findings also highlight the intricate relationship that exists between spatial hearing, auditory object processing, and the allocation of attention in complex environments.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial Hearing;Simultaneous Sound Sources;Psychophysical Investigation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pension reform: an analysis of the economic foundations of private pensions</field><field name="creator">Vidler, Sacha</field><field name="description">The dissertation investigates support by economists for the global policy shift away from unfunded public pension schemes towards funded private pension schemes.  Influential economists and institutions, including the World Bank, present a suite of economic arguments that suggest that this shift will have positive effects on national economies, particularly in the context of aging.       The arguments may be categorised according to their relation to the operation of three sets of institutions: capital markets, labour markets and political systems.      In capital markets, the transition is purported to increase private and national saving, increase the quantity and quality of investment, and provide more efficient private administration.  In labour markets, it is claimed that the shift will reduce labour market distortions associated with public pensions, which inhibit competitiveness, produce unemployment and encourage early retirement.  According to the World Bank, public pensions systems cause these distortions without achieving their stated objective of reducing inequality.  In the political sphere, the shift is purported to insulate the pension system from political pressures, which otherwise inevitably lead to crisis.     The thesis provides evidence which refutes these claims.  The best research, including studies by orthodox economists, indicate that the shift does not increase savings or investment, or improve the quality of financial investment.  The main effect of tax concessions associated with private pension systems is to divert to private pension funds savings that would occur in any case via other mechanisms.  The tax concessions are also regressive, even in systems with compulsory elements.  Private administration of pensions, particularly in a plural consumer market setting, is highly inefficient, with customers at a disadvantage in dealing with providers due to the complexity and opacity of products and pricing.     A negative relationship is found between public pension spending and levels of elderly poverty, suggesting that reducing public pension spending increases levels of elderly inequality.  Public pensions are found not to explain differences in economic growth between regions.  Elements of system design which distort labour markets, such as by encouraging early retirement, can easily be adjusted.  However, such elements are explicit government policy in several countries.     A review of public and private pensions finds that examples of public system crisis are associated with instances of economic and political collapse, rather than system design.  Private funded systems are found to be more vulnerable, not less, to the same external influences.  Relatively generous universal public pension systems are found to be financially sustainable despite demographic change, assuming modest levels of economic growth.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pension reform; welfare; world bank</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Urban design and the better cities program: the influence of urban design on the outcomes of the program.</field><field name="creator">Gerner, Robert Pemberton</field><field name="description">The aims of the research were to assess the influence of urban design on the Better Cities Program (BCP) and to explore and document the achievements of the Program in terms of urban design. This in turn led to the exploration of some 34 case studies of the BCP initiatives known as Area Strategies throughout Australia. The research outcomes provided an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Program&#65533;s objectives and processes in relation to urban design and prompted suggested options or modifications, which could enhance outcomes in future initiatives. The thesis is an overview of the Program&#65533;s genesis and procedures, including comment on economic, political and social concerns, and draws from this broad analysis the specific issues and outcomes related to urban design practice. It was perceived that whilst not centrally an urban design program the BCP fell short of known urban design principles that could reasonably be expected to be present, given that the achievement of better cities is dependent in large part on better urban design. To maintain a comprehensive overview and sense of continuity the research included urban design evaluations of two projects from the earlier Department of Urban and Regional Development (DURD) period. This was done in order to review the state of urban design at that time and to discover whether fresh insights and approaches may have occurred over the intervening 25 years. To structure the research, a number of interlinking methods were implemented. These included literature reviews, interviews, questionnaires and case studies of the Program&#65533;s projects - called Area Strategies - and their ranking through a matrix. Methods extended to a comparative analysis of the Program&#65533;s objectives with those of DURD. The Area Strategies were interrogated from three positions, namely: by evaluation of these initiatives based on an Empirical approach; by critical literature where available, but mostly from a more abundant source of descriptive literature and by expert opinion through many interviews, discussions and the Questionnaire responses. The methods were essential in order to collate, analyse and categorise the gathered information for the purpose of evaluation, summarising and framing of conclusions. Central to the thesis was the reliance on the &#65533;enduring strands&#65533;, being those essential and timehonoured fundamental elements of the urban fabric. These enduring strands became the evaluation tools of the case studies, and comprised the following: buildings and their groupings, the public domain, issues of safety and security, activities, conservation and heritage, the role of landscape, architectural responses to the environment, ecological responses, circulation, public art, social responses and management processes. The discipline of urban design as distinct from city planning and architecture, developed signifi- cantly during the second half of the twentieth century and it received Commonwealth recognition during the life of the Program through the publication of the findings of Prime Minister Keating&#65533;s Urban Design Task Force. The thesis compares the recommendations of the Task Force and those of the research and finds sufficient parallels to affirm that both endeavours share a common basis. It is not the role of the thesis to recommend an urban design policy for potential future programs, but it does point to the way urban design might be better integrated in such programs. This research provides support for the argument that if urban design concerns had occupied a more central position in the range of objectives of the Better Cities Program, then the outcomes would have been more satisfactory in many of the projects. With greater recognition of the critical contribution of urban design skills, outcomes of future programs of this nature could potentially be significantly enhanced.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban design;better cities program</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Recruitment of Children to Randomised Controlled Trials</field><field name="creator">Caldwell, Patrina Ha Yuen</field><field name="description">Abstract    Background  The randomised-controlled trial (RCT) provides the best evidence for evaluating treatment effects and is accepted as a gold standard for clinical and regulatory decision making (1;2). One of the major challenges to the conduct of RCTs is the recruitment of adequate numbers of participants. Inadequate numbers reduce the power of a study to detect statistically significant treatment effects, and may cause delays, increased costs and failure to complete trials.     The need for clinical trials in children has been increasingly recognised by the scientific community, resulting in increased demands for the inclusion of children in trials. For several reasons, recruiting children to trials is more challenging than recruiting adults, as consent issues are more difficult because parents make decisions about trial participation on behalf of their child. Despite general professional and community support for paediatric clinical trials, parents and paediatricians express reluctance when their own child or patient is asked to participate. Although researchers working with children commonly experience difficulty with recruiting children to RCTs, little is known about this very important subject.    The method by which potential participants are approached for trial participation, the influence of their health care provider and the attitude of potential participants (or their parents, in the case of children), are critical to the understanding of the decision making process for trial participation. This thesis is one of the first major attempts to explore the issues surrounding the recruitment of children to RCTs, and is divided into four studies which address these issues.    Methods  Recruitment strategies used to encourage participation in randomised controlled trials (systematic review)   Eligible experimental and observational studies comparing methods of recruiting participants for RCTs were identified after a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and reference lists. Independent data extractions were completed by two reviewers who assessed the studies for eligibility and methodological quality. Outcome measures were consent rates, proportion enrolled by each method and cost of recruitment per participant. Summary estimators of effects were calculated using a random effects model and expressed as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was analysed using the Q statistic.    Paediatricians&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)   Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions involving 16 paediatricians and 5 trainees from a paediatric teaching hospital in Sydney was undertaken. Doctors varied in occupation, experience, research activity, age, gender, ethnicity and parenthood experience. A professional facilitator conducted the semi-structured group discussions. Recruitment ceased when informational redundancy was reached, after 4 focus groups involving 21 participants. The transcribed audiotapes were analysed by theme linkage using the constant comparative method.    Australian paediatricians&#65533; and adult physicians&#65533; attitudes to randomised controlled trials (survey)  A 44-item questionnaire was sent to 250 paediatricians and 250 adult physicians randomly selected from the membership list of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Questions assessing doctors&#65533; treatment philosophies and attitudes to trials were compared with demographic and practice variables.    Parents&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)  Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions involving 33 parents from 5 different settings (representing parents of children with a life threatening, chronic or acute illness, with experience in trials and of healthy children) was undertaken. Parents varied in age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, research experience and their child&#65533;s health status. The transcribed discussions were analysed by theme linkage using the constant comparative method.    Results  Recruitment strategies used to encourage participation in randomised controlled trials (systematic review)   Fifty papers were included (out of 8602 titles and abstracts searched) which described 8 RCTs, 2 quasi RCTs, 13 prospective cohort studies, 30 retrospective cohort studies and 2 before-after studies.  These studies assessed how over 4 million people were approached for RCT participation using 87 different recruitment strategies, with 103,406 people enrolling in RCTs. Health care provider (HCP) referrals had the highest participant consent rates at the time of exposure to trial information (HCP referral versus target mailing: relative risk (RR) 1.84 (95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.08, 3.13)). They also had the highest consent rates when potential participants respond to the recruitment material by further enquiry about the trial (HCP referral versus community presentation: RR 1.37 (1.06; 1.78); HCP referral versus worksite approach: RR 25.20 (20.19, 31.45); HCP referral versus general community approach: RR 2.53 (0.46, 14.05); HCP referral versus mailing: RR 3.29 (1.26, 8.60); HCP referral versus media: RR 2.66 (1.31, 5.41)). However, by the time potential participants attend eligibility assessment for trial participation, no difference in consent rates could be distinguished by method of recruitment. Higher proportions of study participants were recruited by methods that exposed larger numbers of potential candidates to trial information (despite their lower consent rates). The stated recruitment cost ranged from US$0 to $1108 per participant, with mailing being the most cost-effective method and community methods (such as community presentations, pamphlets and posters displayed at community sites) the least effective.     Paediatricians&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)   From the focus group discussions, paediatricians thought parents balanced perceived gains and risks when deciding about trial participation. They also believed the child&#65533;s condition and parents&#65533; health beliefs and personal attributes influenced parents&#65533; decisions. Other factors thought to be important by paediatricians were the doctors&#65533; beliefs and their relationship with the investigators. Paediatricians perceived gains for trial participation including professional benefits for themselves, improved patient care, convenience for the families and themselves and scientific advancement. Perceived risks included inconvenience, inadequate resources and potential harms to the patient and the doctor-patient relationship. Paediatricians with previous research experience were most knowledgeable about RCTs and perceived greatest gains from trial participation. Paediatricians&#65533; personal treatment preferences hindered trial support.     Australian paediatricians&#65533; and adult physicians&#65533; attitudes to randomised controlled trials (survey)  Response rate from the paediatricians&#65533; and adult physicians&#65533; survey was 60% (300/500). Australian paediatricians and adult physicians are very similar in their treatment philosophies, and are clinician-oriented rather than research-oriented in their attitudes, with primary allegiance to their patients and preference for selecting treatment rather than referring for trial participation in the face of treatment uncertainty.  Professional activities are clinically focused, with limited time assigned for research.  Australian doctors perceive little reward for trial participation and claim that the opinions of referring doctors regarding RCTs does not influence them.    Predictors of favourable attitudes to trial participation from the survey were time allocation for research, a history of referring patients to trials in the past and younger age (all p values less than 0.0001).   Parents&#65533; attitudes to children&#65533;s participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research)  When parents were interviewed, they acknowledged balancing risks and benefits when deciding about trial participation for their child. Perceived benefits include the offer of hope, better care of their child, the opportunity to access new treatments, healthcare professionals and health information, meeting others in similar circumstances and helping others. Perceived risks include potential side effects, being randomised to ineffective treatments and the inconvenience of participation. The decision for trial participation is also influenced by parental factors (parents&#65533; knowledge, beliefs and emotional response), child factors (the child&#65533;s health status and preference about participation), trial factors (the use of placebos and the uncertainties of research) and doctor factors (doctor&#65533;s recommendations and communication of trial information).    Conclusions  There are many challenges to the successful conduct of RCTs. Ways of addressing these include: using effective methods of recruiting potential study participants (such as mailing of recruitment material to potential participants) and abandoning ineffective strategies (such as community methods): fostering greater willingness for trial participation by addressing parents&#65533; and paediatricians&#65533; concerns including enhancing communication between researchers, paediatricians and parents, and improving the gains-hazard balance (by increasing incentives while decreasing inconveniences); and reforming in the health care system to raise the priority placed on clinical research by restructuring clinical research in a clinically predominant workplace and with a clinically predominant workforce.    The findings from this study have implications for researchers planning RCTs for children in the future. Careful consideration of the above will enhance RCTs participation for children improving efficiency, lowering costs and ultimately improving the future health care of children.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children;paediatric;recruitment;trial;randomised controlled trials;research</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Service Delivery Management: A Process for Proactively Ensuring Customer Satisfaction.</field><field name="creator">Schoen, Andre</field><field name="description">SDM is a process model, based on service marketing components, to position a service while concurrently being a service delivery management tool improving serviceen counter processes. Added to a service script, SDM can increase customer satisfaction, quality perception, voice levels and repurchase intentions in a general service encounter scenario as well as during episodes which include a failure. Addressing mishaps requires particular attention, since Consumer Complaint Behaviour research shows that most customers prefer to switch suppliers, rather than offer constructive feedback. This means that many service failures go unnoticed, with a large proportion of customers defecting. Since most services are performed in real time by service personnel, consistent quality output is a  challenge. Therefore, occasional service failures are inevitable. Present research recognises this by offering suggestions, but does not present an integrated framework like SDM, using the presence of a customer during a service encounter as an unique opportunity to resolve issues on the spot. An elicitation process is used as a first step, attempting to improve voice and minimising lost feedback. Step two is a specific service recovery process, adapted to the failure type. SDM processes can also lead to a general increase of satisfaction and quality perception, regardless of whether or not there was a service failure. With satisfaction generally being regarded as an actual repurchase behaviour indicator, this may lead to increased sales turnover, while a higher quality perception may lead to a larger price premium tolerance and therefore higher profits. Higher service quality perceptions can also be used as a marketing positioning tool to differentiate a service from competitors. Data collected supported all hypotheses put forward in this thesis, showing statistically significant improvements on all key variables, including a satisfaction rating increase of 24percent when SDM was applied. In academic terms, the process model tested did not only link separate literature streams, but offered an integrated, proactive tool which is capable of operating in real time. Traditionally, academic models and their processes analyse results after an episode concludes, while SDM allows a provider to positively influence or manage satisfaction levels during the service delivery.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service delivery;management;marketing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MODELLING OF SOLAR KILNS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOPTIMISED SCHEDULE FOR DRYING HARDWOOD TIMBER</field><field name="creator">Haque, M. Nawshadul</field><field name="description">This research examines the drying of hardwood timber with particular reference to seasoning blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in a solar kiln. The aims of this research were to develop an optimised drying schedule for drying blackbutt and to develop and validate a mathematical model for a solar kiln.  In the first stage of this study, the cross-grain physical and mechanical properties were determined for blackbutt timber so that an optimised schedule (based on drying within a limiting strain envelope) can be developed using model predictive control techniques for drying 43 mm thick (green) blackbutt timber boards in solar kilns. This optimised schedule has been developed and tested in the laboratory. The drying time was 10% shorter for this schedule than the original schedule, compared with an expected reduction in drying time of 14% (relative to the original schedule). Overall the quality was slightly better and the drying time was shorter for the optimised schedule compared with the original schedule.  A complete solar kiln model has been developed and validated based on comparisons between the predicted and the measured internal air temperatures, relative humidities and timber moisture contents. The maximum difference between the actual and predicted moisture contents was 0.05 kg kg-1. The agreement between the predicted and measured temperatures of the internal air is reasonable, and both the predictions and measurements have a similar cyclical pattern. The generally good agreement between the model prediction of the final moisture content and its measurement may be due to the careful measurement of the boundary conditions such as the solar energy input.  The key uncertainties were identified as the heat exchanger output, the measurement of the initial moisture content, the amount of accumulation of condensate on the floor, and the estimation of sky temperature. The significant uncertainty (18%) in the estimation of the initial moisture content is a key reason for the mismatch between the model prediction and the measurements. In terms of operating variables, the energy release rate from the heat exchanger had the greatest effect on the simulated performance, followed by the water spray and venting rates. The simulation suggested that a material with a lower transmissivity to thermal radiation may effectively lower radiation losses, improving the kiln performance, so such materials for glazing is a high priority.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MODELLING;SOLAR KILNS;ANOPTIMISED SCHEDULE;DRYING HARDWOOD TIMBER</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of Some Linear and Nonlinear Time Series Models</field><field name="creator">Ainkaran, Ponnuthurai</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis considers some linear and nonlinear time series models. In the linear case, the analysis of a large number of short time series generated by a first order autoregressive type model is considered. The conditional and exact maximum likelihood procedures are developed to estimate parameters. Simulation results are presented and compare the bias and the mean square errors of the parameter estimates. In Chapter 3, five important nonlinear models are considered and their time series properties are discussed. The estimating function approach for nonlinear models is developed in detail in Chapter 4 and examples are added to illustrate the theory.

The current literature indicates that KS is initiated by the  human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) as a reactive polyclonal process but with  deregulation of oncogene and tumour suppressor genes, it can progress to a  true malignancy with monoclonality. Clinically, classical KS often presents as  an indolent disease affecting mainly the lower extremities whereas AIDS-related  KS has no site predilection and can progress rapidly with systemic involvement.  Histologically, KS can be classified into patch, plaque and nodular stages.  Interestingly, classical and AIDS-related KS are indistinguishable histologically  and this suggests that AIDS-related KS and classical KS might be initiated by a  common aetiology but given their different clinical courses, they may progress  through different mechanisms. In view of the importance of the cell cycle  proteins in the development and progression of many human malignancies, this  thesis aims to examine the role of these proteins in the progression of the two  main clinical subtypes of KS.  The cell cycle protein expressions in a cohort of 47 patients with KS with welldocumented  clinical and histological features were studied. Using a monclonal  antibody against the latent nuclear antigen-1 molecule of HHV8, HHV8 was  detected in 78% of the cases. The more advanced nodular lesions were found  to have a higher level of proliferative activity as measured by the proliferation  x  marker, Ki-67. This suggests it is valid to use the histological specimens as a  tumour progression model of KS.  The role of the Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway was examined. The more advanced  nodular stage KS lesions were more likely to be positive for cyclin D1,  suggesting that cyclin D1 is important in the progression from patch stage to  nodular stage. p16 acts as a tumour suppressor and it has an inhibitory effect  on cyclin D1. The p16 expression rate was low in early stage KS but high in the  more advanced lesions. It seems that reduced p16 expression occurs early in  KS and may be important in its development. The rate of Rb expression, on the  other hand, did not differ significantly among the histological subtypes. The  results revealed the significant role of the Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway in the  progression of KS.  Of the mitotic cyclins examined, cyclin A expression was correlated with the  advanced tumor stage. The rate of p34cdc2 expression was high in the lesions  and there was no correlation with histological stage. This suggests that p34cdc2  is important in the early development of the tumour but not necessarily in its  progression.  Along the p53-apoptotic pathway, mutant p53 expression was significantly more  common in the nodular stage. The cyclin G1 (a protooncogene, one of the  target genes of p53) expression also paralleled that of mutant p53 with the  majority of the KS lesions showing cyclin G1 expression and significant  xi  correlation between advanced histological stage and increasing rate of cyclin  G1 expression. These findings suggest that progression along the p53 pathway  may be important in the advanced stage development of KS. On the other  hand, expression of the CDK inhibitor, p27, a protein that normally negatively  regulates cyclin G1, was reduced in nodular KS. These findings suggest that  some KS lesions may progress through a deregulated or abnormal p53  pathway.  There were correlations between cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin G1, mutant p53 and  negative HIV status. The findings suggest that components of both the  Rb/cyclin D1/p16 and p53-apoptotic pathways are important in the progression  of classical KS.  Rb protein was the only cell cycle protein whose rate of expression correlated  significantly with HHV8 status in KS. The majority of HHV8 positive lesions  were also positive for Rb protein, unlike HHV8 negative lesions. This suggests  that some of the HHV8 negative lesions can progress through a defective Rb  pathway whereas the role of Rb in the progression may not be as important in  the HHV8 positive lesions. This was an unexpected finding given that one of  the postulated mechanisms of tumour initiation by the HHV8 virus is via the viral  cyclin it produces. The viral cyclin produced by HHV8 acts through the Rb  pathway much the same as cyclin D1 and one would have expected that HHV8  positive cases are less likely to be positive for the Rb protein.  In summary, the majority of the KS lesions examined in this thesis show HHV8  infection. The Rb/cyclin D1/p16 pathway appears to be important in the  progression of the different stages of KS and expression of the proteins  involved in the p53 pathway were found to be important in the advanced stages  of the development of KS. There were differential expressions of cell cycle  proteins between AIDS-related and classical KS, and between HHV8 positive  and HHV8 negative lesions. The findings also provided some clues to the  possible mechanisms of development in KS lesions that were not initiated by  HHV8.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kaposi's sarcoma;cell cycle protein;AIDS;Herpes virus 8;p53</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/583</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognitive behavioural models of chronic pain and the role of selective attention</field><field name="creator">Dehghani, Mohsen</field><field name="description">Cognitive-behavioural based models of chronic pain contend that appraisals of harm affect the individual&#65533;s response to pain. It has been suggested that fear of pain and/or anxiety sensitivity predispose individuals to chronicity. However, other factors such as pain self-efficacy are believed to mediate between experience of pain and disability. According to this view, pain is maintained through hypervigilance towards painful sensations and subsequent avoidance. Four studies were conducted in order to evaluate the structure of fear-avoidance models of chronic pain, and also, to examine the role of hypervigilance as an underlying mechanism in maintenance of pain.   In study one, using a sample of 207 consecutive patients, two models were tested. First, fear of movement model as proposed by Vlaeyen et al. (1995a) was examined. It was found that negative affectivity has direct effects on the fear and avoidance of pain, which in turn, contributes to disability. In total, fear/avoidance accounted for a significant amount of the variance of disability. In addition, severity of pain was found to increase pain disability, while itself is influenced still by negative affectivity. These findings supported the model of fear of pain as described by Vlaeyen et al. (1995a). Further, we found that self-efficacy may mediate the impact of fear of pain on disability and reduces the perceived physical disability. At the same time, self-efficacy was shown to have direct reductive impact on disability. However, both studies indicated that people who are fearful in response to pain are more likely to develop disability, although self-efficacy may play a moderating role. In the studies one, two, and three, the role of hypervigilance in over attending to pain was investigated. In study one a large sample of 168 chronic pain patients were studied. Questionnaires measuring different aspects of pain and a computerised version of the Dot-Probe Task were administered. Four types of words related to different dimensions of pain and matched neutral words were used as stimuli. Reaction times in response to the stimuli were recorded. A factorial design 3x4x2x2 and ANOVAs were employed to analyse the data.   Chronic pain patients showed a cognitive bias to sensory pain words relative to affective, disability, and threat-related words. However, contrary to expectations, those high in fear of pain responded more slowly to stimuli than those less fearful of pain.  These results suggest that patients with chronic pain problems selectively attend to sensory aspects of pain. However, selective attention appears to depend upon the nature of pain stimuli. For those who are highly fearful of pain they may not only selectively attend to pain-related information but also have difficulty disengaging from those stimuli.  In study two, 35 chronic pain patients were compared with the same number matched healthy subjects. Both groups completed measures of fear of pain, anxiety sensitivity, depression and anxiety, in addition to dot probe task. Results indicated that both groups show similar attentional bias to sensory words in comparison with other word types. However, the level of this biasness was higher for chronic pain patients. Lack of significant differences between patients and controls is discussed in the context of possible evolutionary value of sensitivity to pain as an adaptive reaction in healthy controls, and contrary, as a maladaptive response to pain in chronic pain patients.   The results of the previous research suggest that chronic pain patients demonstrate cognitive biases towards pain-related information and that such biases predict patient functioning. The forth study examined the degree to which a successful cognitive-behavioural program was able to modify the observed attentional bias towards sensory pain words. Forty-two patients with chronic pain conditions for more than three months were recruited prior to commencing a cognitive-behavioural pain management program. Participants were assessed before the program, after the program and at one-month follow-up. Results confirmed that chronic pain patients exhibited biased attention towards sensory pain-related words at pre-treatment. These biases were still evident at post-treatment, but were no longer statistically significant at follow up. Multiple regression analyses indicated that the changes in attentional bias towards sensory words between post-treatment and follow-up were predicted by pre- to post- treatment changes in fear of movement (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia) but not other relevant variables, such as fear of pain or anxiety sensitivity. These results demonstrate that successful cognitive-behavioural treatments can reduce selective attention, thought to be indicative of hypervigilance towards pain. Moreover, these biases appear to be changed by reducing the fear associated with movement. Theoretically, these results provide support for the fear of (re)injury model of pain. Clinically, this study supports the contention that fear of (re)injury and movement is an appropriate target of pain management and that reducing these fears causes patients to attend less to pain-related stimuli.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chronic pain;selective attention;fear of pain;structural models</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/584</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteomic Investigation of the HIV Receptors CD4 and DC-Sign/CD209</field><field name="creator">Bernhard, Oliver Karl</field><field name="description">HIV infection and disease is a multistage process that involves a variety of cell types as the virus spreads through the body. Initially, dendritic cells (DCs) present at the mucosal site of infection bind and internalise HIV for degradation and presentation to T cells. As the DCs migrate to lymph nodes and mature, part of the internalised virions remains infective inside endosomal compartments. During formation of the immunological synapse between CD4 T cells and DCs, infective virions from dendritic cells are transferred to CD4 T cells leading to a strong infection of those cells allowing rapid virus dissemination throughout the body and establishment of the typical HIV infection. Various membrane receptors are involved in this process. Initial HIV binding to DCs is mediated by C-type lectin receptors such as the mannose receptor or DC-SIGN (DC specific intracellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non integrin) which is followed by virus internalisation and lysis albeit virus induced changes in endocytic routing prevents a proportion from degradation. Productive infection of DCs has also been observed allowing trans infection of CD4 T cells through a different mechanism. HIV infection of CD4 T cells, DCs and other cells is a multistep process initiated by binding of HIV envelope gp120 to the CD4 receptor, a 55 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. Subsequent conformational changes in gp120 allow binding to a chemokine receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4, followed by membrane fusion and infection. The aim of this thesis was to investigate protein associations with the HIV receptors DC-SIGN and CD4 in order to elucidate the mechanism of complex formation, virus entry and/or defining target sites for antiretroviral drugs. This thesis used a proteomic approach for studying the receptors with mass spectrometry-based protein identification as its core technology. A range of different approaches were developed and compared for identification of protein interactions and characterisation of the identified protein associations. An affinity purification of the CD4 receptor complex from lymphoid cells was used as the basis for detecting novel CD4-binding proteins. For this approach a strategy based on mass spectrometry identification of CD4 associating proteins using affinity chromatography and affinity-tag mediated purification of tryptic peptides was developed. This method proved successful for the identification of CD4 interacting proteins such as the strongly associated kinase p56lck, however a limited number of non-specifically bound proteins were also identified along the receptor complex. Using one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by in-gel digests and mass spectrometry analysis, a large number of non-specifically binding proteins were identified along the CD4/lck complex. Evaluation of different lysis buffers in several independent experiments demonstrated that there was a large and inconsistent array of proteins that were obviously non-specifically bound to the receptor. No further specific binding partners were detected. These data suggested that protein interactions of CD4 on this cell type are of weak and/or transient nature. It also demonstrated a need for careful interpretation of proteomic data in the light of the propensity of non-specific binding under these conditions.  To overcome dissociation of weak protein interactions, a method was developed using chemical cross-linking to preserve weak protein interactions on lymphoid cells. Affinity purification was used to purify CD4 along with cross-linked associated proteins and mass spectrometry analysis identified an interaction with the transferrin receptor CD71 and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. The CD45-CD4 interaction is well known. The CD4-CD71 interaction was demonstrated to be a result from colocalization of the two molecules during formation of endocytic vesicles. Flow cytometry-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements were applied to confirm colocalization. A similar interaction was suspected for CD4 and DC-SIGN on the plasma membrane of DCs as cis infection of DCs has been demonstrated i.e. initial binding to DC-SIGN then to CD4/CCR5 on the same cell. Therefore, protein associations of DC-SIGN were investigated using the developed techniques. Using cross-linking, DC-SIGN was shown to assemble in large complexes on the surface of immature monocyte-derived DCs. Mass spectrometry analysis of the purified complexes identified them as homo-oligomers of DC-SIGN. The absence of CD4 suggested that the fraction interacting with CD4 at any one time must be small. The complexes of DC-SIGN were further characterised to be tetramers and successfully co-immunoprecipitated with HIV gp120 and mannan. DC-SIGN monomers were not evident demonstrating that the assembly of DC-SIGN into tetramers is required for high affinity binding of its natural and viral ligands. Thus potential antiviral agents aimed at blocking the early stage of HIV binding to DCs must simulate tetramers in order to neutralise the virus efficiently. Overall the thesis provides new information on protein interactions of CD4 and DC-SIGN, a careful investigation of "proteomics" techniques for identifying the proteins in affinity-purified samples and demonstrates the need for multifaceted analytical approaches to probe complex cellular systems.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteomic;HIV Receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/585</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HUMAN FACE RECOGNITION BASED ON FRACTAL IMAGE CODING</field><field name="creator">Tan, Teewoon</field><field name="description">Human face recognition is an important area in the field of biometrics. It has been an active area of research for several decades, but still remains a challenging problem because of the complexity of the human face. In this thesis we describe fully automatic solutions that can locate faces and then perform identification and verification. We present a solution for face localisation using eye locations. We derive an efficient representation for the decision hyperplane of linear and nonlinear Support Vector Machines (SVMs). For this we introduce the novel concept of $\rho$ and $\eta$ prototypes. The standard formulation for the decision hyperplane is reformulated and expressed in terms of the two prototypes. Different kernels are treated separately to achieve further classification efficiency and to facilitate its adaptation to operate with the fast Fourier transform to achieve fast eye detection. Using the eye locations, we extract and normalise the face for size and in-plane rotations. Our method produces a more efficient representation of the SVM decision hyperplane than the well-known reduced set methods. As a result, our eye detection subsystem is faster and more accurate.    The use of fractals and fractal image coding for object recognition has been proposed and used by others. Fractal codes have been used as features for recognition, but we need to take into account the distance between codes, and to ensure the continuity of the parameters of the code. We use a method based on fractal image coding for recognition, which we call the Fractal Neighbour Distance (FND). The FND relies on the Euclidean metric and the uniqueness of the attractor of a fractal code. An advantage of using the FND over fractal codes as features is that we do not have to worry about the uniqueness of, and distance between, codes. We only require the uniqueness of the attractor, which is already an implied property of a properly generated fractal code.    Similar methods to the FND have been proposed by others, but what distinguishes our work from the rest is that we investigate the FND in greater detail and use our findings to improve the recognition rate. Our investigations reveal that the FND has some inherent invariance to translation, scale, rotation and changes to illumination. These invariances are image dependent and are affected by fractal encoding parameters. The parameters that have the greatest effect on recognition accuracy are the contrast scaling factor, luminance shift factor and the type of range block partitioning. The contrast scaling factor affect the convergence and eventual convergence rate of a fractal decoding process. We propose a novel method of controlling the convergence rate by altering the contrast scaling factor in a controlled manner, which has not been possible before. This helped us improve the recognition rate because under certain conditions better results are achievable from using a slower rate of convergence. We also investigate the effects of varying the luminance shift factor, and examine three different types of range block partitioning schemes. They are Quad-tree, HV and uniform partitioning. We performed experiments using various face datasets, and the results show that our method indeed performs better than many accepted methods such as eigenfaces. The experiments also show that the FND based classifier increases the separation between classes.    The standard FND is further improved by incorporating the use of localised weights. A local search algorithm is introduced to find a best matching local feature using this locally weighted FND. The scores from a set of these locally weighted FND operations are then combined to obtain a global score, which is used as a measure of the similarity between two face images. Each local FND operation possesses the distortion invariant properties described above. Combined with the search procedure, the method has the potential to be invariant to a larger class of non-linear distortions. We also present a set of locally weighted FNDs that concentrate around the upper part of the face encompassing the eyes and nose. This design was motivated by the fact that the region around the eyes has more information for discrimination. Better performance is achieved by using different sets of weights for identification and verification. For facial verification, performance is further improved by using normalised scores and client specific thresholding. In this case, our results are competitive with current state-of-the-art methods, and in some cases outperform all those to which they were compared. For facial identification, under some conditions the weighted FND performs better than the standard FND. However, the weighted FND still has its short comings when some datasets are used, where its performance is not much better than the standard FND. To alleviate this problem we introduce a voting scheme that operates with normalised versions of the weighted FND. Although there are no improvements at lower matching ranks using this method, there are significant improvements for larger matching ranks.    Our methods offer advantages over some well-accepted approaches such as eigenfaces, neural networks and those that use statistical learning theory. Some of the advantages are: new faces can be enrolled without re-training involving the whole database; faces can be removed from the database without the need for re-training; there are inherent invariances to face distortions; it is relatively simple to implement; and it is not model-based so there are no model parameters that need to be tweaked.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human face recognition;fractal image coding;fractal neighbour distance;FND;face identification;face verification;face authentication;face detection;eye detection;support vector machine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/586</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optical considerations in solar concentrating systems</field><field name="creator">Buie, Damien Charles William</field><field name="description">To optimise the performance of concentrating solar power systems, a detailed knowledge of the resultant flux distribution in the imaging plane is required. To achieve this, an accurate model of the direct solar beam impinging on the concentrator is essential. This thesis presents an empirical model of the terrestrial solar distribution that has both a high-correlation to observed data and an invariance to a change in location. The model is based on the amount of circumsolar radiation in the direct beam and takes into account the small variations that are due to atmospheric scattering.        A modelling framework is developed  to simulate the flux distribution in the imaging plane of a generic solar concentrating system. Algorithms are developed to include the following:  the spatial solar energy distribution; the systemic effect of reflecting that distribution off a non-ideal mirrored surface;  the spectral energy distribution;  the transmission, absorption and reflection characteristics of optical thin films; and the coordinates of the solar vector.      The framework is then used to investigate the performance of anti-reflection coatings on silicon substrates and the performance of linear Fresnel systems.  Combined, these algorithms and simulation tools  can be applied to create comprehensive optical models of solar concentrating systems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar power;concentrating systems;insolation;radial distribtution.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three Essays on the Impact of Electronic Screen Trading in Futures Markets</field><field name="creator">Hill, Amelia Mary</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of 3 essays that examine the impact of electronic screen trading in futures markets.

Due to disruption to normal sleep patterns, many patients with OSA suffer from increased daytime sleepiness. Epidemiological studies have established a link between OSA and driver fatigue and accidents, generally showing a two to seven times increased risk of road traffic accidents in non-commercial drivers with OSA. There is emerging evidence that commercial drivers have a higher prevalence of OSA than the general population, being predominately male, middle-aged and overweight, three important risk factors for OSA. However, little is known about the relationship between OSA and driver sleepiness in commercial drivers, whether road accidents are increased in commercial drivers with OSA, and whether OSA interacts with other fatigue promoting factors, such as sleep deprivation, to further escalate road accident risk.     One thousand randomly selected commercial drivers were surveyed in the field. In addition, 61 randomly selected NSW commercial drivers had in hospital sleep studies and daytime performance testing, including a PC based driving simulator task. The prevalence of OSA, defined as Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) &lt; 10, was approximately 50% in NSW commercial drivers. Approximately one quarter of the drivers reported pathological daytime sleepiness, and 12-14% had both OSA and pathological daytime sleepiness. A diagnosis of OSA was the most important factor predicting excessive daytime sleepiness in these drivers: OSA was more important than 15 other work-related, lifestyle and medical factors that could be expected to promote, or be associated with, daytime sleepiness. Drivers with sleep apnoea syndrome (both OSA and pathological daytime sleepiness) had an increased driving accident risk, using driving simulator and daytime performance testing as proxy measures for accident risk. These results demonstrate the importance of OSA as a cause of driver fatigue in commercial drivers and suggest that all commercial drivers should be screened for the presence of sleep apnoea syndrome in order to potentially reduce road accident risk through treatment.     A separate, but related body of work examined the combined effects of mild OSA and other fatigue promoting factors (sleep deprivation and circadian influences) on driving performance. Twenty nine subjects, consisting of a group with mild OSA and a group of non-OSA controls, were tested on several occasions throughout the night and day using an intensive performance battery, under both baseline conditions and after a period of 36 hours of total sleep deprivation. The results suggest that drivers with mild OSA are not different to the control group in their response to sleep deprivation or time of day influences. However, the subjects with mild OSA were less aware of their impairment due to sleep deprivation, which is of concern if drivers with OSA are relying on their subjective awareness of fatigue to make decisions about when to stop driving.      A final perspective on OSA and driver fatigue is provided through a clinical case series of seven fall-asleep fatality associated MVA&#65533;s associated with unrecognised or under-treated sleep disorders. As well as demonstrating the day to day potential for devastating road accidents due, at least in part, to un-recognised or untreated sleep disorders, these cases also serve to highlight some of the current medico-legal controversies and difficulties in this area of driver fatigue.       In conclusion, this body of work has provided novel information about the epidemiology and implications of OSA in commercial drivers, and about how OSA interacts with other fatigue promoting factors. Finally, it has explored some of the medico-legal issues that relate to sleep disorders and driver fatigue. As well as providing much needed information in the area of driver fatigue, at the same time this work raises many more questions and suggests areas of future research. For instance, such research should examine the relationship between objective accident rates and OSA/sleep apnoea syndrome in commercial drivers, the interaction between mild sleep apnoea syndrome and other fatigue risk factors, and driver perception of sleepiness prior to sleep onset in drivers with sleep disorders.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">obstructive sleep apnoea;driver performance;driving;driving simulator;sleep disorder</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/589</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To Hell in a Handcart Educational realities, teachers' work and neo-liberal restructuring in NSW TAFE</field><field name="creator">Clark, Judith</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of neo-liberal economic restructuring on teachers, specifically teachers in technical and further education. Historically, there has been limited research undertaken on teachers as workers, and even less on TAFE teachers. During the period covered by the study, TAFE was buffeted by the massive changes, social, political, cultural and economic, that were occurring on a global scale. As a result, TAFE has been a system in crisis. The consequences are addressed by an empirical study that examines NSW TAFE teachers' experience of the great changes that have occurred to their work since the late 1980s.  Forty-one teachers were interviewed in tape recorded sessions lasting around one hour each. The respondents were drawn from twenty-seven teaching sections across all the major industry areas represented in TAFE. Twenty of the teachers were from metropolitan locations, twenty-one were regional. Nine managers were also interviewed, from Head of Studies to senior management levels, covering those with local as well as state-wide responsibilities.  The changes to TAFE have been driven by a pervasive neo-liberal ideology adopted by both major parties in Australia. This study documents the experience of TAFE teachers as that ideology led to a corporatised vocational education and training system strongly oriented to the market. It also records their responses to the narrowing of curriculum that resulted from the "industry-driven" vocational education and training policies of governments. The study gives voice to their grief, frustration and anger as their working conditions deteriorated and their commitment to quality education was undermined.   The study documents the teachers' resistance to the processes of organisational fragmentation, the increasing incidence of cost-driven, rather than educational, decision-making, and the commodification of curriculum driven by a series of policy decisions taken at both national and state level.  The study compares these experiences with those of the TAFE managers, whose response to the crisis, while differing from that of the teachers, supports the teachers' commitment to public education as a social good.  The study concludes that the NSW TAFE teachers' resistance has continued to act as a brake on the excesses of neo-liberalism. Some possibilities for an alternative vision of technical and further education thus remain.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neo-liberalism;vocational education and training;technical and further education;TAFE;TAFE teachers;teachers' work;economic restructuring and vocational education;teachers' resistance;commodification of education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">User hints for optimisation processes</field><field name="creator">Do Nascimento, Hugo Alexandre Dantas</field><field name="description">Innovative improvements in the area of Human-Computer Interaction and User Interfaces have en-abled  intuitive and effective applications for a variety of problems. On the other hand, there has  also been the realization that several real-world optimization problems still cannot be totally auto-mated.  Very often, user interaction is necessary for refining the optimization problem, managing  the computational resources available, or validating or adjusting a computer-generated solution.  This thesis investigates how humans can help optimization methods to solve such difficult prob-lems.  It presents an interactive framework where users play a dynamic and important role by pro-viding  hints. Hints are actions that help to insert domain knowledge, to escape from local minima,  to reduce the space of solutions to be explored, or to avoid ambiguity when there is more than one  optimal solution. Examples of user hints are adjustments of constraints and of an objective function,  focusing automatic methods on a subproblem of higher importance, and manual changes of an ex-isting  solution. User hints are given in an intuitive way through a graphical interface. Visualization  tools are also included in order to inform about the state of the optimization process.  We apply the User Hints framework to three combinatorial optimization problems: Graph Clus-tering,  Graph Drawing and Map Labeling. Prototype systems are presented and evaluated for each  problem. The results of the study indicate that optimization processes can benefit from human  interaction.  The main goal of this thesis is to list cases where human interaction is helpful, and provide an ar-chitecture  for supporting interactive optimization. Our contributions include the general User Hints  framework and particular implementations of it for each optimization problem. We also present a  general process, with guidelines, for applying our framework to other optimization problems.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interactive optimisation;information visualisation;graph drawing;map labelling</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated study of group B streptococcus and human ureaplasmas &#65533; the paradigm shifts</field><field name="creator">Kong, Fanrong</field><field name="description">Group B streptococcus (GBS, S. agalactiae) and human ureaplasmas (U. parvumand U. urealyticum) are two clinically and phylogenetically related, potential perinatal pathogens. Their relationships between genotypes and pathogenesis of GBS and ureaplasma infection were still not well understood, one of the reason is that both of them are still short of a very practical genotyping system. In the study, to solve the above problem we developed genotyping systems for the organisms (the second section). For human ureaplasmas, based on four genes/gene clusters (rRNAgene clusters, the elongation factor Tu genes, urease gene complexes and multiplebanded antigen genes), we designed many primer pairs suitable for developing species identification assays for the two newly established human ureaplasma species (U. parvum and U. urealyticum). Further, based on the heterogeneity of ureaplasma multiple banded antigen gene (which contains species- and serovar-specific regions), we developed genotyping methods for each ureaplasma species.For GBS, based on three sets of molecular markers (capsular polysaccharidesynthesis gene clusters, surface protein antigen genes and mobile genetic elements),we developed a genotyping system. The primary evaluation of the genotyping systems showed that the genotyping systems were practical alternative assays for the conventional serotyping and they will be useful to further explore the relationships between genotypes and pathogenesis of GBS and ureaplasma infection. In the study, we introduced novel data and tools into GBS and ureaplasma studies especially from genomic- and bioinformatics-based molecular microbiology(the third section). For two newly established human ureaplasma species, based on the U. parvum serovar-3 genome, and using the above four important genes/geneclusters, we exposed some interesting problems in the understanding of newureaplasma taxonomy especially in the post genomic era. For GBS, we studied the two published full genomes and exposed some new problems or possible future new research fields. In particular we found the two finished and one ongoing GBS genomes were all non-typical and suggest that future genomic project had better have genetic population structure viewpoint. Finally, we suggested that integrated studies of the two potential or conditional perinatal pathogens, from the viewpoint of evolution, would provide a new understanding angle of the pathogenesis of the two organisms. Studies suggested that during coevolution, human ureaplasmas(especially U. parvum) became friendlier than their ancestors to their human host (by losing most of its virulence genes); however, GBS tried to increase its invasive abilities (by getting more virulence genes) to fight against the human host attack.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group B streptococcus;human ureaplasmas</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Other Lives</field><field name="creator">Verden, Patricia</field><field name="description">The areas of investigation are the portrait, the gaze, the American filmmaker Errol Morris, representation of reality and subcultures.

The baseline study was commissioned and funded by the Federal Airports Corporation  (FAC), with measurements conducted in 1994 and 1995. A follow-up longitudinal  component to the study was subsequently commissioned and funded by the FAC in 1997,  and measurements conducted in the same year. As the same individuals were measured  and re-measured over changing conditions of exposure to aircraft noise, the quasiexperimental  nature of the study allowed inferences to be made regarding exposure to  aircraft noise and child BP.    The main hypotheses for testing were that BP, and within-subject longitudinal changes  in BP, are positively related to domestic jet aircraft noise exposure and longitudinal  changes in domestic jet aircraft noise exposure respectively. Subsidiary hypotheses tested  for evidence of short- and long-term BP adaptation effects where BPs were related to  prior changes to aircraft noise exposures.    A sample of 75 primary schools within a 20 km radius of Sydney Airport under various  noise exposure conditions, both existing and those projected with the advent of the new  runway, participated in the study. The baseline cohort comprised 1,230 Year 3/4 children  attending the schools in 1994 and 1995, and the follow-up participants comprised 628  of the original baseline sample re-measured in 1997. Study participants were enrolled by  active parental consent. The baseline response rate was approximately 40% of children  in the participating schools.    Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure readings of the children were taken  using automated BP measuring equipment along with anthropometric measurements  (heights, weights, skinfold thicknesses and waist measurements). Parental surveys  captured items pertaining to the child&#65533;s ethnic background as measured by the country  of birth of the child and parent(s), residential address and housing structure, child eating  habits and activity levels, along with family and child history of high blood pressure.  Aircraft noise exposure data were collected by the National Acoustic Laboratories and  processed into the energy-averaged noise metric used in Australia for aircraft noise  exposure assessment called the Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI). Mean  exposures for a given calendar month were used in the analysis. ANEI values were  geocoded to exact geographic locations using digitised street maps from which values  for each house and school address, also geocoded, were interpolated. A child BP  measured in a given month was matched to a aircraft noise exposure value both at their  school and residential address for that month for analysis.    After adjusting for confounding and other factors, the cross-sectional relationship  between BP and aircraft noise exposure was found to be inconsistent. SBP was nonsignificantly  negatively associated with school aircraft noise exposure at baseline (0.05  mmHg/ANEI, cluster-sampling-adjusted p&amp;gt0.05), but positively and non-significantly  associated with school aircraft noise exposure at follow-up (0.05 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05).  As for SBP, baseline DBP was significantly negatively related to school aircraft noise  exposure at (0.09 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;lt0.001) and non-significantly positively associated  with school aircraft noise exposure at follow-up (0.05 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05).  Within-subject BP changes, occurring from baseline to follow-up, regressed on  corresponding longitudinal changes in aircraft noise exposures produced inconsistent  results. SBP change was positively and non-significantly (0.027 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05)  associated with corresponding school aircraft noise exposure change, while SBP change  was negatively associated total aircraft noise exposure change (statistically nonsignificant,  0.06 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05). DBP changes were similarly and nonsignificantly  related to corresponding aircraft noise exposure changes.    Some evidence for short-term BP adaptation to recent changes in aircraft noise exposure  was found. Consistent negative associations between systolic and diastolic BP and recent  changes in school aircraft noise exposure were found. This association was statistically  significant at study baseline (SBP: 0.19 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;lt0.001; DBP: 0.12 mmHg/ANEI,  p&amp;lt0.001), and of similar magnitude although not statistically significant at  follow-up (SBP: 0.14 mmHg/ANEI; DBP: 0.10 mmHg/ANEI, p&amp;gt0.05). In the  presence of inconsistent cross-sectional BP-aircraft noise exposure associations, this  finding is consistent with evidence of a homoeostatic BP response to recent changes in  aircraft noise exposure, where resting BP returns to pre-existing levels unrelated to  aircraft noise exposure. The public health implication of this finding appears to be benign.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">blood pressure;aircraft noise;child</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on Tumour Active Compounds with Multiple Metal Centres</field><field name="creator">Daghriri, Hassan</field><field name="description">Four tumour active trinuclear complexes: DH4Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(  NH3)2(H2N(CH2)4NH2)2]Cl4, DH5Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(  NH3)2(H2N(CH2)5NH2)2]Cl4, DH6Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(  NH3)2(H2N(CH2)6NH2)2]Cl4, DH7Cl: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}2m-{trans-Pd(NH3)2-(  H2N(CH2)7NH2)2]Cl4 and one dinuclear complex DHD: [{trans-PtCl(NH3)2}&#65533;-{  H2N(CH2)6NH2}{trans-PdCl(NH3)2]Cl(NO3), have been prepared and characterised based  on elemental analyses, IR, Raman, mass and 1 H NMR spectral measurements. For the  trinuclear complexes, the synthesis has been carried out using a step-up method branching  out from the central palladium unit. A purity of about 95% has been obtained by repeated  dissolution and precipitation. The activity against human cancer cell lines including ovary  cell lines: A2780, A2780 cisR , A2780 ZD0473R , non small lung cell line: NCI-H640 and  melanoma: Me-10538 have been determined based on MMT assay. Cell uptakes, DNA-binding  have been determined for ovary cell lines: A2780, A2780 cisR . The nature of  interaction with pBR322 plasmid DNA and ssDNA has been studied for trinuclear complexes  DH4Cl, DH5Cl, DH6Cl and DH7Cl and the dinuclear complex DHD. Interaction of DH6Cl  with adenine and guanine has also been studied by HPLC. The compounds are found to  exhibit significant anticancer activity against cancer cell lines especially ovarian cancer cell  lines: A2780, A2780 cisR and A2780 ZD0473R . DH6Cl in which the linking diamine has six  carbon atoms is found to be the most active compound. As the number of carbon atoms in thelinking diamine is changed from the optimum value of six, the activity is found to decrease,  illustrating the structure-activity relationship. The increase in uptake of the trinuclear  complexes in A2780 cell line with the increase in size of the linking diamine coupled with  the low molar conductivity values found for the solutions of the compounds suggest that the  compounds would remain in solution as undissociated &#65533;molecules&#65533; and hence could cross the  cell membrane by passive diffusion. Much lower resistance factors for the all the  multinuclear compounds including DHD as applied to A2780 cisR cell line, as compared to  that for cisplatin, suggest that the compounds are able to overcome multiple mechanisms of  resistance operating in the cell line. All of the multinuclear complexes are expected to form  long-range interstrand GG adducts with DNA, causing irreversible global changes in the  DNA conformation but unlike cisplatin do not cause sufficient DNA bending to be  recognized by HMG 1 protein. Increasing prevention of BamH1 digestion with the increase  in concentration of the multinuclear compounds also provide support to the idea that the  compounds because of the formation of a plethora of interstrand GG adducts are able to  cause irreversible changes in DNA conformation. The results of the study show that indeed  new trinuclear tumour active compounds can be found by replacing the central platinum unit  in BBR3464 with other suitable metal units.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">platinum;palladium;tumour active;multiple metal centres;gel electriphoresis;cell uptake</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Illness Self-Schema in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</field><field name="creator">Denton, Fiona</field><field name="description">Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a relatively rare autoimmune disease with no known aetiology or cure. In addition to numerous physical symptoms, those living with SLE have also been shown to experience significant emotional and psychosocial difficulties. There has been little psychological research into SLE despite the rapidly increasing interest in health psychology and quality of life issues over the last two decades. One such issue that has commanded particular attention is that of cognitive bias in individuals with chronic pain and/or chronic illness. Cognitive bias toward illness-related information is theorised to indicate the presence of an illness self-schema, and is a valuable tool of investigation as it permits access to a level of cognitive structure that is inaccessible via self-report instruments.     The primary focus of the present study is to investigate recall bias for pain- and illness-related words in SLE patients. This bias is explored relative to the recall of neutral words and depression-related words, and also relative to the responses of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls. Two hypotheses are proposed: firstly, that bias is related to disease activity; and secondly, that bias is related to the combination of illness and depression.    The findings provide support for the second hypothesis, with the additional caveat that the nature of the pain/illness stimuli used is important in determining the presence of cognitive bias. No recall bias for illness-related words as a whole was found in any of the groups, nor was there evidence of a recall bias in the SLE and RA patients when they were divided according to depression status. However, when the illness words were examined separately according to &#65533;sensory pain&#65533; and &#65533;disability-related&#65533; words, a clear bias for disability words was found in the depressed patient group. It is concluded that there is a relationship between depression in chronically ill individuals, and the way in which such individuals process disability-related words. In accordance with the schema-enmeshment model (Pincus &amp; Morley, 2001), it is suggested that both a pain-schema and an illness-schema exist, and it is when these two schemas become enmeshed with the self-schema that depression occurs in chronic pain/chronically ill patients.     The cognitive bias assessment paradigm adopted in this study-one that is typically used in similar investigations-is lengthy, requires sophisticated equipment and can be difficult to interpret on an individual level. The present study investigates the relationship between cognitive biases in SLE patients and a recently-developed task, PRISM, which appears to symbolise the enmeshment of illness-, pain- and self-schemas. Analyses confirmed that recall of negative illness words was the only independent predictor of PRISM scores. This suggests that PRISM, a quick and easy task to administer, may have considerable usefulness as a clinical tool to assess information relevant to the enmeshment of illness- and self-schema. A greater understanding of schema and the processing styles of chronically ill patients will allow for more effective psychological treatment such that quality of life can be improved.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">systemic lupus erythematosus;cognitive bias;schema;chronic illness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/596</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of complex structural geometry in optical fibre drawing</field><field name="creator">Lyytik&#65533;inen, Katja Johanna</field><field name="description">Drawing of standard telecommunication-type optical fibres has been optimised in terms of optical and physical properties. Specialty fibres, however, typically have more complex dopant profiles. Designs with high dopant concentrations and multidoping are common, making control of the fabrication process particularly important. In photonic crystal fibres (PCF) the inclusion of air-structures imposes a new challenge for the drawing process.     The aim of this study is to gain profound insight into the behaviour of complex optical fibre structures during the final fabrication step, fibre drawing. Two types of optical fibre, namely conventional silica fibres and PCFs, were studied. Germanium and fluorine diffusion during drawing was studied experimentally and a numerical analysis was performed of the effects of drawing parameters on diffusion. An experimental study of geometry control of PCFs during drawing was conducted with emphasis given to the control of hole size. The effects of the various drawing parameters and their suitability for controlling the air-structure was studied. The effect of air-structures on heat transfer in PCFs was studied using computational fluid dynamics techniques.      Both germanium and fluorine were found to diffuse at high temperature and low draw speed. A diffusion coefficent for germanium was determined and simulations showed that most diffusion occurred in the neck-down region. Draw temperature and preform feed rate had a comparable effect on diffusion. The hole size in PCFs was shown to depend on the draw temperature, preform feed rate and the preform internal pressure. Pressure was shown to be the most promising parameter for on-line control of the hole size. Heat transfer simulations showed that the air-structure had a significant effect on the temperature profile of the structure. It was also shown that the preform heating time was either increased or reduced compared to a solid structure and depended on the air-fraction.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical fibre;fibre fabrication;fibre drawing;dopant diffusion;photonic crystal fibre;microstructured optical fibre;air-silica structured fibre;germanium diffusion;fluorine diffusion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Concept formation through iconicity: basic shapes and their metaphorical extensions in English and Japanese</field><field name="creator">Teranishi, Takahiro</field><field name="description">Abstract     One of the ways for a speaker to make sense of an object or event in the real world is to make use of iconicity between two things. Through iconic metaphorical extensions, the speaker connects the object or event to something else. In this study, I consider how speakers form concepts through iconic metaphorical extensions, examining how they metaphorically extend one concept to another. I suggest that all speakers use the same ways of forming metaphorical extensions and control metaphorical extensions according to their intentions and contexts.   Using basic and simple shapes (e.g. 0) and their related metaphorical expressions (e.g. `a circular argument'), I discuss the role of iconicity in metaphorical understanding, the relationship between concept and language, and metaphorical extensions as tools of concept formation. I conduct descriptive investigations using dictionaries and compare related senses for particular basic shapes between English and Japanese, looking at their polysemous networks and historical changes. Using questionnaires, interviews and tasks with native speakers of English and Japanese, I conduct experimental investigations to examine the speakers' associations in relation to basic shapes and the degree of iconicity in metaphorical extensions.   This study suggests that concepts, although probably stored in the mental space, are recreated every time they occur. Concept formation through iconic metaphorical extensions must be dynamic because it is based on 'extensions' of existing concepts, and must be universal to all speakers because metaphorical extensions are among the most basic mental activities of human beings. I propose dynamic and universal models which represent the way in which a speaker forms concepts, connecting a linguistic form and a mental picture and controlling iconic metaphorical extensions. These models contribute to understanding both similarities and differences in use of metaphorical extensions between English and Japanese.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">linguistics;metaphor;Japanese;metaphorical extensions;concept formation;iconicity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A randomised controlled trial of oxygen therapy on growth and development of preterm infants</field><field name="creator">Askie, Lisa Maree</field><field name="description">Background:     Physiological studies have shown that many preterm infants and infants with chronic lung disease may suffer chronic hypoxaemia, which possibly leads to poor growth and development.

Objective   The BOOST (Benefits Of Oxygen Saturation Targeting) trial is the first randomised trial to assess the long-term benefits and harms of two different oxygen saturation target ranges.      Methods:  BOOST was a multicentre, double blinded, randomised controlled trial that enrolled 358 infants born at less than 30 weeks&#65533; gestation who remained oxygen-dependent at 32 weeks postmenstrual age. They were randomly assigned to target either a functional oxygen saturation range of 91-94% (standard or control group) or 95-98% (higher or treatment group). The primary outcomes were growth and neurodevelopmental measures at 12 months corrected age. Secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay, retinopathy of prematurity, health service utilisation, parental stress, and infant temperament.       Results:   Prognostic baseline characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Mean birth weight and gestational age of enrolled infants was 917g and 26.5 weeks respectively.

The importance of the sample lies in   the fact  that it is the first BL Lac sample in   which initial selection has been made from optical  spectra, independent of the objects' flux levels   at X-ray and radio frequencies. These optically   selected candidate BL Lac objects thus provide an   unbiased sample (in terms of radio flux density)   with which to study the proportion of radio-  dominant and X-ray-dominant BL Lac objects in the   global population.      The observed number counts and redshift distribution   of the 2BL are consistent with theoretical predictions   based on the QSO evolutionary model. Given the   small number statistics we are not, however, able   to show that this distribution is significantly   different to that of the 2QZ/6QZ white dwarfs.   A median redshift of z=1.25 was computed for these   candidate BL Lacs, a value supported by redshift   information obtained for ~25% of the sample. This   median redshift is much higher than redshifts   found for  X-ray selected BL Lac objects and    suggests that in the past high redshift, low   luminosity, radio-weak BL Lacs may have been missed   in radio- and X-ray-selected samples.      From results of the above studies it appears that   this sample of optically selected candidate BL Lac   objects is different to that of hitherto known   radio-loud BL Lacs.

While the bony fish possibly had another, genome duplications are not generally a feature of vertebrate evolution and indeed the appearance of an antigen-adaptive immune recognition system may have served to limit the size that various vertebrate genomes, including that of the human, can in fact achieve. This initial step in vertebrate immune evolution, the establishment of recognition of non-self against the unique set of 'self' epitopes for an individual, provided an immensely powerful weapon in immune function with the ability to tailor a defense against as-yet-unseen dangers at any time albeit with the pitfall of autoimmune disease. As the recognition sites of the antigen receptor molecules such as TcR are produced by clonal modification of the segments provided in the germline and are thus not in the genome itself, pathogens have not been able to hijack this one component of the immune system in the way so many other components have been put to use throughout evolution, nor do these components necessarily reveal themselves as associated with disease through genome screens. Importantly, overall immune function is determined not just by the potential repertoire of recognition receptors but also by the ability of immunocompetent cells to migrate in a tissue specific fashion through the use of various chemokines and their receptors. Typical of the hijacking of an immune system component by a pathogen is the use of a chemokine ligand gene in the viral ancestor to SIV and HIV, allowing for virus binding to immunocompetent cells as is seen in the use of the CCR5 chemokine receptor by macrophage-tropic HIV strains. This thesis describes the allele and genotype frequencies for several TcR beta-chain variable segment polymorphisms in a population of MS patients compared with controls before and after stratification for HLA-DR15, polymorphism in the Apo-1 / Fas promoter, the DRB1 Val86/Val86 genotype, CCR5-delta32 and the HLA-DRA promoter. The thesis continues with CCR5-delta32 genotyping in IDDM, MS and SLE cohorts and then examines the question of the population of origin of the delta-32 allele of the CCR5 receptor for chemokine. Here, a case / control comparison of 122 RR-MS patients with 96 normal individuals was made for allele and genotype frequencies and for haplotypes formed by pairs of TCRB markers. Further analysis was made after HLA-DR15 stratification. Linkage disequilibrium was found between pairs of alleles of bv8s1, bv10s1, bv15s1 and bv3s1 loci in both patients and controls. In the RR-MS cohort, an increase in the allele frequency of bv8s1*2 was seen (p = 0.03) and the haplotype bv8s1*2 / bv3s1*1 was increased (p = 0.006), and both were found to be statistically significant. In the DR15-positive group, association between MS and TCRB was seen with the bv8s1*2 allele (p = 0.05) and the bv8s1*2 / bv10s1 haplotypes (p = 0.048), while the haplotype associations seen among the DR15-negative patients included the bv3s1*1 allele (bv10s1*1 / bv3s1*1, p = 0.022; bv8s1*2 / bv3s1*1, p = 0.048). While no associations were found after stratification for SDF1-3'A, Apo-1 / Fas or DRB1 there were modest interactions between bv3s1, bv10s1 and bv15s1 and the HLA-DRA promoter. These results support the involvement of the TCRB region in MS susceptibility. The further study of autoimmune disease here includes genotype analysis of CCR5-delta32 in type 1 diabetes (IDDM) and SLE. CCR5 is the major co-receptor for viral entry used by macrophage-tropic HIV strains and protection from infection is seen in homozygotes for CCR5-delta32. In diabetes, infiltration of pancreatic tissue by autoreactive T-cells involves secretion of multiple cytokines and chemokine receptor expression. Variation in the chemokine receptor CCR5 may result in differences in inflammatory cell migration in response to relevant chemokines. Adolescents with type 1 diabetes were genotyped for CCR5-delta32 (n = 626). The allele frequency was compared with that of 253 non-diabetic adolescents and with that of 92 adults with SLE. A reduced allele frequency was seen in type 1 diabetes compared with controls (0.092 vs 0.123, p = 0.05). This difference was not seen for the cohort of patients with SLE (freq = 0.114). A reduction in the number of CCR5-delta32/delta32 homozygotes, who lack CCR5, in the type 1 diabetes cohort was also seen and while not statistically significant (2 observed compared to 5.25 expected; p = 0.12) is interesting. These results suggest a partial protection from type 1 diabetes for CCR5-delta32 homozygous individuals is possible and that CCR5 has a potential role in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes. Global surveys of the CCR5-delta32 allele have confirmed a single mutation event in a Northeastern European population as the source of this allele. Here, Australian Ashkenazi Jews (n = 807) were found to have a CCR5-delta32 allele frequency of 14.6% while Australian Sephardic Jews (n = 35) had a frequency of 5.7% and non-Jewish Australian controls (n = 311) had an allele frequency of 11.25%. Data on birthplace of grandparents showed a gradient with highest CCR5-delta32 frequencies from Eastern European Ashkenazim (~19.5% for those whose four grandparents come only from Russia, Poland, Hungary, Austria and Czechoslovakia; n = 197) which differs significantly from the frequency seen in Ashkenazi Jews from Western Europe (n = 101, p = 0.001). Homozygotes for CCR5-delta32 were genotyped with 3p21 region microsatellites. This has defined an ancestral haplotype on which the mutation first occurred and helped to date this event to between 40 and 50 generations ago or just over a thousand years ago. The population gradient, combined with the dating of the mutation by microsatellite allele frequencies, suggests an origin for the CCR5-delta32 allele in a population ancestral to the Ashkenazim. The distribution in non-Jewish populations in northern Europe has led others to postulate spread of the mutation by Vikings. It is hypothesised here that the link between the two populations could be the kingdom of Khazaria with subsequent admixture into both Swedish Vikings and Ashkenazi Jews. The basic driving force of evolution is through selection and the immune system has a role which, through the survival pressure exerted by viruses and other pathogens, has the potential to exert a great deal of selective force on the various components of this system. The effects of this pronounced selection on an immune system component can be seen for example in the increase of the CCR5-delta32 allele over the last thousand years to the current frequency. As mentioned, some immune system components are not affected by such straightforward selection. In the case of the TCRBV segments, effects on the immune repertoire can occur through MHC interaction at the point of thymic entry and in the effects of various superantigens, but the actual binding pockets that recognise antigen are themselves unable to be selected for (or against). The findings presented in this thesis provide support for the association of TCRBV gene segments with multiple sclerosis and also provide support for the further study of the role of the CCR5-delta32 allele in type 1 diabetes. Furthermore, data presented here suggests that the CCR5-delta32 allele had an origin in the Khazar Kingdom just over a thousand years ago, accounting for the allele frequencies in both the Ashkenazi Jews and in lands frequented by the Vikings. The definition of an extended ancestral haplotype for the CCR5-delta32 allele shows how the effect of selection of an allele of one gene can carry with it specific alleles of a large number of other genes as well.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T-cell receptor;TCRBV;chemokine receptor;CCR5;multiple sclerosis;diabetes;Ashkenazi Jew;Khazar Kingdom</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/601</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Guilt, shame, and grief: an empirical study of perinatal bereavement</field><field name="creator">Barr, Peter</field><field name="description">Aim. The aim of the present research was to investigate the relationship of  personality guilt- and shame-proneness to grief and psychological dysphoria  following bereavement due to stillbirth or death in the newborn period.  Methods. Participating parents completed self-report questionnaire measures of  proneness to situational guilt and shame (Test of Self-Conscious Affect-2),  chronic guilt and shame (Personal Feelings Questionnaire-2) and interpersonal  guilt (Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire-67), grief (Perinatal Grief Scale-33) and  psychological dysphoria (General Health Questionnaire-28) one month (&#65533;early&#65533;,  N = 158) and 13 months (&#65533;late&#65533;, N = 149) after a perinatal death.  Results. Women compared with men self-reported more intense grief, anxiety  and depression one month after the death, but there were no significant sex  differences in grief or psychological dysphoria one year later.  Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that composite shame  (situational and chronic) explained a small but statistically significant  proportion of the variance in early total grief (adjusted R  2  = .09) and anxiety  (adjusted R  2  = .07) in women, and early total grief (adjusted R  2  = .19), anxiety  (adjusted R  2  = .13) and depression (adjusted R  2  = .10) in men. Composite guilt  (situational, chronic and interpersonal) controlled for shame did not make a  significant further contribution to the variance in early total grief, anxiety or  depression in either sex.  Composite shame explained not only significant but meaningful proportions of  the variance in late grief (adjusted R2=.27), anxiety (adjusted R2=.21) and depression (adjusted R2=.27) in women, and late grief (adjusted R2= .56),anxiety (adjusted R  2= .30) and depression (adjusted R2= .51) in men. Composite  guilt controlled for shame made significant further contributions to the variancein late grief (&#8710;R  2  = .21), anxiety (&#8710;R  2  = .16) and depression (&#8710;R  2  = .25) in  women, and late grief (&#8710;R  2  = .11) in men. Shame and guilt together explained a substantial proportion of the variance in late grief (adjusted R2= .45), anxiety (adjusted R2= .33) and depression (adjusted R2= .49) in women, and late grief (adjusted R2= .64), anxiety (adjusted R2= .35) and depression (adjusted R2= .56) in men.    Situational shame, chronic guilt and survivor guilt made positive unique  contributions to the variance in late grief in women. Chronic shame and  survivor guilt made unique contributions to the variance in late grief in men.  Situational guilt made a significant unique negatively valenced contribution to  the variance in late grief in women.  Early composite shame, but not guilt, predicted late grief, anxiety and  depression in men. Early composite shame and/or guilt did not predict late  grief, anxiety or depression in women.  Conclusion. Personality proneness to shame was more relevant to late grief,  anxiety and depression in men than in women, but survivor guilt was equally  important to late grief in both sexes. Chronic guilt and functional situational  guilt were pertinent to late grief, anxiety and depression in women, but not in  men. Personality shame- and guilt-proneness have important relationships with  parental grief after perinatal death that have not hitherto been recognised.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">guilt;shame;grief;perinatal bereavement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Components for Wide Bandwidth Signal Processing in Radio Astronomy</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Paul Philip</field><field name="description">In radio astronomy wider observing bandwidths are constantly desired for the reasons of improved sensitivity and velocity coverage. As observing frequencies move steadily higher these needs become even more pressing. In order to process wider bandwidths, components that can perform at higher frequencies are required.     The chief limiting component in the area of digital spectrometers and correlators is the digitiser. This is the component that samples and quantises the bandwidth of interest for further digital processing, and must function at a sample rate of at least twice the operating bandwidth. In this work a range of high speed digitiser integrated circuits (IC) are designed using an advanced InP HBT semiconductor process and their performance limits analysed. These digitiser ICs are shown to operate at up to 10 giga-samples/s, significantly faster than existing digitisers, and a complete digitiser system incorporating one of these is designed and tested that operates at up to 4 giga-samples/s, giving 2 GHz bandwidth coverage. The digitisers presented include a novel photonic I/O digitiser which contains an integrated photonic interface and is the first digitiser device reported with integrated photonic connectivity.     In the complementary area of analogue correlators the limiting component is the device which performs the multiplication operation inherent in the correlation process. A 15 GHz analogue multiplier suitable for such systems is designed and tested and a full noise analysis of multipliers in analogue correlators presented. A further multiplier design in SiGe HBT technology is also presented which offers benefits in the area of low frequency noise.     In the effort to process even wider bandwidths, applications of photonics to digitisers and multipliers are investigated. A new architecture for a wide bandwidth photonic multiplier is presented and its noise properties analysed, and the use of photonics to increase the sample rate of digitisers examined.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radio Astronomy;Indium Phosphide;Digitisers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postmortem Identification through matching dental traits with population data</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Paul Terence Girot</field><field name="description">In cases of forensic dental identification, a key factor in the comparison of  the dental status of deceased persons with antemortem dental records is  the matching of dental restorations in individual teeth.  Many studies have been performed showing the prevalence of dental  interventions. This has mostly been performed by counting the numbers  of decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT) in each mouth without  detailed data collection on a per-tooth basis.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the research question: to what  extent would data on the distribution and prevalence of restoration types in the  human dentition facilitate forensic identification?  A database program was developed to allow efficient collection and  collation of dental trait information. Provision was made for storing  information relating to a subject's individual teeth, such as restorative  materials used and surfaces filled. Other data, such as missing teeth, caries status on a per-individual tooth basis and presence and details of  types of prostheses may be stored.  iii  Data from patients attending a private group practice in Hobart was  collected and a system was devised to enable the likelihood of dental trait  occurrence to be calculated in cases of forensic dental identification.  The capabilities of the system are demonstrated in a series of mock cases of  dental identification. An opportunity to make use of the database for which it  was designed arose in relation to the analysis of person identification  evidence in a murder trial at the Tasmanian Supreme Court.  The use of this reference database in evidence invoked lengthy debate  involving the judge, crown prosecutor and defence barristers. The resulting  voire dire was resolved in favour of conclusions drawn from the use of the  database being admitted in evidence.  The legal precedent set in the Marlow trial may possibly offer  encouragement for practising odontologists to further the concept of establishing and using reference databases of dental traits in population  groups in other parts of Australia.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">forensic odontology;forensic dentistry;postmortem identification;antemortem records;population based records</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/604</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brainstem pathology in SIDS and in a comparative piglet model.</field><field name="creator">Machaalani, Rita</field><field name="description">This thesis tests the hypothesis that increased neuronal cell death in SIDS infants is related to the ability of risk factors, such as prone sleeping, to expose infants to intermittent hypercapnic hypoxia (IHH). Based on the hypothesis that the NMDA system is linked to neuronal death, by way of excitotoxicity, correlations were also sought between cell death and changes in NMDA receptor (NR1) expression in brainstem nuclei controlling cardiorespiratory function.     The first aim of this study was to verify that increased neuronal cell death occurs in SIDS infants. To verify a piglet model of SIDS risk factors, brainstem changes were examined in piglets exposed to IHH, and comparisons were made to changes seen in SIDS infants. The NMDA receptor was characterised in controls for both the human infant and the piglet groups. Comparisons of neuronal changes were made with SIDS infants, and piglets exposed to IHH.     Non-radioactive in-situ hybridisation and immunohistochemistry were performed on formalin fixed and paraffin embedded brainstem tissue to identify markers of cell death (caspase-3, active caspase-3, and TUNEL), and to examine NR1 mRNA and protein expressions. Staining was quantified using computerised image analysis software. Eight nuclei from the brainstem medulla (caudal in piglets, and mid in infants), and two nuclei from the rostral pons (infants) were studied.    The first dataset included human infants aged 1-6 months with a diagnosis of SIDS (n=15) or non-SIDS (n=10). The second dataset comprised developing piglets aged 13-14 days, with controls (n=6), against those exposed to IHH for 2 (n=6) or 4 (n=5) days. Increased neuronal cell death was not verified in the SIDS infants, but abnormalities in NR1 expression were present in selected nuclei of the medulla. Piglets exposed to IHH had increased neuronal cell death and changes in NR1 in selected nuclei of the medulla. There was also a positive correlation between increased cell death and high NR1 levels. Preliminary data showed that SIDS infants who usually slept prone had some differences in NR1 compared to those who did not usually sleep prone.     From these findings, it was concluded that IHH may underlie the abnormalities in NMDA receptor expression that are present in the brainstem of SIDS infants. Although IHH can induce an increase in neuronal cell death, its significance in the aetiology of SIDS is not known. In piglets, IHH induced cell death correlated with high NMDA expression in some brainstem nuclei, supporting the hypothesis that excitotoxicity may be involved in the mechanism for cell death. Moreover, this thesis presents for the first time, &#65533;preliminary pathological proof&#65533; of an association between prone sleeping and abnormal NMDA receptor expression in SIDS infants.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">apoptosis;brainstem;caspase-3;development;NMDA;piglets;sudden infant death syndrome;TUNEL.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microdebitage and the Archaeology of Rock Art:  an experimental approach</field><field name="creator">Susino, George James</field><field name="description">The search for a reliable and non-invasive technique for the dating of rock art has  produced an array of different, localised, and limited techniques. This is one of  them. Still in its experimental stage, the recognition of quartz microdebitage  produced by the pecking of engravings is the aim of this project.  This investigation aims to establish whether microdebitage from rock engravings  can be distinguished from other sediments. Analysis of microdebitage from rock  engraving experiments was used to determine the difference between  experimental and naturally derived particles. This research discusses  methodology, and applications for the recognition of quartz grain features,  derived from experimental and natural material from Mutawintji National Park  (Broken Hill, NSW, Australia) and the Sydney region (NSW Australia).  A three-step process was devised for this research:   What features occur on non-cultural quartz grains?   What features occur on rock engraving quartz grains? Are they  different?   Can rock engraving quartz microdebitage be identified under natural  conditions?  Microdebitage from rock engravings was examined using optical and scanning  electron microscopy to identify diagnostic attributes, with the objective of  assessing the potential of microdebitage for spatial and temporal archaeological  investigation. Characteristics of the quartz grains in the microdebitage were  compared with quartz from differing environments. The observation of  diagnostic features on quartz grains made it possible to discriminate between  microdebitage from rock engravings and the natural soil background. This  knowledge may be applied to excavated material from archaeological sites, for  identifying episodes of rock engraving and other lithic activity in temporal  relation to other evidence of cultural activity.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1.

The study reports on an empirical investigation of the concept of text. The investigation proceeds on the basis of a corpus of texts gathered in sociolinguistic interviews with fifty adult speakers of Australian English in Sydney. The total corpus accounted for in terms of text type or genre numbers 420 texts of varying length, 125 of which, produced in response to four narrative questions, are investigated in greater detail in respect both of the types of text they constitute as well as of some of their linguistic realisations. These largely narrative-type texts, which represent between two and three hours of spoken English and total approximately 53000 words, are presented in a second volume analysed in terms of their textual or generic structure as well as their realisation at the level of the clause complex. The study explores in some detail models of register and genre developed within systemic-functional linguistics, adopting a genre model developed by J.R. Martin and others working within his model which foregrounds the notion that all aspects of the system(s) involved are related to one another probabilistically.   In order to investigate the concept of text in actual discourse under conditions which permit us to become sufficiently confident of our understanding of it to proceed to generalisations about text and its contextual conditioning in spoken discourse, we turn to Labovian methods of sociolinguistic inquiry, i.e. to quantitative methods or methods of quantifying linguistic choice. The study takes the sociolinguistic interview as pioneered by Labov in his study of phonological variation in New York City and develops it for the purpose of investigating textual variation. The question of methodology constitutes a substantial part of the study, contributing in the process to a much greater understanding of the very phenomenon of text in discourse, for example by addressing itself to the question of the feasibility of operationalising a concept of text in the context of spoken discourse.   The narrative-type texts investigated in further detail were found to range on a continuum from most experientially-oriented texts such as procedure and recount at one end to the classic narrative of personal experience and anecdote to the increasingly interpersonally-oriented exemplum and observation, both of which become interpretative of the real world in contrast to the straightforwardly representational slant taken on the same experience by the more experientially-oriented texts. The explanation for the generic variation along this continuum must be sought in a system of generic choice which is essentially cultural.   A quantitative analysis of clausal theme and clause complex-type relations was carried out, the latter by means of log-linear analysis, in order to investigate their correlation with generic structure. While it was possible to relate the choice of theme to the particular stages of generic structures, clause complex-type relations are chosen too infrequently to be related to stages and were thus related to genres as a whole. We find that while by and large the choice of theme correlates well with different generic stages, it only discriminates between different genres, i.e. generic structures in toto, for those genres which are maximally different. Similarly, investigating the two choices in the principal systems involved in the organisation of the clause complex, i.e. the choice of taxis (parataxis vs. hypotaxis) and the (grammatically independent) choice of logico-semantic relations (expansion vs. projection), we find that both those choices discriminate better between types more distant on a narrative continuum.   The log-linear analysis of clause complex-type relations also permitted the investigation of the social characteristics of speakers. We found that the choice of logico-semantic relations correlates with genre and question, while the choice of taxis correlates with a speaker's sex and his membership of some social group (in addition to genre). Parataxis is favoured by men and by members of the group lowest in the social hierarchy. Age on the other hand is not significant in the choice of taxis at all. In other words, since social factors are clearly shown to be significant in the making of abstract grammatical choices where they cannot be explained in terms of the functional organisation of text, we conclude that social factors must be made part of a model of text in order to fully account for its contextual conditioning.   The study demonstrates that an understanding of the linguistic properties of discourse requires empirical study and, conversely, that it is possible to study discourse empirically without relaxing the standards of scientific inquiry.</field><field name="date">1988</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">text linguistics</field><field name="subject">discourse linguistics</field><field name="subject">sociolinguistics</field><field name="subject">probabilistic grammar</field><field name="subject">variation study</field><field name="subject">Labovian quantificational methods</field><field name="subject">Hallidayan text linguistics</field><field name="subject">systemic-functional grammar</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An argument on culture safety in health service delivery: towards better health outcomes for Aboriginal peoples</field><field name="creator">Jackson Pulver, Lisa Rae</field><field name="description">The bureaucratic measure of health service, health performance indicators, suggest that we are not effective in our legislative responsibility to deliver suitable health care to some of the populations we are meant to serve.

They are among the oldest porphyry Cu-Au deposits in the Pacific Rim region. They are similar to younger deposits in terms of tectonic setting and structure, but the largest are chemically distinct, being associated with shoshonite magmas (Cadia, Ridgeway and Northparkes). The Lachlan Fold Belt (LFB) porphyries are subdivided into four sub-groups based mainly on their age relative to development of the Lachlan Transverse Zone (LTZ) structure. Two subgroups pre-date the LTZ, one group is syn&#65533;LTZ and one group post-dates the LTZ. No mineralisation has been found or reported among pre-I.TZ porphyries. but it is common in post- . l Z_ porphyries.  Petrographic analysis and microprobe results establish a wide range of primary and secondary features within the Ordovician rocks examined in this study. Cale alkaline to shoshonitic affinities are supported by the variable abundance of primary K-feldspars. Primary mineral phases such as pyroxenes and igneous magnetite provide an indication of fractioning mineral assemblages responsible for igneous trends in magma chemistry. The hydrothermal mineral assemblages documented in these LFB study areas are characteristic of younger Cu-Au Porphyry style mineralisation. As expected, the most pervasive alteration is associated with highly mineralised shoshonitic Ordovician rocks at Ridgeway, and Cadia. the less strongly mineralised calc alkaline Ordovician rocks at Cargo. Copper Ilill and Fairholme. are correspondingly less strongly altered overall. although secondary mineral assemblages are locally abundant. Many varieties of oxides and carbonates are observed at the different study localities.  Most of the studied samples conform to igneous chemical trends because they are weakly altered, although post magmatic processes, such as veining, are detectable in certain trends. The K2O enrichment of the studied samples is consistent with subductionmoditied mantle wedge sources. A few effects, such as the high Fe203 contents of some Ridgeway samples, probably reflect porphyry-style hydrothermal alteration processes. Host rocks at the Cadia and Ridgeway are entirely alkalic on the K2O versus SiO2 plot and shoshonitic on the Total Alkalies versus SiO2 plot. Igneous rocks at the other deposits display a range of compositions between low K tholeiites to shoshonites that in some cases reflects multiple igneous suites.  The LREE and L1LE enrichments, and HFSE depletions (Nb, Ta and Ti) of the magmas associated with these deposits are characteristics of a subduction-related tectonic setting. They all fall in the volcanic-arc granite and syn-collisional granite field of the Nb-Y tectonic discrimination diagram. Several magma types are identified by differences in the HFSE and REE trends. Differences in the extent and style of magma fractionation are evident in the trace element data. The Ridgeway samples define a wider range of trace element concentrations than the Cadia samples that may indicate a greater extent of fractionation during emplacement of the Ridgeway magmas. Fairholme samples display a high Nh and /If trends that are distinct from the main fields on Zr variation diagrams.  Compositional differences between larger Cu-Au deposits, Cadia-Ridgeway and smaller deposits, Copper Ifill, Cargo and Fairholme are evident in terms of Nb-Ta depletion and variation. The smaller deposits show constant Nb/Ta or negative Nb/Ta trends that extend to high Nb. The larger deposits display positive Nb/Ta trends that do not extend to high Nb. This distinction reflects a difference of preferential incorporation of Nb in a mineral phase (magnetite). Comparisons between Cadia-Ridgeway and other shoshonite (altered samples of Bajo de la Alumbrera, Argentina), calc alkaline magmas  from New Zealand and rocks from other areas indicate that Nb/Ta is not directly correlated with the shoshonitic classification, K2O vs. SiO2, and that the Cadia-Ridgeway Nb and Ta variation is not the result of alteration. The fact that the weakly altered LFB Capertee shoshonites exhibit a narrow range of Nb and low Nb/Ta suggest the shoshonite trend for the LFB as a whole is a steep one on the Nb/Ta versus Nb plot. The results of this study could provide important information for exploration within the LFB. Only the Cadia and Ridgeway deposits display a wide range of Nb/Ta values and lack the near-horizontal trend seen for other localities associated with smaller deposits. The tectonic evolution of the LFB is a major factor contributing to occurrence of large porphyry Cu-Au deposits. The sequence of important events, however, commences with sub-crustal generation of oxidised magma and finishes with efficient Cu-Au accumulation by hydrothermal processes at favourable structural sites. The increase in Au-Cu deposit size from small (Copper Hill-Cargo) to world class (Cadia-Ridgeway) indicates the importance of magma composition during this process. The most obvious differences between the Cadia-Ridgeway and New Zealand rocks is that the latter are volcanic in origin and associated with an arc-back arc system. Therefore, they did not form in a tectonic regime suitable for the evolution of porphyries and the focussed movement of hydrothermal fluids during dilatant episodes. As a result, they are not linked to mineralisation despite having Nb-Ta and Nb/Ta variations that are typical of the high oxidation states in Au-prospective magmas of the LFB.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">geology;petrography;geochemistry;tectonic factors;porphyry;copper-gold;Lachlan</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolution and impact of invasive species : cane toads and snakes in Australia</field><field name="creator">Phillips, Ben Lee</field><field name="description">Evolution can occur rapidly, along timescales that are traditionally regarded as 'ecological'.  Despite growing acceptance among biologists of rapid evolution, a strong paradigm of contemporary evolution is still absent in many sub-disciplines.  Here I apply a contemporary evolution viewpoint to conservation biology.  Specifically, I examine the impact of cane toads (Bufo marinus) on Australian snakes.  Toads were introduced into Australia in 1935, have spread rapidly and represent a novel, extremely toxic prey item to na&#65533;ve Australian predators (including snakes).  Based on dietary preferences and geographic distributions I find that 49 species of Australian snake are potentially at risk from the invasion of the toad.  Furthermore, examination of physiological resistance to toad toxin in 10 of these &#65533;at risk&#65533; species strongly suggests that most species of Australian snake are poorly equipped to deal with a likely dose of toad toxin.  Even species that are highly resistant to toad toxin (such as the keelback, Tropidonophis mairii) face indirect fitness costs associated with consuming toads.  Within a population of snakes however, the impact of toads is unlikely to be random.  For example, the examination of several component allometries describing the interaction between snakes and toads revealed that, within a species, smaller snakes are more likely to ingest a fatal dose of toad toxin than are larger snakes.   Further consideration of the interaction between snakes and toads suggests that toads will not only be exerting differential impact on snakes based upon morphology, but also exert non-random selection on prey preference and resistance to toad toxin in snake populations.  To examine the possibility of a morphological response by snakes to toads, I examined changes in the body size and relative head size of four species of snake as a consequence of time since exposure to toads.  Two of the species (green treesnakes and red-bellied blacksnakes) are predicted to face strong impacts from toads. These two species showed an increase in mean body size and a decrease in relative head size as a consequence of time since exposure to toads; both changes in an adaptive direction.  In contrast, the other two species (keelbacks and swampsnakes) are predicted to face much lower impact from toads, and these two species showed little or no evidence of morphological change associated with time since exposure to toads.  These results indicate an adaptive change in morphology at a rate that is proportional to the predicted level of impact for each species, strongly suggesting an evolved response.  Red-bellied blacksnakes (a toad-vulnerable species) were further assessed for evolved responses in prey preference and toxin resistance.  Comparisons between toad-exposed and toad-na&#65533;ve populations of blacksnakes revealed that snakes from toad-exposed populations exhibited slightly higher resistance to toad toxin and a much-reduced tendency to eat toads, when compared with toad-na&#65533;ve snakes.  Na&#65533;ve snakes exhibited no tendency to learn avoidance of toxic prey, nor were they able to acquire resistance to toxin as a result of several sub-lethal doses, suggesting that the observed differences between populations is evolved rather than acquired.  Together, these results strongly suggest that blacksnakes are exhibiting an evolved shift in prey preference and toxin resistance as a consequence of exposure to toads.  Thus, it appears that snakes are exhibiting adaptation at multiple traits in response to exposure to toads.  Given the high likelihood that these adaptive shifts have an evolved basis, it appears that the impact of toads will decrease with time in many snake populations.  But what about toads?  Because the outcome of the interaction between a toad and a snake is also mediated by the body size and relative toxicity of toads, it is important to understand how these traits vary in space and time.  Exploratory analysis revealed that toads exhibit a decrease in body size and a decrease in relative toxicity as a consequence of time since colonisation, indicating that their impact on native predators decreases with time.  Additionally, there appears to be meaningful spatial variation in toad relative toxicity, indicating that some populations of native predators are facing higher impact from toads than others.  Overall, these results clearly indicate the importance of assessing the potential for rapid evolutionary response in impacted systems.  Doing so may provide evidence that some species are in less trouble than originally thought.  Additionally, and as more data accumulate, it may be possible to characterise certain categories of environmental impact by their potential for eliciting adaptive response from &#65533;impacted&#65533; species.  This approach has strong implications for the way conservation priorities are set and the way in which conservation dependent populations are managed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alien Species;Bufo marinus;Predator-Prey;Pseudechis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A reformulation of Coombs' Theory of Unidimensional Unfolding by representing attitudes as intervals</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Timothy Kevin</field><field name="description">An examination of the logical relationships between attitude statements suggests that attitudes can be ordered according to favourability, and can also stand in relationships of implication to one another. The traditional representation of attitudes, as points on a single dimension, is inadequate for representing both these relations but representing attitudes as intervals on a single dimension can incorporate both favourability and implication.  An interval can be parameterised using its two endpoints or alternatively by its midpoint and latitude. Using this latter representation, the midpoint can be understood as the &#65533;favourability&#65533; of the attitude, while the latitude can be understood as its &#65533;generality&#65533;. It is argued that the generality of an attitude statement is akin to its latitude of acceptance, since a greater semantic range increases the likelihood of agreement.  When Coombs&#65533; Theory of Unidimensional Unfolding is reformulated using the interval representation, the key question is how to measure the distance between two intervals on the dimension. There are innumerable ways to answer this question, but the present study restricts attention to eighteen possible &#65533;distance&#65533; measures. These measures are based on nine basic distances between intervals on a dimension, as well as two families of models, the Minkowski r-metric and the Generalised Hyperbolic Cosine Model (GHCM). Not all of these measures are distances in the strict sense as some of them fail to satisfy all the metric axioms.  To distinguish between these eighteen &#65533;distance&#65533; measures two empirical tests, the triangle inequality test, and the aligned stimuli test, were developed and tested using two sets of attitude statements. The subject matter of the sets of statements differed but the underlying structure was the same. It is argued that this structure can be known a priori using the logical relationships between the statement&#65533;s predicates, and empirical tests confirm the underlying structure and the unidimensionality of the statements used in this study. Consequently, predictions of preference could be ascertained from each model and either confirmed or falsified by subjects&#65533; judgements.  The results indicated that the triangle inequality failed in both stimulus sets. This suggests that the judgement space is not metric, contradicting a common assumption of attitude measurement. This result also falsified eleven of the eighteen &#65533;distance&#65533; measures because they predicted the satisfaction of the triangle inequality.  The aligned stimuli test used stimuli that were aligned at the endpoint nearest to the ideal interval. The results indicated that subjects preferred the narrower of the two stimuli, contrary to the predictions of six of the measures. Since these six measures all passed the triangle inequality test, only one measure, the GHCM (item), satisfied both tests. However, the GHCM (item) only passes the aligned stimuli tests with additional constraints on its operational function. If it incorporates a strictly log-convex function, such as cosh, the GHCM (item) makes predictions that are satisfied in both tests. This is also evidence that the latitude of acceptance is an item rather than a subject or combined parameter.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attitudes;Measurement;Unfolding;Coombs;Hyperbolic Cosine Model;Rasch;Triangle Inequality;Metric;Minkowski;Scaling;Unidimensional;Multidimensional</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/612</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modes and propagation in microstructured optical fibres</field><field name="creator">Issa, Nader</field><field name="description">Microstructured optical fibres (MOFs), also commonly called photonic crystal fibres or holey fibres, describe a type of optical fibre in which continuous channels of (typically) air run their entire length. These `holes' serve to both confine electromagnetic waves within the core of the fibre and to tailor its transmission properties.  In order to understand and quantify both of these functions, a new computational algorithm was developed and implemented. It solves for the eigenvalues of Maxwell's wave equations in the two-dimensional waveguide cross-section, with radiating boundary conditions imposed outside the microstructure. This yields the leaky modes supported by the fibre.  The boundary conditions are achieved exactly using a novel refinement scheme called the Adjustable Boundary Condition (ABC) method.  Two implementations are programmed and their computational efficiencies are compared. Both use an azimuthal Fourier decomposition, but radially, a finite difference scheme is shown to be more efficient than a basis function expansion. The properties of the ABC method are then predicted theoretically using an original approach.  It shows that the method is highly efficient, robust, automated and generally applicable to any implementation or to other radiating problems. A theoretical framework for the properties of modes in MOFs is also presented. It includes the use of the Bloch-Floquet theorem to provide a simpler and more efficient way to exploit microstructure symmetry.  A new, but brief study of the modal birefringence properties in straight and spun fibres is also included.  The theoretical and numerical tools are then applied to the study of polymer MOFs.  Three types of fibres are numerically studied, fabricated and characterised.  Each is of contemporary interest. Firstly, fabrication of the first MOFs with uniformly oriented elliptical holes is presented.  A high degree of hole ellipticity is achieved using a simple technique relying on hole deformation during fibre draw. Both form and stress-optic birefringence are characterized over a broad scaled-wavelength range, which shows excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Secondly, an analysis of leaky modes in real air core MOFs, fabricated specifically for photonic band gap guidance, is then used to identify alternative guiding mechanisms. The supported leaky modes exhibit properties closely matching a simple hollow waveguide, weakly influenced by the surrounding microstructure. The analysis gives a quantitative determination of the wavelength dependent confinement loss of these modes and illustrates a mechanism not photonic band gap in origin by which colouration can be observed in such fibres. Finally, highly multimode MOFs (also called `air-clad' fibres) that have much wider light acceptance angles than conventional fibres are studied. An original and accurate method is presented for determining the numerical aperture of such fibres using leaky modes. The dependence on length, wavelength and various microstructure dimensions are evaluated for the first time for a class of fibres. These results show excellent agreement with published measurements on similar fibres and verify that bridge thicknesses much smaller than the wavelength are required for exceptionally high numerical apertures. The influence of multiple layers of holes on the numerical aperture and capture efficiency are then presented. It shows that a substantial increase in both these parameters can be achieved for some bridge thicknesses.  Simple heuristic expressions for these quantities are given, which are based on the physical insight provided by the full numerical models. The work is then supported by the first fabrication attempts of large-core polymer MOFs with thin supporting bridges. These fibres exhibit relatively high numerical apertures and show good agreement with theoretical expectations over a very wide scaled-wavelength range.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fibre;Fiber;Microstructure;Microstructured optical fibres;Microstructured optical fibers;Photonic crystal;Photonic crystal fibres;Photonic crystal fibers;Holey fibres;Holey fibers;Modes;Leaky modes;Numerical aperture;Capture efficiency;Birefringence;Confinement loss;Photonic band gap;Fourier decomposition;Adjustable boundary condition;Elliptical holes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational Explorations of Creativity and Innovation in Design</field><field name="creator">Sosa Medina, Ricardo</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses creativity in design as a property of systems rather than an attribute of isolated individuals. It focuses on the dynamics between generative and evaluative or ascriptive processes. This is in distinction to conventional approaches to the study of creativity which tend to concentrate on the isolated characteristics of person, process and product. Whilst previous research has advanced insights on potentially creative behaviour and on the general dynamics of innovation in groups, little is known about their interaction. A systems view of creativity in design is adopted in our work to broaden the focus of inquiry to incorporate the link between individual and collective change.     The work presented in this thesis investigates the relation between creativity and innovation in computational models of design as a social construct. The aim is to define and implement in computer simulations the different actors and components of a system and the rules that may determine their behaviour and interaction. This allows the systematic study of their likely characteristics and effects when the system is run over simulated time. By manipulating the experimental variables of the system at initial time the experimenter is able to extract patterns from the observed results over time and build an understanding of the different types of determinants of creative design. The experiments and findings presented in this thesis relate to artificial societies composed by software agents and the social structures that emerge from their interaction. Inasmuch as these systems aim to capture some aspects of design activity, understanding them is likely to contribute to the understanding of the target system.     The first part of this thesis formulates a series of initial computational explorations on cellular automata of social influence and change agency. This simple modelling framework illustrates a number of factors that facilitate change. The potential for a designer to trigger cycles of collective change is demonstrated to depend on the combination of individual and external or situational characteristics.     A more comprehensive simulation framework is then introduced to explore the link between designers and their societies based on a systems model of creativity that includes social and epistemological components. In this framework a number of independent variables are set for experimentation including characteristics of individuals, fields, and domains. The effects of these individual and situational parameters are observed in experimental settings. Aspects of relevance in the definition of creativity included in these studies comprise the role of opinion leaders as gatekeepers of the domain, the effects of social organisation, the consequences of public and private access to domain knowledge by designers, and the relation between imitative behaviour and innovation.     A number of factors in a social system are identified that contribute to the emergence of phenomena that are normally associated to creativity and innovation in design. At the individual level the role of differences of abilities, persistence, opportunities, imitative behaviour, peer influence, and design strategies are discussed. At the field level determinants under inspection include group structure, social mobility and organisation, emergence of opinion leaders, established rules and norms, and distribution of adoption and quality assessments. Lastly, domain aspects that influence the interaction between designers and their social groups include the generation and access to knowledge, activities of gatekeeping, domain size and distribution, and artefact structure and representation. These insights are discussed in view of current findings and relevant modelling approaches in the literature. Whilst a number of assumptions and results are validated, others contribute to ongoing debates and suggest specific mechanisms and parameters for future experimentation.     The thesis concludes by characterising this approach to the study of creativity in design as an alternative &#65533;in silico&#65533; method of inquiry that enables simulation with phenomena not amenable to direct manipulation. Lines of development for future work are advanced which promise to contribute to the experimental study of the social dimensions of design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creativity;creative design;innovation;diffusion;social simulation;cellular automata;design agents;situational factors;situatedness;social influence;creative design situations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/614</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Migration as feminisation: Chinese women&#65533;s experiences of work and family in contemporary Australia</field><field name="creator">Ho, Christina</field><field name="description">Throughout the Western world, governments have increasingly viewed migration through the lens of economic efficiency. In the era of globalisation, they argue, migrants should be selected on the basis of their skills and qualifications. Australian governments have been strongly committed to this policy direction, and over the last two decades, have reoriented the country&#65533;s migration program from the recruitment of unskilled labour to targeting educated professionals. The current Liberal-National Coalition government claims that this policy redirection has paid off, with migrants more skilled than ever, and successfully contributing to the economy. The government bases these claims on research conducted by scholars of migrant employment, who equate high levels of human capital with successful employment outcomes. Using the Longitudinal Survey of Immigrants to Australia (LSIA), these researchers show that migrants with qualifications and English language ability have higher rates of labour force participation, lower unemployment, and higher occupational attainment and incomes, compared to their less skilled counterparts. This thesis critically analyses this &#65533;success story&#65533; narrative. It argues that the focus on human capital has overshadowed exploration of other important factors shaping migrants&#65533; employment experiences, including the gender and birthplace of new arrivals. This thesis shows that male and female migrants, and migrants from English versus non-English speaking backgrounds, can have very different experiences of working in Australia, regardless of their skills or occupational histories. I highlight the importance of these factors by investigating the experiences of Chinese women in Australia today. Using in-depth interviews with women from China and Hong Kong, and quantitative data from the Australian census and LSIA, I show that Chinese women&#65533;s employment experiences in Australia do not conform neatly to the prevailing &#65533;success story&#65533; promoted by the Government and migration researchers.  Migration to Australia causes a widespread reduction in Chinese women&#65533;s paid work. While it is normal for men to seek work immediately after arrival, women find that migration intensifies their domestic workloads, while depriving them of sources of domestic support, such as relatives and hired help. Consequently, for Chinese women, migration often means moving from full-time to part-time jobs, or withdrawing from the workforce entirely. In the process, they experience a &#65533;feminisation&#65533; of roles, as they shift from being &#65533;career women&#65533; to fulfilling the traditional &#65533;female&#65533; roles of wife and mother. Thus migration and settlement are highly gendered, and the household context is crucial for understanding migrants&#65533; employment experiences. Among those women who are in the labour force, employment outcomes vary substantially by birthplace, pointing to the cultural specificity of human capital. Although both mainland Chinese and Hong Kong migrant women tend to be highly educated, mainland women achieve far poorer outcomes than Hong Kong women. Hong Kong women, with their relatively good English language skills and officially-recognised qualifications, are generally able to secure comparable jobs to those they had in Hong Kong, although they often have problems advancing further in Australia. Meanwhile, mainland women tend to have poorer English skills and greater difficulty in having their qualifications recognised, and thus suffer often dramatic downward mobility, moving from highly skilled professions to unskilled, low-paid and low status jobs in Australia. Thus this thesis demonstrates that the value of human capital is context-dependent. It can only be valorised in a new labour market if it is sufficiently culturally compatible with local standards. Therefore, the experiences of Chinese migrant women complicate the &#65533;success story&#65533; that dominates discussions of migrant employment in Australia. Ultimately, the prevailing economistic approach fails to see the diversity and complexity of migrant experiences. We need to see migrants as social beings, whose settlement in a new country is crucially shaped by their gender and birthplace, and broader institutional factors, which determine how human capital is used and rewarded. This is the mission of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">migration;migrant women;work;family;identity</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quality of life after a critical illness: a review of the literature 1998-2003</field><field name="creator">Adamson, Harriet Caroline</field><field name="description">Until recently, long-term effects of a critical illness (CI) have received little attention from intensive care staff, who have traditionally measured outcome from an intensive care unit (ICU) by morbidity and mortality. However, it is now acknowledged that CI is a continuum that begins before ICU and continues to impact on a patient&#65533;s quality of life after they have been discharged home. Measuring health related quality of life (HRQOL) is a complex matter due to its multifaceted, subjective and dynamic nature. There has been a lack of consensus in the literature regarding the most appropriate methodological approaches and measuring instruments to use. This disparity has impeded comparison between studies.   The aim of this thesis was to review the literature between January 1998 and December 2003 that focused on HRQOL for patients after a CI to identify and summarise themes and key outcomes. There were two main areas of focus - the methods used to measure the effects of the CI, and evaluation of the patient outcomes.  An electronic search for relevant articles was conducted using the common clinical research databases and key words such as health related quality of life, outcomes and critical illness. Reference lists from these articles and conference proceedings were reviewed to identify further studies. There were 74 primary papers identified that reflected a number of subcategories including general ICU, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), and elderly patients.   There were four categories of instruments used in the literature including those that measured acuity of illness, physical functioning, psychological functioning and HRQOL. The majority of studies used more than one measuring instrument, most of which had been previously validated. Results from the studies were diverse, but it is apparent that physical and psychological recovery from a CI may be a slow and varied process. Most studies were observational; only one randomised control study examined the benefits of a physical exercise program for patients post-hospital discharge. In general, there was no evidence of how to translate the study findings into some form of structured program to assist the patient with any identified problems. To enhance continuum of care, integration of ICU, hospital and rehabilitation services could target identified physical and psychological problems to assist patient recovery. However, strong evidence on the benefits of initiatives such as inpatient follow-up, outpatient clinics and use of ICU diaries is yet to be demonstrated.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quality of life;health related quality of life;outcomes;intensive care;critical illness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHARACTERISTICS OF TWO POPULATIONS OF FUSARIUM ROSEUM &#65533;GRAMINEARUM&#65533; IN EASTERN AUSTRALIA</field><field name="creator">Francis, Rodney Gordon</field><field name="description">1. Fusarium roseum &#65533;Graminearum&#65533; was the predominant fungus associated with stalk rot of maize in eastern Australia in the 1972, 1973 and 1974 growing seasons. All isolates of this pathogen were of the Group 2 type. Thus Group 2 contrasts with Group I which is normally isolated :Erora crown rot of wheat and grasses. Other fungi isolated in order of frequency were Diplodia maydis, F. rnoniliforme &#65533;Subglutinans&#65533;, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Nigrospora oryzac, F. roseum &#65533;Semitectum&#65533;, F. moniliforme, F. roseum &#65533;Equiseti&#65533;, F. roseum &#65533;Concolor&#65533;, Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia sp., F. roseum &#65533;Acuminatum&#65533;, F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. tricinctum and F. roseum &#65533;Heterosporum&#65533;. The relative isolation frequencies of the fungi varied according to the seasonal conditions. Stalk rots were not of major importance in 1973, a relatively dry growing season. However, in 1974, a wet growing season, stalk rot diseases were common in all areas investigated. 2. Isolates of F. roseum &#65533;Graminearum&#65533;,derived mainly from wheat and maize but also from other sources and from various regions of eastern Australia, were examined for perithecia formation, colony characteristics, fertility, colony growth, conidia production and conidia size. The distribution of the fungus in field colonized maize and wheat plants was also studied. The Group 1 isolates did not produce perithecia, were heterothallic and very infertile, had a mean colony growth of 4.4 cm per 3 days (range, 3.9- 5.1) and produced relatively large numbers of conidia. In contrast, Group 2 isolates were homothallic and produced perithecia readily, had a mean colony growth of 5.4 cm per 3 days (range, 4.7&#65533;6.1) and produced relatively low numbers of conidia. Group 1 isolates were found to be commonly associated with crowns and roots of plants and Group 2 isolates were commonly associated with aerial plant parts. 3. The ability of a number of Group 1 and Group 2 isolates to produce the fungal hormone, zearalenone was assessed. Group I isolates produced three to four times more zearalenone than Group 2 isolates. In addition, a. culture which had previously produced perithecia but had lost that ability following numerous transfers, produced no detectable zearalenone. The results provided good evidence that the observed difference in perithecia formation was directly related to the ability to produce zearalenone. 4. The pathogenicity to wheat, maize and carnations of Group 1 isolates from crown rot affected wheat plants and Group 2 isolates from stalk rot affected maize plants was tested. Pathogenicity of 11 other isolates from teosinte, carnations, pearl millet, wheat and barley scab, banana, ginger and common wheat grass was also assessed. The results indicated that pathogenic specialization exists within F. roseum &#65533;Graminearum&#65533;. Wheat isolates were the most pathogenic to wheat, carnation isolates were the most pathogenic to carnations and all maize isolates were pathogenic to maize while those from wheat and common wheat grass were not as pathogenic to maize. Moreover, Group 2 isolates were more pathogenic when inoculated in aerial plant parts, and the Group I isolates were more pathogenic when inoculated in plant parts in soil. Inoculations on wheat seedlings in sterile field soil demonstrated that the inherent pathogenicity to wheat seedlings of isolates from wheat and maize were similar. 5. Some factors which could contribute to the observed pathogenic differences between isolates from wheat and maize to wheat seedlings in field soil were examined. Conidia volume, germination rate and inherent germinability in the soil were studied. The Group I isolates had the largest volume, the most rapid germination and the highest inherent germinability. Pathogenicity was positively correlated with conidium volume and inherent germinability. In addition, the inherent germinability and conidium volume were positively correlated. Thus, it was established that pathogenic behaviour of conidia of Group 1 and Group 2 reflected differences in conidia morphology.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fusarium roseum graminearum;fungus;stalk rot;maize</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deleuze and Kant's Critical Philosophy</field><field name="creator">McMahon, Melissa Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the status of Deleuze as a Kantian, and as such committed both to the critical destiny of philosophy, and the contestation of the sense of this destiny.   The focus of Deleuze&#65533;s reading of Kant is an active conception of thought: the fundamental elements of thought are will and value rather than being or the concept.   In the development of this idea we can note a progressive 'tapering' of the foundational instance of thought, in three stages: from the speculative field of being to the practical field of reason; from the intellectual category of the concept to the problematic category of the Idea; from the teleological notion of the organism to the aesthetic notion of the singular.   Within each stage we can perceive a polemic between the two terms: it is in each case a question of the 'sufficient reason' of thought, its conditions of the actuality beyond its possibility.   The highest expression of our reason, for Kant, is neither theoretical nor utilitarian, but moral: the realisation of our lawful freedom. For Deleuze, on the other hand, the ultimate secret of our freedom and thus all of our thought is to be found rather in the realm of the aesthetic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">KANT;DELEUZE;CRITIQUE;AESTHETICS;PROBLEM;JUDGEMENT</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/618</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Parallel Solution Adaptive Implementation of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo Method</field><field name="creator">Wishart, Stuart Jackson</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method of analysing  gas flows. The DSMC method was initially proposed as a method for predicting  rarefied flows where the Navier-Stokes equations are inaccurate. It has now been  extended to near continuum flows. The method models gas flows using simulation  molecules which represent a large number of real molecules in a probabilistic  simulation to solve the Boltzmann equation. Molecules are moved through a simulation  of physical space in a realistic manner that is directly coupled to physical time such that  unsteady flow characteristics are modelled. Intermolecular collisions and moleculesurface  collisions are calculated using probabilistic, phenomenological models. The  fundamental assumption of the DSMC method is that the molecular movement and  collision phases can be decoupled over time periods that are smaller than the mean  collision time.    Two obstacles to the wide spread use of the DSMC method as an engineering tool are in  the areas of simulation configuration, which is the configuration of the simulation  parameters to provide a valid solution, and the time required to obtain a solution. For  complex problems, the simulation will need to be run multiple times, with the  simulation configuration being modified between runs to provide an accurate solution  for the previous run&#65533;s results, until the solution converges. This task is time consuming  and requires the user to have a good understanding of the DSMC method. Furthermore,  the computational resources required by a DSMC simulation increase rapidly as the  simulation approaches the continuum regime. Similarly, the computational  requirements of three-dimensional problems are generally two orders of magnitude  more than two-dimensional problems. These large computational requirements  significantly limit the range of problems that can be practically solved on an  engineering workstation or desktop computer.    The first major contribution of this thesis is in the development of a DSMC  implementation that automatically adapts the simulation. Rather than modifying the  simulation configuration between solution runs, this thesis presents the formulation of  algorithms that allow the simulation configuration to be automatically adapted during a  single run. These adaption algorithms adjust the three main parameters that effect the  accuracy of a DSMC simulation, namely the solution grid, the time step and the  simulation molecule number density.

Although not well characterised they play roles in cell growth and proliferation, hormone responses and other cell signalling events, but perhaps their most important role, especially in erythrocytes, is enabling the cell to respond to changes in both intra- and extracellular redox environments. Human erythrocytes possess a transmembrane electron transport capability that mediates the transfer of reducing equivalents from reduced intracellular species to oxidised extracellular species and is concomitant with proton extrusion.  In the work for this thesis I showed that erythrocyte membranes contain a transmembrane WST-1 (water soluble tetrazolium-1) reductase activity that uses reducing equivalents from intracellular NADH to reduce extracellular WST-1. The rate of WST-1 reduction was increased by the presence of phenazine methosulfate and, although of low activity, it showed similar properties to a previously reported transmembrane NADH-oxidase activity. 1H NMR experiments showed that WST-1 was reversibly bound to the membrane and/or proteins in the membrane within the timeframe of the NMR experiment, confirming the location of the WST-1 reduction.  Preliminary attempts to purify NADH:WST-1 reductase and NADH:ferricyanide reductase activities from the erythrocyte plasma membrane were inconclusive. The protein(s) responsible for the reduction of these oxidants appear to be of low abundance in the plasma membrane and may be part of a larger protein complex. Further work on the isolation of these redox activities is required before the protein(s) involved can be identified with any confidence.  The ability of cells to export electrons suggests that an electron import mechanism might also exist to re-establish the cell&#65533;s redox-buffering equilibrium under conditions of oxidative stress. This hypothesis was tested in glucose-deprived erythrocytes using reduced glutathione and NADH as extracellular electron donors. It was shown that neither reduced glutathione nor NADH donated reducing equivalents through a transmembrane redox system. Extracellular NADH was, however, able to produce profound changes in starvation metabolism and methaemoglobin reduction rates. The addition of extracellular NADH caused a six-fold increase in the rate of lactate production above that observed in glucose-starved controls, together with a concomitant decrease in pyruvate production. In erythrocytes containing high levels of methaemoglobin, extracellular NADH increased the rate of methaemoglobin reduction in both the presence and absence of glucose. These results were explained by the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from erythrocytes due to an admittedly low level of haemolysis. This caused the displacement of the intracellular pseudo-equilibrium of the lactate dehydrogenase reaction via transmembrane exchange of lactate, allowing the conversion of extracellular pyruvate to lactate and resulted in an increase in intracellular NADH concentrations. The latter increased the rate of methaemoglobin reduction.  In conclusion, the work described in this thesis showed that erythrocyte membranes do not contain mechanisms for importing electrons or reducing equivalents from extracellular reduced glutathione or NADH. Erythrocytes do, however, contain an electron export system which can reduce extracellular oxidants such as WST-1 and the activity of this system depends on an intricate balance between intracellular antioxidants and enzyme activities. There is much still to be learnt about plasma membrane redox systems, little is known, for example, about the protein composition, mechanism of action, and the in vivo conditions under which these systems are most active.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">NMR;Erythrocytes;NADH;Glutathione;PMOR;Methaemoglobin</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/620</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Amalgamating tribunals: a recipe for optimal reform</field><field name="creator">Bacon, Rachel</field><field name="description">The last decade has seen numerous proposals to reform existing tribunal systems in jurisdictions throughout the common law world.  Across the board, there have been proposals to adopt generalist tribunal models in preference to smaller, specialist tribunal systems, and to achieve these changes through the process of amalgamation.   The most significant recent developments to occur in Australia have taken place in Victoria and NSW during the past five years.  Legislators in these States have chosen to amalgamate a number of smaller, specialist tribunals into larger, generalist bodies.  In 1997 the NSW Parliament passed legislation amalgamating a number of specialist tribunals to create the Administrative Decisions Tribunal (ADT); comparable legislation was passed in Victoria in 1998 to create the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal (VCAT).     There were concurrent attempts to implement similar reforms at federal level.  In 1998 the Commonwealth government announced its intention to amalgamate four Commonwealth merits review tribunals to form one &#65533;super Tribunal&#65533; &#65533; the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART).  The Bills containing these proposals were ultimately defeated in the Senate, however the Australian Government remains convinced of the benefits of amalgamation at federal level.  Similar reforms have been proposed in Western Australia, Tasmania and the United Kingdom. This thesis argues that these reforms are taking place in the absence of data about their likely implications, and without a thorough understanding of the objectives that generalist versus specialist tribunal systems can realistically achieve.  This ill-considered or &#65533;over-hasty&#65533; trend towards amalgamation raises a number of questions which have not previously been addressed in academic or policy-making circles.  An obvious question is whether or not an amalgamated tribunal model is more effective than a series of smaller, specialised tribunals in delivering administrative justice, in other words, whether there is any net gain to be had from a government&#65533;s decision to amalgamate.   The less explored, but equally important, question addressed in this thesis is how the process of amalgamation should be approached in order to realise the maximum potential benefits that an amalgamated tribunal can bring.  That is, to ask what are the ingredients of an optimal amalgamation.  This is not a question about whether government decisions to pursue amalgamation are intrinsically worthwhile or beneficial for stakeholders.  Rather, it is about how government decisions to amalgamate should best be implemented.   This thesis proposes a way of differentiating between good and bad amalgamations, that is grounded in theory and informed by experience to date.  The proposed approach is to assess the effectiveness of amalgamation processes using relevant measures drawn from an analysis of organisational theory literature: &#65533; Legislation &#65533; the legislation establishing an amalgamated tribunal needs to ensure the tribunal will have appropriate independence, powers, processes, membership and structure. &#65533; Political commitment &#65533; those responsible for proposing and planning an amalgamation need to provide appropriate funding and support for the process and for the establishment of an autonomous, self-directed tribunal. &#65533; Organisational structure &#65533; the structures put in place need to be appropriate, integrated and flexible, and should promote cohesion and interaction. &#65533; Process and procedure &#65533; the processes and procedures adopted in an amalgamated tribunal need to capitalise upon the opportunities provided by amalgamation, as well as being appropriate, efficient and able to balance the needs of a range of stakeholders. &#65533; Organisational culture &#65533; an organisational culture which counters natural tendencies towards disjunction will assist members and staff to identify with a newly amalgamated tribunal and to implement initiatives that will improve its performance. &#65533; Leadership &#65533; effective leadership plays an important role in ensuring a smooth transition from specialist to amalgamated tribunal, and engendering commitment from members and staff. Broadly speaking, these factors fall into the four categories of law, context, organisation and people.  It is argued that attention must be paid to all four of these ingredients in order to achieve optimal tribunal reform.  The thesis tests this proposition by examining the three most advanced tribunal amalgamations so far, namely, the Commonwealth ART, the NSW ADT and VCAT in Victoria.   It is argued that the fate of the Commonwealth ART proposal proves the importance of a solid, generally endorsed legislative foundation in creating a viable amalgamated tribunal.   The importance of context, organisation and people is borne out by qualitative research into the amalgamation experiences in NSW and Victoria.  The fact that the NSW and Victorian governments decided to pursue policies of amalgamation at the same time provided a unique opportunity to compare the success or otherwise of two concurrent attempts at amalgamation in different jurisdictions.   This thesis finds that the unfavourable political context in NSW prevented the ADT from realising its potential.  In contrast, the VCAT experience highlights the benefits of paying careful attention to the wide range of factors that can contribute to a successful amalgamation.  Of most relevance are the initial scale of an amalgamation, the political &#65533;will&#65533; behind its implementation, the appointment of a core of full-time members, and the creation of an open institutional culture which facilitates the sharing of information.   In short, the thesis concludes that the successful construction and consolidation of a tribunal post-amalgamation requires that the necessary ingredients of optimal tribunal reform &#65533; legislation, context, organisation and people &#65533; are thoughtfully addressed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">administrative law;administrative tribunals;organisational change;tribunal reform;tribunal amalgamation;super tribunals</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/621</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alkane Oxidation Catalysis by Homogeneous and Heterogeneous Catalyst</field><field name="creator">Guo, Chris</field><field name="description">Abstract  Cobalt-based complexes are widely used in industry and organic synthesis as  catalysts for the oxidation of hydrocarbons. The Co/Mn/Br (known as "CAB system")  catalyst system is effective for the oxidation of toluene. The Co/Mn/Br/Zr catalyst system  is powerful for the oxidation of p-xylene, but not for the oxidation of toluene.  [Co3O(OAc)5(OH)(py)3][PF6] (Co 3+ trimer 5) is more effective than  [Co3O(OAc)6(py)3][PF6] (Co 3+ trimer 6) as a catalyst in the CAB catalyst system. Higher  temperatures favour the oxidation of toluene. Zr 4+ does not enhance the oxidation of  toluene. Zr 4+ could inhibit the oxidation of toluene in the combination of Co/Br/Zr,  Co/Mn/Zr or Co/Zr. NHPI enhances the formation of benzyl alcohol, but the formation of  other by-products is a problem for industrial processes. Complex(es) between cobalt,  manganese and zirconium might be formed during the catalytic reaction. However,  attempts at the preparation of complexes consisting of Co/Zr or Mn/Zr or Co3ZrP or  Co8Zr4 clusters failed.  The oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol is of great  industrial significance. For the homogeneous catalysis at 50 o C and 3 bar N2 pressure, the  activity order is: Mn(OAc)3 &#65533;2H2O &gt; Mn12O12 cluster &gt; Co 3+ trimer 6 &gt;  [Co3O(OAc)3(OH)2(py)5][PF6]2 (Co 3+ trimer 3) &gt; Co 3+ trimer 5 &gt; Co(OAc)2 &#65533;4H2O &gt;  [Co2(OAc)3(OH)2(py)4][PF6]-asym (Co dimerasym) &gt; [Co2(OAc)3(OH)2(py)4][PF6]-sym (Co  dimersym); whereas [Mn2CoO(OAc)6(py)3]&#65533;HOAc (Mn2Co complex) and zirconium(IV)  acetate hydroxide showed almost no activity under these conditions. But at 120 o C and 3  bar N2 pressure, the activity order is changed to: Co dimerasym &gt; Co(OAc)2 &#65533;4H2O &gt; Co  trimer 3 and Mn(OAc)3 &#65533;2H2O &gt; Co 3+ trimer 6 &gt; Mn2Co complex &gt; Co 3+ trimer 5 &gt; Co  dimersym &gt; Mn12O12 cluster. The molar ratio of the products was close to  cyclohexanol/cyclohexanone=2/1. Mn(II) acetate and zirconium(IV) acetate hydroxide  showed almost no activity under these conditions. Among those cobalt dimers and  trimers, only the cobalt dimerasym survived after the stability tests, this means that  [Co2(OAc)3(OH)2(py)4][PF6]-asym might be the active form for cobalt(II) acetate in the  CAB system.  Metal-substituted (silico)aluminophosphate-5 molecular sieves (MeAPO-5 and  MeSAPO-5) are important heterogeneous catalysts for the oxidation of cyclohexane. The  preparation of MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 and their catalytic activities were studied. Pure  MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 are obtained and characterised. Four new pairs of bimetal-substituted  MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5(CoZr, MnZr, CrZr and MnCo) were prepared  successfully. Two novel trimetal-subtituted MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 (MnCoZr) are  reported here. Improved methods for the preparation of four monometal-substituted  MeAPO-5 (Cr, Co, Mn and Zr) and for CoCe(S)APO-5 and CrCe(S)APO-5 are reported.  Novel combinational mixing conditions for the formation of gel mixtures for Me(S)APO-5  syntheses have been developed.  For the oxidation of cyclohexane by TBHP catalysed by MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5  materials, CrZrSAPO-5 is the only active MeSAPO-5 catalyst among those materials  tested under conditions of refluxing in cyclohexane. Of the MeAPO-5 materials tested,  whereas CrCeSAPO-5 has very little activity, CrZrAPO-5 and CrCeAPO-5 are very  active catalysts under conditions of refluxing in cyclohexane. MnCoAPO-5, MnZrAPO-5  and CrAPO-5 are also active. When Cr is in the catalyst system, the product distribution  is always cyclohexanone/cyclohexanol equals 2-3)/1, compared with 1/2 for other catalysts.  For MeAPO-5, the activity at 150 o C and 10 bar N2 pressure is: CrZrAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5  &gt; CoZrAPO-5. For MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5, at 150 o C and 13 bar N2 pressure, the  selectivity towards cyclohexanone is: CrZrAPO-5 &gt; CrZrSAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5 &gt;  CrAPO-5 &gt; MnCoAPO-5 &gt; MnZrAPO-5; and the selectivity towards cyclohexanol is:  MnZrAPO-5 &gt; CrZrAPO-5 &gt; MnCoAPO-5 &gt; CrZrSAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5 &gt; CrAPO-5.  Overall the selectivity towards the oxidation of cyclohexane is: CrZrAPO-5 &gt;  CrZrSAPO-5 &gt; CrCeAPO-5 &gt; CrAPO-5 &gt; MnCoAPO-5 &gt; MnZrAPO-5. The amount of  water in the system can affect the performance of CrCeAPO-5, but has almost no effect  on CrZrAPO-5. Metal leaching is another concern in potential industrial applications of  MeAPO-5 and MeSAPO-5 catalysts. The heterogeneous catalysts prepared in the present  work showed very little metal leaching. This feature, coupled with the good selectivities  and effectivities, makes them potentially very useful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alkane Oxidation;Catalysis;Homogeneous;Heterogeneous;Catalyst</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unenlightened efficiency: the administration of the juvenile correction system in New South Wales 1905-1988</field><field name="creator">Quinn, Peter Erwin</field><field name="description">This work traces the history of the juvenile correction system in twentieth century New South Wales, focusing on the evolution of major reforms aimed at curbing delinquency.   The study begins in 1905 with the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act.      It concludes in 1988, when another set of significant reforms, designed to deal with perceived inadequacies of the established system, commenced.    The main focus of the thesis is the government system of corrections.   Although there was an active non - government correction system, this sector was increasingly absorbed by the larger public sphere.  The principal argument is that, although there were sporadic periods during which changes to the system were made, its progress through most of the twentieth century was characterised by an underlying attitude which regarded the boys and girls it dealt with, particularly those committed to institutions, as belonging to an inferior, delinquent class.   As such, they were treated as the progeny of a criminal class destined for the most part to remain part of that class.    This idea of a delinquent class coloured all aspects of the way juveniles were treated, specifically lack of resources, the dominance of economic considerations over the welfare of children, excessive regimentation, harsh discipline and illegal punishments.    When management problems arose they were met with increased coercion.    Although lip-service was paid to the ideal of child saving, reality did not match the rhetoric.   Programs which ostensibly were meant to individualise treatment so that it was tailored to suit each child, were carried out perfunctorily. Periodic and well-meaning efforts at reform were stifled by bureaucratic inertia, political considerations, and the entrenched belief that incarceration was preferable to treatment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">juvenile correction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/623</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ELECTROCOAGULATION: UNRAVELLING AND SYNTHESISING THE MECHANISMS BEHIND A WATER TREATMENT PROCESS</field><field name="creator">Holt, Peter Kevin</field><field name="description">Electrocoagulation is an empirical (and largely heuristic) water treatment technology that has had many different applications over the last century. It has proven its viability by removing a wide range of pollutants. The approach to reactor design has been haphazard, however, with little or no reference to previous designs or underlying principles. This thesis reviewed these reactor designs, identifying key commonalities and synthesising a new design hierarchy, summarised by three main decisions:  1. Batch or continuous operation;  2. Coagulation only or coagulation plus flotation reactors, and;  3. Associated separation process if required.  This design decision hierarchy thereby provides a consistent basis for future electrocoagulation reactor designs.    Electrochemistry, coagulation, and flotation are identified as the key foundation sciences for electrocoagulation, and the relevant mechanisms (and their interactions) are extracted and applied in an electrocoagulation context.     This innovative approach was applied to a 7 L batch electrocoagulation reactor treating clay-polluted water. Structured macroscopic experiments identified current (density), time, and mixing as the key operating parameters for electrocoagulation. A dynamic mass balance was conducted over the batch reactor, for the first time, thereby enabling the extraction of a concentration profile. For this batch system, three operating stages were then identifiable: lag, reactive, and stable stages. Each stage was systematically investigated (in contrast to the previous ad hoc approach) with reference to each of the foundation sciences and the key parameters of current and time.     Electrochemical behaviour characterised both coagulant and bubble generation. Polarisation experiments were used to determine the rate-limiting step at each electrode&#65533;s surface. Consequently the appropriate Tafel parameters were extracted and hence the cell potential. At low currents both electrodes (anode and cathode) operated in the charge-transfer region. As the current increased, the mechanism shifted towards the diffusion-limited region, which increased the required potential. Polarisation experiments also define the operating potential at each electrode thereby enabling aluminium&#65533;s dissolution behaviour to be thermodynamically characterised on potential-pH (Pourbaix) diagrams. Active and passive regions were defined and hence the aluminium&#65533;s behaviour in an aqueous environment can now be predicted for electrocoagulation.     Novel and detailed solution chemistry modelling of the metastable and stable aluminium species revealed the importance of oligomer formation and their rates in electrocoagulation. In particular, formation of the positively trimeric aluminium species increased solution pH (to pH 10.6), beyond the experimentally observed operable pH of 9. Thereby signifying the importance of the formation kinetics to the trimer as the active coagulant specie in electrocoagulation.    Further leading insights to the changing coagulation mechanism in electrocoagulation were possible by comparison and contrast with the conventional coagulation method of alum dosing. Initially in the lag stage, little aggregation is observed until the coagulant concentration reaches a critical level. Simultaneously, the measured zeta potential increases with coagulant addition and the isoelectric point is attained in the reactive stage. Here a sorption coagulation mechanism is postulated; probably charge neutralisation, that quickly aggregates pollutant particles forming open structured aggregates as indicated by the low fractal dimension.       As time progresses, pollutant concentration decreases and aluminium addition continues hence aluminium hydroxide/oxide precipitates. The bubbles gently sweep the precipitate through the solution, resulting in coagulation by an enmeshment mechanism (sweep coagulation). Consequently compact aggregates are formed, indicating by the high fractal dimension.     Flotation is an inherent aspect of the batch electrocoagulation reactor via the production of electrolytic gases. In the reactor, pollutant separation occurs in situ, either by flotation or settling. From the concentration profiles extracted, original kinetic expressions were formulated to quantify these competing removal processes. As current increases, both settling and flotation rate constants increased due to the additional coagulant generation. This faster removal was offset by a decrease in the coagulant efficiency. Consequently a trade-off exists between removal time and coagulant efficiency that can be evaluated economically.     A conceptual framework of electrocoagulation is developed from the synthesis of the systematic study to enable a priori prediction. This framework creates predictability for electrocoagulation, which is innovative and original for the technology. Predictability provides insights to knowledge transfer (between batch and continuous), efficient coagulant and separation path, to name just a few examples. This predictability demystifies electrocoagulation by providing a powerful design tool for the future development of scaleable, industrial electrocoagulation water treatment design and operation process.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">water;electrocoagulation. mechanisms;water treatment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic effect of Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist in Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae challenged pigs</field><field name="creator">Khan, Shamila</field><field name="description">Immunological stressors, in the form of clinical and sub-clinical disease are currently controlled using both prophylactic antibiotics in-feed, and therapeutic antibiotic treatment. Respiratory disease, primarily Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (App) infection, is recognised as a major factor causing reduced productivity in pigs. This thesis reports investigations into the use of novel immunomodulators in particular Interleukin 4 (IL-4) and Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) as alternatives to antibiotics to treat App infection. Immunological and molecular biological assays were used to investigate and accumulate data. An in vitro study undertaken to find potential anti-inflammatory substances, revealed that Interleukin 8 (IL-8) mRNA production stimulated by PMA or LPS in whole pigs' blood was suppressed by IL-4. IL-1ra also suppressed stimulated IL-8 mRNA production by heat killed App bacteria (KB) in vitro. An acute LPS challenge in pigs in vivo however, showed no variation in illness or weight loss between pigs treated prophylactically with anti-inflammatory substance (IL-4 and IL-1ra) and saline treated pigs. The use of plasmids as a delivery system for anti-inflammatory substance did not show promise since it did not enhance growth or prolong the expression of the substances in the pigs. However, in the chronic App challenge model IL-4 and IL-1ra administered prophylactically in vivo showed an ability to improve growth. The therapeutic administration of IL-4 and IL-1ra to App challenged pigs showed no difference in pigs' growth, regardless of the treatment or control administered. To conclude, IL-4 and IL-1ra showed promise when administered prophylactically and improved growth and abrogated disease under conditions of App challenge. However when IL-4 and IL-1ra where administered therapeutically they did not perform as well. Moreover these compounds have potential as a commercial application to reduce the growth reduction caused by disease such as App.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pig;Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae;Interleukin-4;Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist;IL-1ra;IL-4;porcine</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The SWHEL model for studying B cell responses in tolerance and immunity</field><field name="creator">Phan, Tri Giang</field><field name="description">Classical immunoglobulin transgenic (Ig-Tg) mouse models such as the MD4 anti-hen egg lysozyme (-HEL) Ig-Tg line have been used extensively to study B cell responses in tolerance and immunity. This thesis describes a new generation of gene-targeted mice (designated SWHEL mice) whereby the VH10 Ig variable gene encoding the HyHEL-10 specificity of the original anti-HEL Ig-Tg mouse was targeted to the Ig heavy chain locus. B cells in the SWHEL mouse are therefore capable of undergoing class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM), representing a major advance on the original MD4 mouse model. SWHEL mice were found to not only contain a large population of HEL-specific (HEL+) B cells but also a significant population of non-HEL-binding (HEL-) B cells generated by VH gene replacement. HEL+ SWHEL B cells were found to belong to the B2 lineage and displayed high levels of surface IgM. Nevertheless, they matured normally and colonised the primary B cell follicle and marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen. The SWHEL model thus provided an opportunity to re-examine some of the original observations made in the MD4 system and also to extend these observations, particularly with regard to the regulation of CSR by self-reactive B cells. As expected, analysis of SWHEL B cells exposed to high avidity membrane-bound HEL revealed that they underwent clonal deletion in the bone marrow (BM). More interestingly, analysis of HEL+ B cells exposed to low avidity soluble HEL revealed that they were able to emigrate from the BM to the spleen as anergic B cells. However, unlike anergic MD4 B cells, anergic SWHEL B cells were reduced in frequency, displayed an immature B cell phenotype, were excluded from the follicle and had a reduced lifespan. Direct measurement of B cell antigen receptor (BCR) occupancy by HEL and the frequency of HEL- competitor B cells was combined with mixed BM irradiation chimeras to demonstrate unequivocally that the difference in phenotype and fate of HEL+ B cells in the two systems was due solely to competition from HEL- B cells. In addition, the SWHEL model of B cell self-tolerance was used to show that while self-reactive B cells were hypo-responsive to BCR stimulation, BCR-independent signals delivered via anti-CD40 plus IL-4 or lipopolysaccharide could trigger them to undergo CSR and secretion of potentially pathogenic isotype-switched autoantibodies. Finally, the SWHEL model was used to study the responses of adoptively transferred follicular (Fo) and MZ B cells to in vivo activation with HEL conjugated to sheep red blood cells (HEL-SRBC). These studies revealed that both HEL+ MZ and Fo B cells were capable of mounting a robust T cell-dependent IgG1 antibody response to HEL-SRBC. However, HEL+ MZ B cells did not efficiently localise to the T cell-B cell border following antigen engagement and preferentially migrated to the bridging channels and red pulp. In contrast, HEL+ Fo B cells rapidly localised to the T cell-B cell border and subsequently colonised numerous germinal centres. As a result, the rate and pattern of SHM by HEL+ Fo and MZ B cells was shown to be distinct, with preferential targeting of mutations to the second complementarity-determining region in the former and to the second framework region in the latter. Together these data indicate illustrate the value of the SWHEL model and its potential to greatly advance the current understanding of B cell responses in tolerance and immunity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">B cells;self-tolerance;T-dependent;antibodies;marginal zone</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/626</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Popular Mythology and Popular Culture in Post-war America, as represented by four novels - The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, by John Barth, White Noise, by Don DeLillo, and Vineland, by Thomas Pynchon.</field><field name="creator">Reed, Mark Dobson</field><field name="description">The four novels - The Floating Opera, The End of the Road, White Noise, and  Vineland - are representative of the cultural shift away from traditional moral  concepts after World War II. Popular culture has increasingly become the guiding  force for the continuation of American society, and in Don DeLillo&#65533;s White Noise,  popular culture and its creation of myth (according to the author&#65533;s representation of  America) has become embedded in the system and life of contemporary America.  John Barth&#65533;s novel The End of the Road and its predecessor The Floating  Opera are important in any discussion of the role of popular culture and popular  mythology in post-war America. They both appear to signal an end to sincere  intellectual thought or debate, and the notion of imposing a rational moral world upon  the social landscape surrounding the individual. The Floating Opera explores the  common tendency of society to avoid difficult intellectual struggles, and the central  character and first-person narrator ultimately realises that questions about the nature  of existence are of no objective value. In The End of the Road the character Jacob  Horner adopts a superficial reflection of pre-existing rules and social conventions.  Together these novels reflect much of what is at present understood as the postmodern  aesthetic, and are indicative of many of the changes in America that were  about to occur. The Floating Opera was published in 1956 and The End of the Road  was published in 1958, but they are still highly relevant beyond the period in which  they were written.    White Noise (1984) portrays a system founded on the Hollywood mythology,  and the superficial reflection of pre-existing rules and social conventions found in The  End of the Road. The novel revolves around the experiences of the narrator, Jack  Gladney, a university lecturer who teaches Hitler studies at Blacksmith College, and  his wife Babette. The course which he teaches on Hitler is influenced by Hollywood  myth, and the novel portrays a consumer-based society that has lost much of the firm  moral basis which traditional religious concepts formerly supplied. The role of  television, Hollywood, and the idea of simulation are all explored throughout the  novel and are important forces in any examination of post-war American society.  Finally, in Vineland (1990) the social upheavals which occurred during the  late &#65533;60s and early &#65533;70s are explored from the perspective of the 1980s. The novel  refers to a vast array of images and icons from popular culture, and the brief youth  rebellion, in the late &#65533;60s, which failed to inspire any final social revolution. The  result of this failed social revolution is a landscape of popular culture in modern  America, where Godzilla leaves footprints in Japan and popular mythology from  television or pulp novels coincides with everyday life. There are references in typical  Pynchonesque fashion to those who must necessarily be orchestrating these social and  cultural alterations, but they, as specific individuals, remain anonymous or hidden  from the scope of the author (although, as in White Noise, there are deliberate  references to the CIA and other agencies or departments within the U.S. Federal  Government). Vineland is important, therefore, both as an account of the social  changes which occurred in America between the late &#65533;60s and &#65533;80s, and the increasing  role of popular culture in America.

This makes it potentially useful as a gene therapy vector to target neuronal cells. HSV-1 enters cells by membrane fusion, the viral envelope and most tegument proteins dissociate, and the capsid is transported to the cell nucleus to establish infection. There is increasing evidence that the retrograde transport of HSV-1 along sensory axons is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, but the viral and cellular proteins involved are not known. Cytoplasmic dynein is the major molecular motor involved in minus-end-directed cellular transport along microtubules. It is a large complex molecule, with heavy chains providing motility, while intermediate and light chains are involved in specific cargo binding.  A library of HSV-1 capsid and tegument structural genes was constructed and tested for interaction with dynein subunits in a yeast two-hybrid system. A strong interaction was demonstrated between the HSV-1 outer capsid protein VP26 (UL35), as well as the tegument protein VP11/12 (UL46), with the homologous 14 kDa dynein light chains rp3 and Tctex1. In vitro pull-down assays confirmed binding of VP26 to rp3, Tctex1 and cytoplasmic dynein complexes. Recombinant HSV-1 capsids +/- VP26 were used in similar pull-down assays. Only VP26+ capsids bound to rp3. Recombinant HSV-1 capsids were microinjected into living cells and incubated at 37&#65533;C. After 1 h capsids were observed to co-localise with rp3, Tctex1 and microtubules. After 2 or 4 h VP26+ capsids had moved closer to the cell nucleus, while VP26- capsids remained in a random distribution.   Our results suggest that the HSV-1 outer capsid protein VP26 mediates binding of incoming capsids to the retrograde motor cytoplasmic dynein during cellular infection, through interactions with dynein light chains. It is hoped that these findings will help in the development of a synthetic viral vector, which may allow targeted gene therapy in patients with neurological diseases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">herpes simplex virus;dynein;molecular motors;axonal transport;viral proteins;microinjection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/628</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimising the Postharvest Management Of Lychee (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) &#65533; A Study of Mechanical Injury and Desiccation</field><field name="creator">Bryant, Philippa</field><field name="description">The major objective of the research was to improve lychee postharvest management, through a greater understanding of mechanical injury and moisture loss.   Mechanical injury is a known cause of postharvest loss in lychee, but previously published information has been limited to broad observations. In this study, the symptoms of mechanical damage in lychee were defined, including quantitative measurement of colour changes. Impact injury caused protuberance tip darkening, cracking of the pericarp and significant changes in skin colour. Compression also typically caused tip darkening, and severe loads were capable of puncture, shape distortion and skin cracking. Abrasion and vibration injuries were characterised by strong yellowing of pericarp colour, possibly due to the leakage of cell contents onto the fruit surface. Vibration also caused significant darkening and loss of colour saturation. Vibration has not previously been mentioned as an issue in lychee postharvest management, but appeared to be as important a problem as desiccation browning at the wholesale level, both in incidence and severity.   Mechanically damaged fruit consistently showed increased ethylene and carbon dioxide synthesis, and moisture loss was increased by up to 30%. Some significant changes in skin biochemistry and cuticle properties were also detected. The study of damaged tissue by SEM revealed distinctive patterns of surface tissue disruption. Open pericarp cracking was a particularly detrimental injury, causing significantly increased electrolyte leakage and rapid pathogen development.  The effects of load characteristics, such as magnitude, method of application, site, repetition and cushioning, on the extent of damage were defined. Fruit  characteristics such as cultivar, gross morphology, temperature, hydration and surface wetness were shown to significantly affect damage levels. Small seed size was correlated with increased cracking susceptibility. Fruit surface wetness exacerbated vibration or abrasion damage. Turgid fruit were less susceptible to vibration and abrasion damage, but showed increased susceptibility to impact cracking.    Previously neglected aspects of desiccation browning research were studied, including cultivar and maturity effects, sites of moisture loss and the role of air currents. Cultivar effects on moisture loss were obscured by pre-harvest factors, but consistent cultivar differences were detected in desiccation browning, possibly related to skin thickness. In contrast, maturity levels over a marketable range had little effect on weight loss or browning. Moisture was lost fairly evenly over the fruit surface, but poor postharvest handling appeared to massively increase loss from the protuberance tips. Moisture loss was shown to substantially increase ethylene synthesis. The crucial role of air currents in exacerbating lychee moisture loss was emphasised, and the relationship between air speed and weight loss was defined.  The research contributed to a greater understanding of the processes of mechanical damage and moisture loss in lychee, leading to improved protocols for the postharvest management of the fruit. Improved management of mechanical damage and moisture loss will ultimately improve fruit quality and reduce postharvest losses, hence increasing returns to industry.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lychee;Litchi;Mechanical;Injury;Damage;Desiccation;Moisture Loss;Water Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remobilisation of Heavy Metals from Sediments Using Aminopolycarboxylic Acids</field><field name="creator">Fang, Bin</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a study of the remobilisation of heavy metals from sediments by three aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCAs). They are nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid. The investigation is introduced by examining the sources, uses and chemistry of these acids. The introduction also includes a discussion of what is known about the inclusion of heavy metals into sediments and their remobilisation from sediments. Typical concentrations of APCAs in natural waters and sediments have been catalogued from the literature. The advantages and disadvantages of various laboratory techniques employed for the remobilisation of heavy metals by APCAs from sediments are assessed, as is the use of such experiments in quantifying the role of APCAs in the remobilisation of heavy metals from sediments. Sediments from three areas were sampled for this study; they were the Alexandra Canal, Captains Flat and Jenolan Caves in New South Wales, Australia. In each area several sites were sampled. For each site there is a brief description of the catchment geology and hydrology. Selected sediment-associated waters in the areas were analysed for their metal concentrations as well as for ultratrace levels of APCAs employing a method developed in the present study. The waters were analysed for the major ions Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, NO3- and SO42-. The sediments from selected sites in each of the areas were dried and fractionated. The dry total and fine sediments were analysed for their metal content and the latter was found to adequately represent the former in this respect. Water samples from the three areas showed different chemistries and exhibited more subtle differences between sites. In general, the Alexandra Canal waters are saline and alkaline and are a mixture of urban runoff and seawater; the Captains Flat waters are acidic and contain high sulfate from acid mine and tailings drainage; the Jenolan Caves waters are neutral and have the features characteristic of waters draining through limestone. The APCA contamination in all water samples when ranked against other global sites is very low. Although the current APCA levels in the waters appear low, it was concluded that they should be closely monitored so that efforts can be made to minimise the risk of APCAs being hazardous environmental contaminants and also that any remobilisation of heavy metals from sediments by APCAs can be controlled. Agitation and column laboratory-scale experiments were carried out in order to obtain an understanding of the remobilisation of metals by contamination levels of APCAs in water, both as the individual APCAs and as a mixture of APCAs. Complimentary experiments were carried out using a molar excess of APCAs calculated from the metal concentrations obtained by acid digestion (assuming 1:1 metal complex formation). Both types of remobilisation experiments were designed to investigate the role that redox potential (Eh) and concentration of APCAs in natural waters have on the remobilisation of heavy metals from the sediments. The agitation experiments were employed to assess metal remobilisation for the situation where the sediments are disturbed while the column experiments explored metal remobilisation for the case where the sediments are left undisturbed in situ. The major conclusions from the agitation experiments that used fine sediment from the Alexandra Canal were that 100 ppm APCA solutions will remobilise metals from the sediments under oxic conditions but only remobilise infinitesimally small amounts of metal under anoxic conditions. The use of fine sediments for the duplicate agitation experiments was found to give adequate duplication of results. A mixture of APCAs in solution acts similarly to the average of the three individual APCA solutions, showing that there are no antagonistic or synergistic effects likely to occur when they are found together in the environment. It was found that the mmoles of the metals remobilised exceeded the mmoles of the APCAs added when 500.0 mL of 100 ppm APCA solution was used on 50.00 g of sediment. This might be due to APCAs remobilising metals from the sediments in ways other than by complexation. Even though an excess of APCAs was available, metal remobilisation was not complete when the experiments were forced to terminate. During the 14 days of the experiment, only one quarter of the metals liberated from the sediment by HNO3 and 30 % H2O2 digestion were remobilised by the APCAs. Therefore an excess of free APCAs remains in solution. Fine sediments from Alexandra Canal, Captains Flat and Jenolan Caves were employed in the oxic agitation experiments using excess APCAs in solution. These experiments resulted in the following major conclusion: when producing an APCA remobilisation signature for trace and ultratrace metals, the geochemistry of the site is of secondary importance to the source of the contaminating metals. This is a feature of the trace and ultratrace metal speciation in the source rather than their concentration in it. From the different levels of calcium present in the three areas it was found that calcium is unlikely to form stable 1:1 APCA complexes at the pH values employed and is unlikely to compete with the heavy metal remobilisation by APCAs. Total sediments from Alexandra Canal and 100 ppm APCA solutions were employed for the column leaching experiments. From mass, pore water volumes and flow measurements it was shown that the ten mini cores taken from the same site were not true replicates. Despite this, when the sediments have settled and the pore waters removed from the cores, the levels of metal being leached stabilise and may represent a clearer picture of the in situ metal leaching from sediment with time. The levels of metal leached from the cores in 14 days suggest that during this period the cores are essentially anoxic, with the oxygen supplied from the oxic leaching solutions used for inorganic and microbial processes in the sediments. Agitation experiments appeared to yield an adequate picture of what would happen if free APCA solution came in contact with fine sediments suspended in the water column. Column leaching experiments employing total sediment were found to be only of limited value in assessing heavy metal remobilisation from undisturbed sediment. These experiments do not give a reliable assessment of the bioavailability of heavy metals and further testing of the acute and chronic toxicity of the sediments is recommended. APCA solutions that have been used in sediment and soil washing under conditions related to those used in the present study may contain an excess of the free APCAs as well as APCA heavy metal complexes and hence may be toxic to biota.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aminopolycarboxylic acids (APCA);nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA);ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA);diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leo Strauss's Recovery of the Political: The City and Man as a reply to Carl Schmitt's The Concept of the Political</field><field name="creator">Dutton, Brett</field><field name="description">This dissertation demonstrates that Leo Strauss, in The City and Man, continues his response to Carl Schmitt&#65533;s arguments concerning the affirmation of the political, as outlined by Strauss in his 1932 article on Schmitt&#65533;s The Concept of the Political.  In affirming the political, Strauss spoke of the 'theologico-political problem', or the question regarding who, or what, should rule society.  Strauss outlines six criteria in his 1932 'Comments', which he argues can be found in Schmitt&#65533;s The Concept of the Political, as essential for the recovery of the political.  In raising the question of the political, both Schmitt and Strauss return to the fundamental question regarding how one should live.  In so doing, Strauss rejects Schmitt&#65533;s reliance on conflicting faiths and returns to the Socratic description of the best regime (politeia), understood as the best way of life, that is devoted to contemplation, peace and justice.  In his argument in The City and Man, Strauss satisfies the six criteria outlined in his 'Comments': (1) the acceptance of moral evil within human nature; (2) the problem of opposition among groups; (3) the possibility of a non-neutral, transprivate obligation; (4) the need for a content that determines the distinction between friend and enemy; (5) a content that leads to a quarrel over the question of 'what is Right?' and (6) that the political must address 'the order of human things from a pure and whole knowledge'.  This thesis demonstrates that Strauss&#65533;s 1964 book, The City and Man, indirectly addresses Schmitt&#65533;s general criteria, using an interpretation of Thucydides&#65533;s, Aristotle&#65533;s and Plato&#65533;s best regime &#65533; which is linked to the pursuit of wisdom, or the philosophic life &#65533; to provide a transpolitical standard that opposes Schmitt&#65533;s insistence on 'concrete' experience, that relies on historical destiny, and faith, as the guide to political life.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">political theory;schmitt;strauss;politics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Banking on the Customer': customer relations, employment relations and worker identity in the Australian retail banking industry</field><field name="creator">Cutcher, Leanne Rose</field><field name="description">Previously consigned to the anonymity of &#65533;the product market&#65533; by  researchers in traditional fields such as labour economics and industrial relations, the customer has recently attracted the attention of scholars from a diverse range of disciplines, including organisational behaviour, work psychology, labour process studies, gender studies, and critical management studies. In large part, this emerging interest in the customer is a result of the increasing dominance of service industries in developed economies and the recognition that service work entails a complex, three-way interaction between customers, management and workers.  The literature identifies a range of competing and, at times, contradictory images of the customer.  Rather than seeking to reconcile these competing representations, this thesis explores the multi-faceted nature of the customer presence and the implications for managers and workers in the retail banking industry in Australia.  The thesis highlights how structural change and shifting discourses of the &#65533;customer&#65533; have influenced customer relations, employment relations, and worker identity in three areas of the retail banking industry: traditional retail banks, the credit union movement, and community banks. Drawing on detailed qualitative case study evidence, the thesis highlights the range of customers, both &#65533;real&#65533; and &#65533;constructed&#65533;, that can be found in the case study organisations.  The thesis identifies the ways in which customers influence employment relations and how workers can be active in either accommodating or resisting the impact of these &#65533;customers&#65533; on workplace practice and worker identity.  The central argument of the thesis is that, in addition to customers having a physical presence in and influence on organisational life, management and workers also construct &#65533;discursive customers&#65533; as a means of influencing the employment relationship and the meanings attached to service work. The study examines how these competing concepts of the customer and customer service influence both the customer-service provider relationship and service workers&#65533; relationships with one another and with management. Despite the increasing recognition that service work entails a three-way relationship between customers, management and workers, our understanding of how workers either welcome or resist the presence of this third actor in the employment relationship has, until recently remained very  limited.  This thesis makes a significant contribution to our understanding that for workers the customer is ever-present physically, emotionally and discursively.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">customer service;identity;discourse;change resistance;human resource manaagement;industrial relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vietnamese Aesthetics From 1925 Onwards</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Boi Tran</field><field name="description">Twentieth century art in Vi&#234;t-Nam underwent immense changes due to the nation&#65533;s  encounters with the West, through colonialism and two great wars. This thesis  examines the significant impact of architecture, clothing painting and sculpture on the  development of Vietnamese aesthetics. The very public nature of architecture and  clothing will be used as a cultural backdrop for the changing aesthetic ideals in  painting and sculpture.  The thesis examines the aesthetic merits of Socialist Realism, introduced after  reunification in 1975, in particular, its relationship to the art of the Republic of Vie&#65533;t-  Nam (South Vi&#234;t-Nam) from 1954 to 1975. Vietnamese post-war art historians have  consistently omitted the significant cultural developments of this period in their  writings. A study of this distinctive era will clarify aesthetic changes in the last decades  of the twentieth century.  After a long period of isolation and ideological constraint, remarkable cultural changes  occurred when Vi&#234;t-Nam re-established contact with the outside world. This thesis will  present the subsequent changes in aesthetics, as an attempt to balance tradition and  modernity, within the context of market reforms and the internationalisation of  Vietnamese art. These events had a significant impact on the contemporary art market  in Vi&#234;t-Nam.  Through the changes that art history has noted, this thesis argues that the interactions  with outsiders were either an impetus or a pressure for changes in Vie&#65533;t-Nam&#65533;s drive  for modernity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnamese aesthetics;Arts;Paintings;Sculpture</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Recovery of Resources: a Case Study of Wood Waste in the Greater Sydney Region</field><field name="creator">Warnken, Matthew</field><field name="description">In present day society there is an artificial dichotomy between wastes and resources that is perhaps best summed up by the Western Sydney Waste Board slogan 'there is no such thing as waste &#65533; only resources in the wrong place and at the wrong time'.  Waste management was originally driven by managing the health consequences of wrong time/place materials.  This has changed and the significant driver is now the sustainable utilisation of resources, that is, trying to optimally recover as resources (right time/place) those materials that present as wastes requiring management. However, it is not acceptable to justify a resource recovery option purely on the basis that it is diverting material away from landfill.  Preferences are emerging for recovery activities that maximise the resource value of a material according to techno-economic, environmental and socio-political criteria; collectively known as the criteria of sustainability.  The people and organisations articulating these preferences include owners/operators of resource recovery centres, proponents of alternative waste management technologies, waste planners and managers at both a state and local government level and environmental NGOs representing community interests, in addition to the generators of waste at a domestic, commercial and industrial, and construction and demolition level.  It is therefore important to be able to answer the question of 'what is the optimal or most sustainable resource recovery option for materials presenting as waste to landfill in the Greater Sydney Region?' The point of departure for this thesis is twofold.  Firstly, that optimal resource recovery options (also known as alternative waste management technologies) can be identified by understanding the context and system drivers and constraints within the system of waste generation and utilisation, by modelling the system using industrial ecology (specifically Materials Flux Analysis) and by using the technology assessment framework developed by the NSW Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry to evaluate the available options. Secondly, that should the assessment framework from the NSW Inquiry prove to be unsuitable as a framework for evaluation, then an improved and refined assessment framework can be constructed in order to identify optimal resource recovery options and that this process can be successfully demonstrated using wood waste as a case study. The context of waste as an issue has shifted from local government control (pre-1970s) to state government control through the Department of Environment and Conservation.  This transition followed experiments with organisations such as the NSW Waste Boards and Resource NSW, in addition to state targets such as a 60% reduction of waste to landfill by the year 2000. In addition to this backdrop of change from a government administrative perspective, there are also a suite of often conflicting drivers and constraints influencing the process of resource recovery.  For example, sustainable development is a public policy driver for the integration of environmental and societal concerns, but can also constrain new innovation if competing 'status quo' utilisation options are not subject to the same scrutiny.   Similarly, legislation acts as a constraint to resource recovery options by establishing license conditions, prohibiting some energy recovery options and setting recovery criteria; however legislation also acts as a driver for resource recovery options that generate renewable electricity or act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Other drivers and constraints include social, technical and economic issues and concerns in addition to environmental impacts such as emissions to air, land and water.  Industrial ecology is a model for viewing system components as part of a dependent and interrelated greater whole.  Within the context of Industrial Ecology, waste is a by-product of manufacture available as a beneficial input into other processes.  Using Materials Flux Analysis as a tool to build a model of waste generation and utilisation, elements within the system are presented as a series of stocks (sources), technology interventions (transformation flows) and sinks (markets). The stocks or sources of materials for resource recovery are categorised as Municipal Solid (MSW), Commercial and Industrial (C&amp;I) or Construction and Demolition (C&amp;D) wastes.  Approximately seven million tonnes of waste is generated in the Greater Sydney Region (nearly two and a half million tonnes of materials recovered for recycling and four and a half million tonnes of materials disposed of  to landfill).   The purpose of technology intervention is to transform the material into a product that is suited to the end market (sink).  Markets are grouped according to reuse (same function and form), direct recycling (same supply chain), indirect recycling (different supply chain) and energy recovery (either as process heat, electricity or co-generation, a combination of the two).  Landfill is also a potential sink for materials and in this sense can be thought of as a negative value market.   The Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry provided an assessment framework for resource recovery technologies.  Each technology was measured and compared against 16 evaluation criteria, resulting in a score out of one hundred.  Material sorting scored the highest (81.5), incineration the lowest (50.8) with most of the biological technologies performing &#65533;well&#65533; (64.6 &#65533; 71.7) and with the landfill technologies performing 'moderately well' (60.4 - 61.4). The positive features of the Inquiry included the overview of alternative resource recovery technologies, waste generation and other issues pertinent to decision making and resource recovery.  The negatives of the Inquiry arise from the inadequacies of the assessment framework, which lacked technology options, system boundary definition and requisite evaluation criteria in addition to inconsistencies in scoring approaches.  By undertaking a sensitivity analysis on the Inquiry&#65533;s results, it is shown that rank order reversal results from the allocation of weightings. The improved and refined assessment framework, constructed to overcome identified inadequacies of the Inquiry&#65533;s approach, focussed on clearly identifying the problem to be addressed and the primary decision maker involved in the process; ensuring that appropriate options for evaluation were included; defining the system boundary for the assessment; selecting necessary evaluation criteria; adopting a more sophisticated system for scoring; and using a sensitivity analysis to validate the results of the resource recovery option evaluation. Wood waste was used as a case study for this second assessment methodology.  Wood waste refers to the end-of-life products, failed products, offcuts, shavings and sawdust from all timber products.  Approximately 350,000 tonnes of wood waste are disposed of to landfill each year.  This comprises untreated timber (hard wood and soft wood), engineered timber products (particleboard, medium density fibreboard and plywood) and treated timber (predominately copper chrome arsenic). Eight wood resource recovery options are selected for evaluation within the Greater Sydney Region with a different approach to scoring that has the advantage of 'scaling up' the best performers within each attribute (highest score) while 'scaling down' the worst performers (no score).  Under this evaluation, an on-site purpose built energy facility is the most preferred option with particleboard manufacture the least preferred option. A sensitivity analysis of the results reveals that the scores of each technology option are sensitive to the weightings of the decision maker. When the change in rankings is examined, it is identified that two eight wood recovery options undergo a large rank reversal. A critique of the results of the wood evaluation reveals five major flaws.  Firstly the evaluation produces non-highest resource value results that are non-intuitive (and arguably misleading), for example the poor performance of reuse and particleboard against energy generation options.  Secondly, the recording of a single summary score for each recovery option hides unacceptable performance levels in some criteria.  For example, the top scorer of Primary Energy On-site hides the fact that such an option is likely to have no political desirability (likely public opposition to 'incineration' within the Sydney air-shed), calling into question its ability to be implemented as a solution.  Thirdly there is a reliance on judgement for the scoring of options and weighting of preferences, calling into doubt the accuracy of scores.   Fourthly, the rankings of recovery options by the assessment framework are sensitive to the allocation of weightings.   Finally and most importantly, the refined evaluation approach suffers from the 'discrete option syndrome', the scoring of each recovery option in isolation with no ability to look at integrated systems with joint recovery options.  This is pinpointed as a fundamental flaw in the process of both the Inquiry and the wood evaluation.   This leads to the conclusion that the founding assertions of this thesis were false.  That is to say that the assessment framework developed by the NSW Alternative Waste Management Technologies and Practices Inquiry is not suitable for use in evaluating resource recovery options.  Furthermore a refined assessment framework based on this approach is also unable to identify optimal resource recovery options as demonstrated using wood waste as a case study. The results of this research points to the overall conclusion that any discrete option evaluation and assessment for resource recovery technologies that results in a single summary score for each option will be fundamentally flawed, providing no value in determining optimal resource recovery solutions for the Greater Sydney Region. A systems approach is suggested as an alternative method for the evaluation of optimal resource recovery, the starting point of which is to ask 'what is the highest resource value of the components in the material stream under consideration and how could a network of infrastructure be designed in order to allow materials to flow to their highest resource value use?'  A feature of such an integrated approach is a focus on the materials composition of recovered resources, as opposed to recovery technologies, resulting in a 'fit for purpose' as opposed to a 'forced fit' style of resource recovery. It is recommended that further research and public policy efforts be made in logistics planning across the Greater Sydney Region (as opposed to a regional or local government area) in order to create network opportunities for integrated flows of materials to move toward their highest resource value.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">waste;resource recovery;alternative waste technologies;wood waste;assessment framework</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Packaging curiosities : towards a grammar of three-dimensional space</field><field name="creator">Stenglin, Maree Kristen</field><field name="description">Western museums are public institutions, open and accessible to all sectors of the population  they serve. Increasingly, they are becoming more accountable to the governments that fund  them, and criteria such as visitation figures are being used to assess their viability. In order to  ensure their survival in the current climate of economic rationalism, museums need to  maintain their audiences and attract an even broader demographic. To do this, they need to  ensure that visitors feel comfortable, welcome and secure inside their spaces. They also need  to give visitors clear entry points for engaging with and valuing the objects and knowledge on  display in exhibitions.  This thesis maps a grammar of three-dimensional space with a strong focus on the  interpersonal metafunction. Building on the social semiotic tools developed by Halliday  (1978, 1985a), Halliday and Hasan (1976), Martin (1992) and Matthiessen (1995), it identifies  two interpersonal resources for organising space: Binding and Bonding. Binding is the main  focus of the thesis. It theorises the way people&#65533;s emotions can be affected by the organisation  of three-dimensional space. Essentially, it explores the affectual disposition that exists  between a person and the space that person occupies by focussing on how a space can be  organised to make an occupant feel secure or insecure. Binding is complemented by Bonding.  Bonding is concerned with the way the occupants of a space are positioned interpersonally to  create solidarity. In cultural institutions like museums and galleries, Bonding is concerned  with making visitors feel welcome and as though they belong, not just to the building and the  physical environment, but to a community of like-minded people. Such feelings of belonging  are also crucial to the long-term survival of the museum.  Finally, in order to present a metafunctionally diversified grammar of space, the thesis moves  beyond interpersonal meanings. It concludes by exploring the ways textual and ideational  meanings can be organised in three-dimensional space.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Museums;Semiotics;Social Semiotics;Space;Architecture;Emotion;Interpersonal meaning;Metafuctions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Violation to Reconstruction:  The Process of Self-Renewal Associated with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome</field><field name="creator">Travers, Michele Kerry</field><field name="description">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a contested condition that generates scepticism and occupies a marginalised position within medical and social contexts.  The thesis examines the illness experiences, and specifically the experiences of self, for people affected with CFS.  Using qualitative inquiry, a substantive theory related to the process of self-renewal and adaptation associated with CFS is explicated.  The theory encompasses the trajectory of CFS from onset to chronicity, and in exceptional instances, recovery.  Illness narratives were derived from in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 19 adults, including 16 people affected with, and 3 people recovered from, CFS.  Data was coded and analysed using a grounded theory approach.  Analysis generated two parallel narratives that defined the illness experience of CFS: the narrative of the illness biographies and the narrative of self, specifically the struggling and diminished self seeking renewal.  The illness biographies encompassed the stories of symptoms and their explanations, the encounters that ensued and their contentious milieu.  The narrative of self was the primary narrative.  It articulated the negative consequences to self and personhood associated with CFS, named the Violation of Self, and the consequent efforts of participants to decrease the struggle and violation by use of the Guardian Response and the Reconstructing Response.  The Guardian Response provided protection and self-reclamation.  The Reconstructing Response fostered self-renewal and meaning.  The two narratives were bridged by the threats of CFS.  That is, the illness biographies were accompanied by threats of disruption related to chronic illness, and by threats of invalidation that arose from CFS as a contested condition.

This population is at high risk of falls and fractures, which bring significant morbidity and mortality.  The prevalence of osteoporosis also increases with age, but there have been few studies of bone density in residents of hostels and nursing homes.  This thesis looked at the prevalence of osteoporosis and falls in elderly people in residential care, to define the size of the problem and identify risk factors for low bone density and falling, with particular reference to vitamin D levels.    Two thousand and five men and women aged between 65 and 104 years were enrolled in the Falls and Fracture Risk in the Elderly Epidemiology (FREE) study between 1999 and 2003.  The key findings from analysis of this population were firstly, that quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measures were higher in men than women independent of age, and that in men there was no significant decline in either BUA or VOS, but in women BUA declined by over 3% per decade and VOS by 1% per decade.  Both ultrasound machines used in the study were shown to be reliable, with precision unaffected by advanced age. QUS was found to be sensitive to longitudinal change even in this frail elderly cohort.    Vitamin D deficiency was found in the majority of elderly aged care facility residents but supplementation conferred higher serum 25-OH-vitamin D levels.  Vitamin D levels were not shown to be related to BUA, VOS or the risk of falling in this population.  Serum parathyroid hormone might be important in determining future falls risk.      In summary, the results of this thesis give an important insight into the prevalence of osteoporosis and falls in the frail elderly, and how these might be predicted.  Future study of prospective fracture rates in this group will then be able to assess relative risk factors for osteoporotic fracture, and identify those individuals who might benefit from directed fracture prevention strategies.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Osteoporsis;Epidemiology;Elderly</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins of Bagan: The archaeological landscape of Upper Burma to AD 1300.</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Bob</field><field name="description">The archaeological landscape of Upper Burma from the middle of the first millennium BC to the Bagan period in the 13th-14th century AD is a landscape of continuity. Finds of polished stone and bronze artifacts suggest the existence of early metal-using cultures in the Chindwin and Samon River Valleys, and along parts of the Ayeyarwady plain. Increasing technological and settlement complexity in the Samon Valley suggests that a distinctive culture whose agricultural and trade success can be read in the archaeological record of the Late Prehistoric period developed there. The appearance of the early urban &#65533;Pyu&#65533; system of walled central places during the early first millennium AD seems to have involved a spread of agricultural and management skills and population from the Samon. The leaders of the urban centres adopted Indic symbols and Sanskrit modes of kingship to enhance and extend their authority. The early urban system was subject over time to a range of stresses including siltation of water systems, external disruption and social changes as Buddhist notions of leadership eclipsed Brahmanical ones. The archaeological evidence indicates that a settlement was forming at Bagan during the last centuries of the first millennium AD. By the mid 11th century Bagan began to dominate Upper Burma, and the region began a transition from a system of largely autonomous city states to a centralised kingdom. Inscriptions of the 11th to 13th centuries indicate that as the Bagan Empire expanded it subsumed the agricultural lands that had been developed by the Pyu.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">archaeology;myanmar;burma;urbanism;bronze age;GIS;Pyu</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/638</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of temperature and photoperiod on broccoli development, yield and quality in south-east Queensland</field><field name="creator">Tan, Daniel Kean Yuen</field><field name="description">Broccoli is a vegetable crop of increasing importance in Australia, particularly in south-east Queensland and farmers need to maintain a regular supply of good quality broccoli to meet the expanding market. However, harvest maturity date, head yield and quality are all affected by climatic variations during the production cycle, particularly low temperature episodes. There are also interactions between genotype and climatic variability. A predictive model of ontogeny, incorporating climatic data including frost risk, would enable farmers to predict harvest maturity date and select appropriate cultivar - sowing date combinations. The first stage of this research was to define floral initiation, which is fundamental to predicting ontogeny. Scanning electron micrographs of the apical meristem were made for the transition from the vegetative to advanced reproductive stage. During the early vegetative stage (stage 1), the apical meristem was a small, pointed shoot tip surrounded by leaf primordia. The transitional stage (stage 2) was marked by a widening and flattening to form a dome-shaped apical meristem. In the floral initiation stage (stage 3), the first-order floral primordia were observed in the axils of the developing bracts. Under field conditions, the shoot apex has an average diameter of 500 micro m at floral initiation and floral primordia can be observed under a light microscope. Sub-zero temperatures can result in freezing injury and thereby reduce head yield and quality. In order to predict the effects of frosts, it is desirable to know the stages of development at which plants are most susceptible. Therefore, the effects of sub-zero temperatures on leaf and shoot mortality, head yield and quality were determined after exposure of plants to a range of temperatures for short periods, at different stages of development (vegetative, floral initiation and buttoning). Plants in pots and in the field were subjected to sub-zero temperature regimes from -1 C to -19 C. Extracellular ice formation was achieved by reducing temperatures slowly, at a rate of -2 C per hour. The floral initiation stage was most sensitive to freezing injury, as yields were significantly reduced at -1 C and -3 C, and shoot apices were killed at -5 C. There was no significant yield reduction when the inflorescence buttoning stage was subjected to -1 C and -3 C. Although shoot apices at buttoning survived the -5 C treatment, very poor quality heads of uneven bud size were produced as a result of arrested development. The lethal temperature for pot-grown broccoli was between -3 C and -5 C, whereas the lethal temperature for field-grown broccoli was between -7 C and -9 C. The difference was presumably due to variation in cold acclimation. Freezing injury can reduce broccoli head yield and quality, and retard plant growth. Crop development models based only on simple thermal time without restrictions will not predict yield or maturity if broccoli crops are frost-damaged. Field studies were conducted to develop procedures for predicting ontogeny, yield and quality. Three cultivars, (Fiesta, Greenbelt and Marathon) were sown on eight dates from 11 March to 22 May 1997, and grown under natural and extended (16 h) photoperiods in a sub-tropical environment at Gatton College, south-east Queensland, under non-limiting conditions of water and nutrient supply. Daily climatic data, and dates of emergence, floral initiation, harvest maturity, together with yield and quality were obtained. Yield and quality responses to temperature and photoperiod were quantified. As growing season mean minimum temperatures decreased, fresh weight of tops decreased while fresh weight harvest index increased linearly. There was no definite relationship between fresh weight of tops or fresh weight harvest index and growing season minimum temperatures greater than 10 C. Genotype, rather than the environment, mainly determined head quality attributes. Fiesta had the best head quality, with higher head shape and branching angle ratings than Greenbelt or Marathon. Bud colour and cluster separation of Marathon were only acceptable for export when growing season mean minimum temperatures were less than 8 C. Photoperiod did not influence yield or quality in any of the three cultivars. A better understanding of genotype and environmental interactions will help farmers optimise yield and quality, by matching cultivars with time of sowing. Crop developmental responses to temperature and photoperiod were quantified from emergence to harvest maturity (Model 1), from emergence to floral initiation (Model 2), from floral initiation to harvest maturity (Model 3), and in a combination of Models 2 and 3 (Model 4). These thermal time models were based on optimised base and optimum temperatures of 0 and 20 C, respectively. These optimised temperatures were determined using an iterative optimisation routine (simplex). Cardinal temperatures were consistent across cultivars but thermal time of phenological intervals were cultivar specific. Sensitivity to photoperiod and solar radiation was low in the three cultivars used. Thermal time models tested on independent data for five cultivars (Fiesta, Greenbelt, Marathon, CMS Liberty and Triathlon) grown as commercial crops on the Darling Downs over two years, adequately predicted floral initiation and harvest maturity. Model 4 provided the best prediction for the chronological duration from emergence to harvest maturity. Model 1 was useful when floral initiation data were not available, and it predicted harvest maturity almost as well as Model 4 since the same base and optimum temperatures of 0 C and 20 C, respectively, were used for both phenological intervals. Model 1 was also generated using data from 1979-80 sowings of three cultivars (Premium Crop, Selection 160 and Selection 165A). When Model 1 was tested with independent data from 1983-84, it predicted harvest maturity well. Where floral initiation data were available, predictions of harvest maturity were most precise using Model 3, since the variation, which occurred from emergence to floral initiation, was removed. Prediction of floral initiation using Model 2 can be useful for timing cultural practices, and for avoiding frost and high temperature periods. This research has produced models to assist broccoli farmers in crop scheduling and cultivar selection in south-east Queensland. Using the models as a guide, farmers can optimise yield and quality, by matching cultivars with sowing date. By accurately predicting floral initiation, the risk of frost damage during floral initiation can be reduced by adjusting sowing dates or crop management options. The simple and robust thermal time models will improve production and marketing arrangements, which have to be made in advance. The thermal time models in this study, incorporating frost risk using conditional statements, provide a foundation for a decision support system to manage the sequence of sowings on commercial broccoli farms.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">broccoli;Brassica oleracea;Brassicaceae;models;thermal time;yield;quality;development;freezing injury</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">VERSUS THE VOX POPULI  Reflections on the practice of art as a quest for liberation</field><field name="creator">Heine, Martin</field><field name="description">This dissertation is an attempt to define the constellation of circumstances and ideas,  which has determined my strategy in the paintings and performances submitted for  examination. Unlike many artists I do not accept the fact of postmodernity. On the  contrary, art and life remain suspended between the future and the past, the essential  modernist condition.  I argue for this in the introduction and the first two chapters, through a description of  the performance work of Joseph Beuys and on my reaction to it in a performance in  which I attempted to examine the practical paradoxes of art making in late modernity.  I take my position largely from the Frankfurt school and succeeding debates about  their work up to Zizek. For, while we remain in modernity we cannot regard it simply  as an unfinished project. It is no longer possible to adopt an avant-garde position in  one&#65533;s practice.  The central section of the thesis contains a series of studies of the careers of major  artists who have faced up to the paradoxes of modernity from Picasso to Richter and  Parr. Through their successes, failures and sometimes duplicity, a practical profile  emerges &#65533; a guide to the limits of contemporary practice.

Globalisation, it has been argued, creates pressures for convergence that will increasingly undermine national diversity in industrial relations institutions and outcomes. At its most extreme, the globalisation thesis predicts &#65533;a universal race to the bottom&#65533; of labour standards.  This globalisation thesis has been broadly criticised in the comparative industrial relations literature. Rather, a growing body of comparative industrial relations literature has pointed to evidence of continued diversity, despite the common pressures associated with changes in the international economy. This literature has focussed on the importance national level institutional variables play in explaining diversity and suggested that differences in national level institutional variables are likely to produce cross-national divergence rather than convergence.  While the institutionalist approach represents an important corrective to the globalisation thesis, it has difficulty explaining similarities in patterns of industrial relations changes, despite institutional differences across countries, and is largely unable to explain changes in the institutions themselves. This thesis argues that these limitations of the institutionalist approach reflect its intellectual origins in comparative politics.  The major contribution of this thesis is the development of an interaction approach the relationship between international economic change and the domestic institutions of industrial relations. This alternative theoretical approach, which is drawn from concepts in the political economy tradition in industrial relations and the international political economy literature, identifies four key variables the shape the relationship between international economic change and the domestic institutions of industrial relations: namely, the international economic regime; the national production profile; the accumulation strategy of the state; and the role of institutional effects.  The thesis tests the explanatory power of the interaction approach by focussing on the comparison between two closely matched countries- Australia and New Zealand- during three periods of significant economic change in the international economy: the end of the nineteenth century; the immediate post world war two period; and, in the late 1960s. It shows that each of these periods a focus on changes in the international economy and how they impact the interests of employers, workers and the state helps explain both similarities and differences in industrial relations developments in the two countries. In doing so it demonstrates the importance of what appear to be small differences between the cases.  The ability of the interaction approach to account for similarities and differences across three time periods in two most similar countries suggests that it may have broader application in cross-national comparison and that may provide the basis for a more general reassessment of the relationship between the contemporary wave of globalisation and industrial relations institutions and outcomes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Globalisation;Industrial Relations</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Buildings and Hecke Algebras</field><field name="creator">Parkinson, James William</field><field name="description">We establish a strong connection between buildings and Hecke algebras through the study of two algebras of averaging operators on buildings. To each locally finite regular building we associate a natural algebra B of chamber set averaging operators, and when the building is affine we also define an algebra A of vertex set averaging operators.    In the affine case, it is shown how the building gives rise to a combinatorial and geometric description of the Macdonald spherical functions, and of the centers of affine Hecke algebras.      The algebra homomorphisms from A into the complex numbers are studied, and some associated spherical harmonic analysis is conducted. This generalises known results concerning spherical functions on groups of p-adic type.     As an application of this spherical harmonic analysis we prove a local limit theorem for radial random walks on affine buildings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">building;affine;Hecke algebra;Macdonald spherical function;random walk;harmonic analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding The Relationship Between Moral Reasoning And Liberalism-Conservatism</field><field name="creator">Marx, Benjamin Robert</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to clarify the nature of the relationship between moral reasoning, as per the neo-Kohlbergian DIT approach of Rest and his colleagues, and liberalism-conservatism.  Moral reasoning and liberalism-conservatism are consistently found to be related but the resultant interpretation that liberals are more moral-cognitively advanced than conservatives has been challenged by Emler and his colleagues who argue that the DIT is liberally biased.  Subsequent research on this issue has produced a methodological quagmire that this thesis aims to proceed beyond.      The specific aim of this thesis is to test several different (or competing) hypotheses purporting to explain the relationship between Kohlbergian moral reasoning and liberalism-conservatism.  These are (1) that liberals are more morally advanced than conservatives; (2) that "advanced moral reasoning" is merely social presentation; (3) that moral reasoning is separately constrained by moral development and conservatism; (4) that moral development and liberalism represent distinct paths to postconventional reasoning preference; (5) that moral reasoning differences between liberals and conservatives are broader than usually thought; (6) that the political content of moral issues affects moral reasoning differences between liberals and conservatives; and (7) that moral reasoning instruments have exaggerated moral reasoning differences between liberals and conservatives.    Study 1 found that a non-ipsative, indirect moral reasoning measure was correlated with liberalism-conservatism thus disconfirming hypotheses 2 and 7.  Additionally, hypothesis 5 was not supported by several DIT findings.  Opposing hypotheses 2 and 6, Study 2 found that a conservative version of the DIT was correlated with liberalism-conservatism although a potential methodological issue arose.  Study 3 developed an objective measure of moral comprehension, broader in scope than previous moral comprehension measures, which demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity.  Employing this measure, Study 4 found that moral comprehension and liberalism were weakly correlated and that they independently predicted moral reasoning, although their interaction did not.  Together, these findings provide some support to hypotheses 1 and 4 but not hypotheses 3 and 6.    Overall these findings reveal that liberals appear more moral-cognitively advanced than conservatives but, compared to conservatives, liberals appear to indicate preference for advanced moral reasoning earlier in their moral-cognitive development.  This latter mechanism appears stronger and suggests that, although DIT scores are still somewhat reflective of moral-cognitive development, the DIT&#65533;s estimate of liberals&#65533; moral-cognitive development is elevated.  Future research can continue to explore these hypotheses (e.g., via longitudinal and/or "faking" studies) and, in so doing, further clarify the relationship between Kohlbergian moral reasoning and liberalism-conservatism.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Moral Reasoning;Defining Issues Test;Liberal;Conservative;Political Orientation;Moral Comprehension</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dietary energy density and the performance characteristics of growing pigs</field><field name="creator">Henman, David James</field><field name="description">Optimal nutritional management of growing pigs is constrained by lack of quantitative information on the response of animals between 30 and 110 kg live weight to dietary energy content. Under 'ideal' conditions modern genotypes appear to adjust feed intake to maintain a constant DE intake over a much wider range of dietary energy concentrations than previously thought (Mullan et al, 1998). However, under commercial pen conditions, voluntary feed intake is lower, pigs respond in terms of both growth rate and feed conversion to dietary DE density considerably above the levels currently thought to maximise biological and economic responses. The present study was designed to provide information on the response of growing pigs to dietary energy content under ideal and commercial housing conditions for two growth periods 30-60kg liveweight and 60-100kg liveweight.  The results of the pigs kept under individual (ideal) housed conditions were consistent with the literature in that they adjusted their voluntary feed intake with digestible energy density to maintain a constant energy intake. The results of the pigs kept in groups (commercial) housing conditions tended to increase their daily energy intake as the energy density of the feed increased. This increase in energy intake improved the growth rate of the pigs and increased the fat deposition of those pigs. Economic analysis of the experiments involving pigs in groups indicates that formulating diets to a least cost per megajoule of digestible energy is not the most profitable point to set the digestible energy density. Modelling programs need to be used to determine where the least cost per unit of growth of the pig occurs. This is the most economical digestible energy density to formulate too. This will have major impact on the cost of production of piggery operations as the cost of energy is the single most important parameter in the cost of producing a pig.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">growing pigs;dietary energy density;housing;economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the use of a web-based virtual patient to support learning through reflection</field><field name="creator">Chesher, Douglas</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the support of learning through reflection, in the context of medical students and practitioners, working through a series of simulated consultations involving the diagnosis and management of chronic illness.    A model of the medical consultative process was defined, on which a web-based patient simulation was developed. This simulation can be accessed over the Internet using commonly available web-browsers. It enables users to interact with a virtual patient by taking a history, examining the patient, requesting and reviewing investigations, and choosing appropriate management strategies. The virtual patient can be reviewed over a number of consultations, and the patient outcome is dependant on the management strategy selected by the user.    A second model was also developed, that adds a layer of reflection over the consultative process. While interacting with the virtual patient users are asked to formulate and test their hypotheses. Simple tools are included to encourage users to record their observations and thoughts for further learning, as well as providing links to web-based library resources. At the end of each consultation, users are asked to review their actions and indicate whether they think their actions were critical, relevant, or not relevant to the diagnosis and management of the patient in light of their current knowledge. Users also have the opportunity to compare their activity to their peers or an expert in the case under study.     Three formal cycles of evaluation were undertaken during the design and development of the software. A number of clinicians were involved in the initial design to ensure there was an appropriate structure that matched clinical practice. Formative evaluation was conducted to review the usability of the application, and based on user feedback a number of changes were made to the user interface and structure of the application. A third, end user, evaluation was undertaken using a single case concerning the diagnosis and management of hypertriglyceridaemia in the context of Type 1B Glycogen Storage Disease. This evaluation involved ten medical students, five general practitioners and two specialists. The evaluation involved observation using a simplified think-aloud, as well as administration of a questionnaire.     Users were engaged by the simulation, and were able to use the application with only a short period of training. Usability issues still exist with respect to the processing of natural language input, especially when asking questions of the virtual patient. Until such time that natural language recognition is able to provide satisfactory performance, alternative, list-based, methods of interaction will be required.    Evaluation involving medical students, general practitioners, and specialist medical practitioners demonstrated that reflection can be supported and encouraged by providing appropriate tools, as well as by judiciously interrupting the consultative process and providing time for reflection to take place. Reflection could have been further enhanced if users had been educated on reflection as a learning modality prior to using SIMPRAC. Further work is also required to improve the simulation environment, improve the interfaces for supporting reflection, and further define the benefits of using this approach for medical education and professional development with respect to learning outcomes and behavioural change.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical education;virtual patient simulation;reflection;continuing medical education</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical Studies of Crystallisation in Hard Sphere Systems</field><field name="creator">Wild, Robert John</field><field name="description">The primary focus of this work is to develop an understanding of crystallisation in hard sphere systems. The thesis is presented in two parts.   The first section is an investigation of the liquid/crystal interface at equilibrium using molecular dynamical simulations. The objective is to understand how the interface might bridge between the disordered and ordered states in liquid/crystal environments. Topological measures of structure are used to investigate whether any precursor structures are present in the liquid phase, close to the interface, that would allow transition from disorder to order. This differs from other work where simpler measures of structure, classifying phases into either liquid or crystal, are used. The results indicate that the liquid/crystal interface of a hard sphere system is very narrow and no readily observable structures were found that extended past the width of the equilibrium interface.  The second section of the thesis is a theoretical study of growth kinetics in hard sphere systems using density functional theory. The kinetics in a fixed volume are examined with a single conserved order parameter. The work is extended incorporating both conserved particle and non-conserved structure dynamics. The kinetics of growth are examined and it is shown that the small initial crystals are quickly isolated from the higher pressure of the surrounding system through the development of a depletion zone.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crystallisation;Hard Sphere Systems</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ocean Colour Remote Sensing of Flood Plumes in the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Ametistova, Lioudmila</field><field name="description">The objective of the research reported in this thesis was to develop a technique to monitor the  dynamics of sediments and nutrients entering the coastal ocean with river plumes associated  with high intensity low frequency events (e.g. floods), using ocean colour remote sensing. To  achieve this objective, an inverse bio-optical model was developed, based on analytical and  empirical relationships between concentrations of optically significant substances and remote  sensing of water-leaving radiance. The model determines concentrations of water-colouring  substances such as chlorophyll, suspended sediments, and coloured dissolved organic matter,  as well as the values of optical parameters using water-leaving radiances derived from the  Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS). To solve atmospheric correction in  coastal waters, the aerosol type over clear waters is transferred to adjacent turbid water pixels.  The vicinity of the Herbert River, central Great Barrier Reef zone, Australia, was used as a  case study for the application of the algorithm developed. The satellite ocean colour technique  was successfully validated using sea-truth measurements of water-colouring constituents  acquired in the area during various seasons throughout 2002-2004. A high correlation  between chlorophyll and dissolved organic matter was found in the coastal waters of the  region, and when the bio-optical model was constrained to make chlorophyll a function of  dissolved organic matter, the relationship between in situ and satellite-derived data was  substantially improved. With reliable retrieval of the major water-colouring constituents, the  technique was subsequently applied to study fluxes of particulate and dissolved organic and  inorganic matter following a flood event in the Herbert River during the austral summer of  1999.  Extensive field observations covering a seasonal flood in the Herbert River in February 2004  revealed high sediment and nutrient exports from the river to the adjacent coastal waters  during the flood event. Due to rapid settling, the bulk of the sediment-rich influx was  deposited close inshore, while the majority of nutrients exported from the river were  consumed by phytoplankton in a relatively small area of the coastal ocean. With the help of  ocean colour remote sensing, it was demonstrated that river-borne sediments and nutrients  discharged by a typical flood in the Herbert River are mostly precipitated or consumed within  the first 20 km from the coast and therefore are unlikely to reach and possibly affect the midshelf  coral reefs of this section of the Great Barrier Reef lagoon.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote sensing;Herbert River;Great Barrier Reef;Bio-optical model;Monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independent Expert Reports and Takeovers</field><field name="creator">Bugeja, Martin</field><field name="description">Target firms in Australian takeovers are required to obtain an independent assessment of the offer price in situations where the Corporations Law considers the bidder has a superior bargaining position.  The intention of this requirement is to protect target shareholders from being offered a lower takeover premium.  The only empirical study of expert reports, Eddey (1993), is consistent with expert reports achieving their purpose, as the results indicate no difference in target firm premiums in offers with and without an expert report.  Eddey also reports that a revision in offer price is more likely where an expert indicates the bid is &#65533;not fair and reasonable.&#65533;    Using all takeovers from 1990 to 2000, this thesis aims to re-examine and substantially extend the findings in Eddey.  As the sample includes all bids, irrespective of the form of payment consideration, the thesis will assess whether the results in Eddey can be extrapolated from cash-based bids to all takeover bids.  In addition, the analysis will extend Eddey&#65533;s results by investigating whether expert reports result in a higher probability of a revision in offer price relative to takeovers without an expert report.    This study also investigates the impact of the expert report on bidder announcement abnormal returns and examines the returns to both bidders and targets when the expert report is released.  This will add to the limited current knowledge on the impact of expert reports on the capital market.    This thesis also tests the validity of public criticisms of expert independence.  Firstly, experts have been publicly criticised on the basis that they are not independent from the target firm.  It has been suggested that such experts will be more likely to provide an opinion that agrees with the recommendation of target directors.  Secondly, it has been alleged that experts who are also the target auditor provide their reports at a lower fee by cross-subsidising the reports&#65533; preparation from other fees received from the client.  The concern with this practice is that these reports may be of lower quality.  This criticism is tested by developing an expert fee model.  This fee model is then used to assess whether, similar to evidence in the auditing field, &#65533;quality&#65533; experts earn a fee premium.    The results indicate that the need for an expert report does not affect bidder abnormal returns at either the announcement of the takeover or release of the expert report.  On the other hand, target shareholders earn significantly lower abnormal returns at the announcement of a bid where an expert report is required.  This result is inconsistent with Eddey (1993) and raises doubt over whether experts prevent bidders from using their superior bargaining position to offer target shareholders a lower premium.  Consistent with Eddey, the probability of an alteration in offer price is greater where an adverse expert opinion is given.  The results also show that the presence of an expert increases the likelihood of a bid revision relative to takeovers in general.    Target abnormal returns on the release of an expert report are positive and significant, irrespective of the type of expert opinion.  This result however, is sensitive to any association between the author of the report and the target.  In the case that an expert discloses any prior or current business dealings with the target, abnormal returns are insignificant.  The conclusion from this finding is that the market perceives expert reports prepared by an associate of the target as lacking credibility.  In light of this lack of information content it is recommended corporate regulators review those experts permitted to prepare reports.    Contrary to the published criticisms, experts who have business dealings with the target are just as likely as other experts to provide an opinion that agrees with the recommendation of directors.  The tests of a fee reduction by experts associated to the target indicate significant lower fees where the expert is the target auditor.  Further analysis shows this result is only significant where the auditor is also a non-Big 6/5 firm.  These auditors are also found to provide reports that are significantly shorter than other experts, suggesting the cut in fee is achieved by reducing the amount of effort.

The present two-stage study, using quantitative and qualitative data collection methods, undertook to investigate the extent to which selected personality characteristics influenced nonresident fathers&#65533; continued engagement with children.  The study initially collected demographic and personal data from two hundred and sixty nonresident fathers throughout Australia.  This first stage of data collection focussed on fathers&#65533; experience of the separation and their subsequent frequency and level of contact and their level of involvement with children.  It included several multi-item variables, which measured nonresident fathers&#65533; relationships with former partners and children, their adjustment to their new parental role, their role satisfaction and role strain.  It also included measures of fatherhood salience, nonresident fathers&#65533; parental authority within the separated family, their satisfaction with that authority, their attitude to child support and their perception of resident mothers&#65533; attitude to contact.  It also administered abridged Sensitivity and Impulsivity scales devised by Eysenck (1969).  At the second stage of the study, one hundred and thirty-five of these fathers participated in an interview.  One hundred and twenty of them completed a personality questionnaire, which measured scores on the four folk scales of Responsibility, Socialization, Self-control and Good Impression, taken from the California Psychological Inventory.  The study found Socialization was the only selected personality characteristic to be significantly associated with nonresident fathers&#65533; engagement with children.  All four folk scales were positively correlated with nonresident fathers&#65533; role adjustment, which was significantly associated with nonresident fathers&#65533; contact and was part of the model best predicting their involvement with children.  Results showed that nonresident fathers&#65533; scores on the Sensitivity measure were negatively associated with role adjustment.    Most nonresident fathers in the study had frequent contact with children but limited involvement with them.  They reported having little scope to share in parental decision making or to be involved in children&#65533;s schooling.  The study found fatherhood salience, role adjustment, parental authority and attitude to child support to be positively associated with  engagement.  It showed interparental hostility, interparental conflict and nonresident fathers&#65533; role strain to be negatively correlated with engagement.  The study also found that dissatisfaction with parental authority within the separated family, role strain and a negative attitude to child support were associated with ongoing interparental hostility.   Qualitative data confirmed nonresident fathers&#65533; common experience of being marginalised within the family.  They also revealed that many participants went to great lengths to maintain some parental relevancy for their children, despite social and legal systems tending to impede them from meeting parental responsibilities and caring for their children.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nonresident fathers;access;contact;engagement;personality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/650</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of herbal medicines on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Warfarin in healthy subjects</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xuemin</field><field name="description">Herbal medicines are widely used in our community. A survey of Australian consumers indicated that 60% had used complementary and/or alternative medicines in the past year with the majority not informing their doctor that they were using herbal medicines. Little is known about the potentially serious consequences of interactions between herbal and conventional medicines. Warfarin has an important role in treating people with heart disease, yet it has a narrow therapeutic range, is highly bound to plasma proteins, and is metabolised by cytochrome P450. This creates the potential for life-threatening interactions with other drugs and foods leading to excessive bleeding. Hence, warfarin is one of the most frequently investigated drugs for interaction studies. Early clinical reports suggest that there exists the potential for an interaction between warfarin and four herbal medicines: St John&#65533;s wort, ginseng, ginkgo and ginger. However, these herb-drug combinations have never been conclusively studied.   The two clinical studies conducted as part of this research had an identical study design. Twenty-four healthy male subjects were recruited into the two separate studies. This was an open label, three-way crossover randomised study in twelve healthy male subjects, who received a single 25 mg dose of warfarin alone or after 14 days pre-treatment with St John&#65533;s wort, or 7 days pre-treatment with ginseng. Dosing with St John&#65533;s wort or ginseng was continued for 7 days after administration of the warfarin dose in study I or who received a single 25 mg dose of warfarin alone or after 7 days pre-treatment with recommended doses of ginkgo or ginger from single ingredient products of known quality. Dosing with ginkgo or ginger was continued for 7 days after administration of the warfarin dose in study II. Platelet aggregation, international normalised ratio (INR) of prothrombin time, warfarin enantiomer protein binding, warfarin enantiomer concentrations in plasma and S-7-hydroxywarfarin concentration in urine were measured in both studies. Statistical comparisons were made using ANOVA and 95% confidence interval (CI) for mean value and 90% CI for geometric mean ratio value are reported. n study I, the mean (95% CI) apparent clearance of S-warfarin after warfarin alone or with St John&#65533;s wort or ginseng were, respectively, 198 (174 &#65533; 223) ml/h, 269 (241 &#65533; 297) ml/h and 220 (201 &#65533; 238) ml/h. The respective apparent clearances of R-warfarin were 110 (94 &#65533; 126) ml/h, 142 (123 &#65533; 161) ml/h and 119 (106 &#65533; 131) ml/h. The mean ratio of apparent clearance for S-warfarin was 1.29 (1.16-1.46) and for R-warfarin was 1.23 (1.11-1.37) when St John&#65533;s wort was co-administered. The mean ratio of AUC0-168 of INR was 0.79 (0.70 - 0.95) when St John&#65533;s wort was co-administered. The urinary excretion ratio of S-7-hydroxywarfarin after administration of warfarin alone was 0.04 (0.03 &#65533; 0.06) mg/h and there was no significant difference following treatment with either St John&#65533;s wort 0.03 (0.02 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h or ginseng 0.03 (0.02 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h. The ratio of geometric means for S-7-hydroxywarfarin UER was 0.82 (0.61-1.12) for St John&#65533;s wort, and 0.68 (0.50-0.91) for ginseng. St John&#65533;s wort and ginseng did not affect the apparent volumes of distribution or protein binding of warfarin enantiomers. In study II, the mean (95% CI) apparent clearance of S-warfarin after warfarin alone, with ginkgo or ginger were 189 (167 &#65533; 210) ml/h, 200 (173 &#65533; 227) ml/h and 201 (171 &#65533; 231) ml/h, respectively. The respective apparent clearances of R-warfarin were 127 (106 &#65533; 149) ml/h, 126 (111 &#65533; 141) ml/h and 131 (106 &#65533; 156) ml/h. The mean ratio of apparent clearance for S-warfarin was 1.05 (0.98 -1.12) and for R-warfarin was 1.00 (0.93 -1.08) when co-administered with ginkgo. The mean ratio of AUC0-168 of INR was 0.93 (0.81 -1.05) when co-administered with ginkgo. The mean ratio of apparent clearance for S-warfarin was 1.05 (0.97 -1.13) and for R-warfarin was 1.02 (0.95 -1.10) when co-administered with ginger. The mean ratio of AUC0-168 of INR was 1.01 (0.93 -1.15) when co-administered with ginger. The urinary excretion ratio (UER) of S-7-hydroxywarfarin after administration of warfarin alone was 0.04 (0.03 &#65533; 0.05) mg/h and there was no significant difference following treatment with either ginkgo 0.04 (0.03 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h or ginger 0.03 (0.02 &#65533; 0.04) mg/h. The ratio of geometric means for S-7-hydroxywarfarin UER was 1.07 (0.69-1.67) for ginkgo, and 1.00 (0.64-1.56) for ginger. Ginkgo and ginger did not affect the apparent volumes of distribution or protein binding of either S-warfarin or R-warfarin.   In conclusion, St John&#65533;s wort significantly induced the apparent clearance of both S-warfarin and R-warfarin, which in turn resulted in a significant reduction in the pharmacological effect of rac-warfarin.  Ginseng, ginkgo and ginger at recommended doses affect neither clotting status, nor the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of either S-warfarin or R-warfarin in healthy subjects.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Warfarin;St John's Wort;Ginseng;ginger;herb-drug interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/651</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATOR DESIGN OPTIMISATION FOR SHAPE CONTROL OF SMART COMPOSITE PLATE STRUCTURES</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van Ky Quan</field><field name="description">Shape control of a structure with distributed piezoelectric actuators can be achieved through optimally selecting the loci, shapes and sizes of the piezoelectric actuators and choosing the electric fields applied to the actuators. Shape control can be categorised as either static or dynamic shape control. Whether it is a transient or gradual change, static or dynamic shape control, both aim to determine the loci, sizes, and shapes of piezoelectric actuators, and the applied voltages such that a desired structural shape is achieved effectively.   This thesis is primarily concerned with establishing a finite element formulation for the general smart laminated composite plate structure, which is capable to analyse static and dynamic deformation using non-rectangular elements. The mechanical deformation of the smart composite plate is modelled using a third order plate theory, while the electric field is simulated based on a layer-wise theory. The finite element formulation for static and dynamics analysis is verified by comparing with available numerical results. Selected experiments have also been conducted to measure structural deformation and the experimental results are used to correlate with those of the finite element formulation for static analysis. In addition, the Linear Least Square (LLS) method is employed to study the effect of different piezoelectric actuator patch pattern on the results of error function, which is the least square error between the calculated and desired structural shapes in static structural shape control.    The second issue of this thesis deals with piezoelectric actuator design optimisation (PADO) for quasi-static shape control by finding the applied voltage and the configuration of piezoelectric actuator patch to minimise error function, whereas the piezoelectric actuator configuration is defined based on the optimisation technique of altering nodal coordinates (size/shape optimisation) or eliminating inefficient elements in a structural mesh (topology optimisation). Several shape control algorithms are developed to improve the structural shape control by reducing the error function. Further development of the GA-based voltage and piezoelectric actuator design optimisation method includes the constraint handling, where the error function can be optimised subjected to energy consumption or other way around. The numerical examples are presented in order to verify that the proposed algorithms are applicable to quasi-static shape control based on voltage and piezoelectric actuator design optimisation (PADO) in terms of minimising the error function.   The third issue is to use the present finite element formulation for a modal shape control and for controlling resonant vibration of smart composite plate structures. The controlled resonant vibration formulation is developed. Modal analysis and LLS methods are also employed to optimise the applied voltage to piezoelectric actuators for achieving the modal shapes. The Newmark direct time integration method is used to study harmonic excitation of smart structures. Numerical results are presented to induce harmonic vibration of structure with controlled magnitude via adjusting the damping and to verify the controlled resonant vibration formulation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shape Control; Piezoelectric Actuators/Sensors; Composite Plates; Finite Element Analysis; Structural Optimisation; Sensitivity Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transition from foraging to farming in northeast China</field><field name="creator">Jia, Wei Ming</field><field name="description">This thesis is using a framework to analyse the process of transition from foraging to farming in northeast China.

Disease afflicts humans. It afflicts animals. It afflicts plants. People refer to disease in their everyday conversation. Newspapers comment upon it. Parliaments enact legislation regarding it. Novelists write about it. Artists depict it. Physicians, veterinary surgeons and agriculturalists seek to combat it. Insurance companies offer reimbursement against it. Anthropologists study it. Philosophers debate its nature, and dictionaries define it. Disease looms large in human consciousness.    One might presume that, since disease is so important in daily life, human beings would know exactly what they mean by it. Most people seem to believe instinctively that they understand the nature of disease, and that their ideas about it coincide with other people&#65533;s ideas. The definition of disease therefore arouses little controversy in everyday conversation. People use the word disease as readily as they use the words spade, or table or nose. They suggest, when they joke that somebody calls a spade a spade, that the nature of the implement used to dig the garden is so obvious that it requires no further definition. Similarly with a table or a nose. They might debate how many legs a table must have, but&#65533;regardless of the answer&#65533;rarely deny that it is a table; whilst every human must surely know what a nose is. This high level of agreement about so many commonly used terms perhaps creates an assumption that the meaning of disease is equally obvious and requires no further analysis.  Is this, however, really the case?    Disease is a somewhat less concrete phenomenon than is a spade or a table or a nose. Its existence, most would agree, is incontrovertible, but its nature is less clear. It is something that seems to befall people and animals and plants. It rarely serves any useful purpose. It often carries dire implications. It is something that most of us would prefer not to have, but rarely succeed in avoiding. It commonly comes unannounced and at inconvenient times. It usually causes distress, but not always. It can have a fatal outcome. Some people appear more prone to it that others. It sometimes sweeps through whole populations producing social devastation, but its manifestations vary. Some diseases affect a person&#65533;s whole body, others merely a part of the body; some affect some parts of the body, others other parts. Some diseases only affect humans, whereas others affect both humans and animals. Some spread from animals to humans, others from humans to humans, and others still do not appear to spread at all. Some diseases affect plants, and few that affect plants seem to affect humans, but some humans can acquire diseases when they come into contact with plants that appear to have no diseases. Any reasonable analysis of the nature of disease must account for all these aspects and many others also.    The nature of disease is a topic that has attracted the attention of physicians, scientists and philosophers over millennia. The close association that existed between medicine and philosophy in the classical Egyptian, Palestinian and Greek eras ensured that scholars who flourished in those societies examined the nature of disease. Comparable developments occurred in classical Indian and Chinese civilizations. The natural philosophers of Renaissance and post-Renaissance Europe divided into competing schools of thought over the nature of disease. More recent years have witnessed an enormous flourishing of physicians, pathologists, and agriculturalists who study aspects of disease that relate to their individual disciplines. Most of these researchers have, however, examined ever-narrower aspects of specific diseases&#65533;such as manifestations, mechanisms and causes&#65533;rather than the generic nature of the phenomenon.    Some contemporary philosophers, on the other hand, have become interested in general aspects of the topic. They have proposed a number of novel ideas and reached some stimulating conclusions, although they can hardly yet claim to have reached a consensus. This lack of unanimity presumably implies that the issues involved require closer analysis if a formulation is to emerge that most of them can accept.    The object of the present thesis is to undertake such an analysis. It will start by outlining in this introduction the general background to the topic. It will then detail the more noteworthy of previously proposed theories about the nature of this phenomenon, classifying them according to their most prominent components, and assessing their several strengths and weaknesses. It will next discuss the specific philosophical issues of definition, causation, and explication in the biomedical context, before suggesting a comprehensive, but succinct, definition that acknowledges many older views about disease, encompasses current usage, and provides a theoretical base from which to work into the future. It will finally test the strengths and weaknesses of that definition to account for observed phenomena and to accommodate some former definitions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disease;Definition of disease;Explication of Disease</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multiple roles of zinc finger domains</field><field name="creator">Simpson, Raina Jui Yu</field><field name="description">Zinc finger (ZnF) domains are prevalent in eukaryotes and play crucial roles in mediating protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. This Thesis focuses on the molecular details underlying interactions mediated by two ZnF domains.  The GATA-1 protein is vital for the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. Pertinent to the protein function is the N-terminal ZnF. In particular, this domain mediates interaction with DNA containing GATC motifs and the coactivator protein FOG. The importance of these interactions was illustrated by the findings in Chapter 3 that naturally occurring mutations identified in patients suffering from blood disorders affect the interaction of the N-terminal ZnF with either DNA (R216Q mutation) or FOG (V205M and G208S mutations).  In addition to the interaction FOG makes with GATA-1, it also interacts with the centrosomal protein TACC3. In Chapter 4, this interaction is characterised in detail. The solution structure of the region of FOG responsible for the interaction is determined using NMR spectroscopy, revealing that it is a true classical zinc finger, and characterisation of the interaction domain of TACC3 showed that the region is a dimeric coiled-coil. The FOG:TACC3 interaction appears to be mediated by a-helices from the two proteins. The data presented here represent some of the first described molecular details of how a classical ZnF can contact a protein partner. Interestingly, the a-helix used by the FOG finger to bind TACC3 is the same region utilised by DNA-binding classical zinc fingers to contact DNA.   In addition to the multiple roles played by ZnFs, this domain is also known for its robustness and versatility. In Chapter 5, incomplete ZnF sequences were assessed for its ability to form functional zinc-binding domains. Remarkably, CCHX sequences (in the context of BKLF finger 3) were able to form discrete zinc-binding domains and also, mediate both protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions. This result not only illustrates the robust nature of ZnFs, it highlights the need for expanding ZnF sequence criteria when searching for functional zinc-binding modules.  Together, the data presented here help further our understanding of zinc finger domains. Similar to the use of DNA-binding ZnFs in designer proteins, these data may start us on the path of designing novel protein-binding ZnFs.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zinc fingers;protein-protein;protein-DNA;interactions</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Meaningless Laugh:   Laughter in Japanese Communication</field><field name="creator">Hayakawa, Haruko</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the functions of laughter in Japanese communication. In orientation it contrasts markedly with previous studies and is the first study to have been based on such a large volume of data. In this paper I have focused on laughter as it serves to maintain a co-operative relationship between the participants in a conversation. I find that in the process of communication, people necessarily have to lay themselves open to others, and in doing so they become conscious of the barrier surrounding and protecting their field, i.e. their &#65533;inner world&#65533;. I hypothesise that in Japanese at least it is consciousness of this barrier that causes the occurrence of laughter in discourse. In other words, people laugh as part of the process of opening up to others, and also to show their intention to be co-operative. By laughing, people are either confirming that they belong to the same in-group, or they are pretending to belong to the same in-group in order to show co-operation.  In my model, laughter is classified:  A: Joyful laughter for identifying with the in-group B: Balancing laughter for easing tension C: Laughter as a cover-up.  A is also divided into 3 subcategories, B into 3, and C into 2 according to the subject of the utterance and the direction of movement into the protective barrier.  Two types of statistical analysis were applied to the data in order to the test the validity of the classification.

Previous studies of respiration in operatic singing have not taken into account the professional performer&#65533;s ability to differentiate at will between rehearsal and performance modes of singing. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the differences between singing &#65533;with intention to communicate&#65533; (as if performing) and singing &#65533;technically&#65533; (as if in rehearsal). The hypothesis is that this specified change of condition would change the respiratory patterns employed by the singers. Estimation of respiratory patterns was obtained using magnetometers. Performance singing was labelled &#65533;IC&#65533; (intention to communicate). Rehearsal singing was labelled &#65533;T&#65533; (technical) and also included &#65533;TL&#65533; (technical loud) and &#65533;TS&#65533; (technical soft). Each of the five singers performed two tasks (a free choice aria in Italian, and a set song). Only intra-subject analysis was used. One thousand and one breaths were analysed. These were then matched, so that only complete musical phrases (sung six times by the same singer) were compared with each other. Seven hundred and sixty-two matched phrases were analysed in this way. Measured variables were initiation lung volume (ILV), termination lung volume (TLV), the amount of lung volume expired (LVE), %VC released per second (Flow), the expiratory time (Te), and inspiratory time (Ti). Sound pressure level (SPL) was measured. This study also examined the ability of experienced listeners to distinguish between the T and IC performances from DAT recordings. Findings show that in comparison with T singing, IC singing used more air, with a greater percentage of vital capacity expired per second, but without a simple association with sound pressure level or expiratory time. Listeners were able to distinguish IC from T performances, demonstrating a perceived difference in the quality of the vocal output. These results demonstrate that performance intention to communicate, compared to rehearsal, results in a measurable difference in respiratory parameters, and therefore needs to be specified in future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Operatic Singing;Respiration;Emotional Expression;Intention to Communicate</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-Range Imaging Radar for Autonomous Navigation</field><field name="creator">Brooker, Graham Michael</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the theoretical and practical implementation of a long-range  high-resolution millimetre wave imaging radar system to aid with the navigation and  guidance of both airborne and ground-based autonomous vehicles. To achieve true  autonomy, a vehicle must be able to sense its environment, comprehensively, over a  broad range of scales. Objects in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle must be  classified at high resolution to ensure that the vehicle can traverse the terrain. At  slightly longer ranges, individual features such as trees and low branches must be  resolved to allow for short-range path planning. At long range, general terrain  characteristics must be known so that the vehicle can plan around difficult or  impassable obstructions. Finally, at the largest scale, the vehicle must be aware of the  direction to its objective.  In the past, short-range sensors based on radar and laser technology have been capable  of producing high-resolution maps in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle extending  out to a few hundred metres at most. For path planning, and navigation applications  where a vehicle must traverse many kilometres of unstructured terrain, a sensor  capable of imaging out to at least 3km is required to permit mid and long-range  motion planning. This thesis addresses this need by describing the development a  high-resolution interrupted frequency modulated continuous wave (FMICW) radar  operating at 94GHz.  The contributions of this thesis include a comprehensive analysis of both FMCW and  FMICW processes leading to an effective implementation of a radar prototype which  is capable of producing high-resolution reflectivity images of the ground at low  grazing angles. A number of techniques are described that use these images and some  a priori knowledge of the area, for both feature and image based navigation. It is  shown that sub-pixel registration accuracies can be achieved to achieve navigation  accuracies from a single image that are superior to those available from GPS.  For a ground vehicle to traverse unknown terrain effectively, it must select an  appropriate path from as long a range as possible. This thesis describes a technique to  use the reflectivity maps generated by the radar to plan a path up to 3km long over  rough terrain. It makes the assumption that any change in the reflectivity  characteristics of the terrain being traversed should be avoided if possible, and so,  uses a modified form of the gradient-descent algorithm to plan a path to achieve this.  The millimetre wave radar described here will improve the performance of  autonomous vehicles by extending the range of their high-resolution sensing  capability by an order of magnitude to 3km. This will in turn enable significantly  enhanced capability and wider future application for these systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">millimetre wave radar;imaging;navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Embedding research as core practice for teachers: a model for whole school teacher learning</field><field name="creator">Merritt, Llian</field><field name="description">This is a study of teacher professional development at the school level using teacher research as a strategy for both teacher professional learning and school change. A qualitative study was conducted to determine the conditions that would develop and sustain teachers researching their own practice in a culture of inquiry. Participant observation in one school over a two year period was used to investigate the issue of how to embed teacher research as a central feature of teachers&#65533; work.   As a result of working with teachers as they researched their practice I have developed a model to explain and understand the complexities of schools and their cultures. Teachers researching their practice provided the driving force in the interplay of the elements of the model and had the potential to change school culture.  Relationships, structures and processes are central to this model. Social and professional relationships between the teachers and the university partner developed and were supported by structures and processes. As the research continued these relationships changed and evolved. These relationships help develop a culture of inquiry in schools.   The school/university partnership in this study evolved from an initial symbiotic&#65533;cooperative partnership (in which I shared my expertise and supported the work of teachers) into a later organic&#65533;collaborative partnership (one based on mutual and shared goals and benefits). The existing team of four teachers and the allocation of time for them to meet provided the essential structures for the teachers to research their practice. The collective leadership style instigated by the school Principal provided important human and financial support for the development of inquiry cultures.   Collaboration and collegiality as forms of association enabled teachers to conduct research which challenged their individual and collective beliefs and assumptions about students&#65533; learning and their classroom practice. The content and form of teacher culture mediated the effects of teachers researching their practice. There are critical and transformational effects when teachers research their practice as part of their core work.  Introducing these teachers to research was not without its difficulties. There were events and factors in the school relating to relationships, structures and processes which hindered the development of teacher research in a culture of inquiry.   Because of the time frame of this study there is no evidence that school culture change is permanent.

Its use has been considered so  important that it is referred to as the &#65533;lifeblood&#65533; of international commerce.  The purpose of this thesis is, through analysing the present regime of  documentary credit established under the The Uniform Customs and Practice for  Documentary Credits, 1993 Revision (&#65533;UCP&#65533;), to identify the rights and duties of  all parties in such transactions and the reasons for the frequent occurrence of  fraudulent activities associated with the documents required under the credits. It  identifies that the present system fails to either encourage or implement  substantial realisation of &#65533;reasonable care&#65533; or &#65533;good faith&#65533; on the part of the  banks, or realisation of the requirement of &#65533;good faith&#65533; from beneficiaries. As a  result, the independence principle has been left without substance, with resulting  huge opportunities for fraudsters to cheat on the documents and obtain payment  without the need to actually perform their duties to banks and buyers.  Such issues have become more acute against the background of an underlying  shift in the allocation of risk between the respective parties to letters of credit.  There has been a depreciation in the value of the primary document of title and  security held by the issue, the bill of lading, with the advent of container shipping.  As the letter of credit system is wholly dependent on the integrity of the  documents, it is being undermined by these developments. This has represented  a shift in the traditional scheme of risk allocation from the seller to the bank. In  practice, banks have taken countermeasures by insisting that applicants provide  other types of collateral, and by subjecting applicants to rigorous credit checks.  Thus, applicants ultimately have had to bear the brunt of costs associated with  this reallocation of risk. It will be demonstrated that the UCP does not  incorporate adequate or clear enough duties to be exercised on the part of  issuers toward applicants, and severely restricts the applicant&#65533;s right to sue if the  issuer has wrongfully honoured. Ultimately, a balance must be struck between  the desirability of protecting the applicant from the beneficiary&#65533;s fraud against the  benefits gained by maintaining the letter of credit as a commercial instrument and  business device. Obviously, there is public interest in protecting both of these  commercial values. This thesis advocates that a mechanism in addition to the  fraud exception must be introduced to safeguard the system against the  ramifications of these changes &#65533; increased fraud.  The thesis is structured into five chapters. Chapter 1 sets out to demonstrate the  circumstances under which the respective risks are borne by each participant in  the letter of credit transaction, and how developments in trade practice have  caused the burden of certain of these risks among the parties to a letter of credit  transaction to shift. Chapter 2, after briefly visiting the historical origins of the  letter of credit and the birth of the UCP, explores the implications of the  dominance of banking interests over the drafting and interpretation of the UCP,  how the UCP has in practice excluded the intrusion of other sources of law and  the general reluctance of courts to intervene by applying non-letter of credit  principles, the implication of the UCP&#65533;s assumption of the law in practice, the  resulting marginalisation of local laws, and the inequality in bargaining power  between banks and applicants that precludes a choice of law other than the  UCP. Chapter 3 explores the independence principle and question of  documentary compliance, why the system is ridden with non-compliant  documents and the lack of incentive and meaningful duty for the banks to check  for &#65533;red flags&#65533; that may indicate fraud on the documents or in the transaction. It  will be emphasised that documentary validity, rather than mere documentary  compliance, should be the focus under the letter of credit. Chapter 4 examines  the fraud exception to the independence principle, the typical high thresholds of  proof that applicants had to overcome to estopp payment, and explores recent  trends towards the gradual lowering of such thresholds. Finally, Chapter 5  considers practical measures and proposals for reform that would help to redress  the imbalance in the allocation of risk identified in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Letter of Credit</field><field name="subject">UCP</field><field name="subject">Fraud Exception</field><field name="subject">Independence Principle</field><field name="subject">International Trade</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Decentralized Architecture for Active Sensor Networks</field><field name="creator">Makarenko, Alexei A</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the Distributed Information Gathering (DIG) problem in which a Sensor Network is tasked with building a common representation of environment. The problem is motivated by the advantages offered by distributed autonomous sensing systems and the challenges they present. The focus of this   study is on Macro Sensor Networks, characterized by platform mobility, heterogeneous teams, and long mission duration. The system under consideration may consist of an arbitrary number of mobile autonomous robots, stationary sensor platforms, and human operators, all linked in a  network.      This work describes a comprehensive framework called Active Sensor Network (ASN) which addresses the tasks of information fusion, decistion making, system configuration, and user interaction. The main design objectives are scalability with the number of robotic platforms, maximum flexibility in implementation and deployment, and robustness to component and communication failure. The framework is described from three complementary points of view: architecture, algorithms, and  implementation.    The main contribution of this thesis is the development of the ASN architecture. Its design follows three guiding principles: decentralization, modularity, and locality of interactions. These principles are applied to all aspects of the architecture and the framework in general. To achieve flexibility, the design approach emphasizes interactions between components rather than the definition of the components themselves. The architecture specifies a small set of interfaces sufficient to implement a wide range of information gathering systems.    In the area of algorithms, this thesis builds on the earlier work on Decentralized Data Fusion (DDF) and its extension to information-theoretic decistion making. It presents the Bayesian Decentralized Data Fusion (BDDF) algorithm formulated for environment features represented by a general probability density function. Several specific representations are also considered: Gaussian, discrete, and the Certainty Grid map.  Well known algorithms for these representations are shown to implement various aspects of the Bayesian framework.    As part of the ASN implementation, a practical indoor sensor network has been developed and tested. Two series of experiments were conducted, utilizing two types of environment representation: 1) point features with Gaussian position uncertainty and 2) Certainty Grid maps. The network was operational for several days at a time, with individual platforms coming on and off-line. On several occasions, the network consisted of 39 software components. The lessons learned during the system's development may be applicable to other heterogeneous distributed systems with data-intensive algorithms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decentralized information fusion;decentralized decision making;active sensor networks;mobile robots</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Signs and symbols represented in Germanic, particularly Scandinavian, iconography between the Migration Period and the end of the Viking Age.</field><field name="creator">Hupfauf, Peter Rudolf Martin</field><field name="description">This research focuses on the analysis of pictorial images from objects of Germanic/early Scandinavian cultures in order to discriminate elements which are only applied for decorative reasons from those which also express symbolic values.    At the outset I introduced an interpretation of the terms &#65533;signs&#65533; and &#65533;symbols&#65533; in order to inform the reader to which extent these terms were applied.    It appeared that techniques, such as the geographical and chronological classi&#64257;cation, traditionally used by archaeologists and historians to analyse objects/artefacts, were not always suf&#64257;cient enough to gain all information which images may offer. Sometimes it seems to be dif&#64257;cult to determine if certain images shown on objects from early mediaeval, central and northern European origin, were created  as a space-&#64257;lling decoration only or if they held additional, probably symbolic, information as well.    I have investigated aspects from visual perception, as applied within the domains of psychology, visual art and design. The methods, as they are introduced in this thesis, can be used as a identi&#64257;cation scheme, applied on objects of great diversity. I have applied them on guldgubber (little embossed gold foils), bracteates and Gotland picture-stones.  Objects of great historical and geographic difference, as well as physical diversity, such as size and material were chosen purposely to create an overview of the symbolic expressions in Germanic/early Scandinavian artefacts and to test the extent of the identification method derived from the domain of visual perception.    A detailed analysis of sixty four guldgubber, found in Lundeborg, near Gudme, on the island of Fyn (Denmark), is placed in an appendix. An analysis of these objects appeared to be particularly interesting because it is not known what the purpose of guldgubber were to the present day.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">signs;symbols;visual perception;guldgubber;bracteates;runes;Gotland picture stones</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/662</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Therapeutic Narrative Illness Writing and the Quest for Healing</field><field name="creator">Brooks, Roslyn</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how narratives of illness become therapeutic narratives. The method is to engage closely with (mainly Australian) texts &#65533; literary accounts of illness &#65533; in order to identify key elements that effect a healing function (healing is distinguished from cure). Textual analysis is placed in the frame of medical information about the relevant conditions, and theoretical perspectives that provide a cultural and historical setting for illness writing.     Bio-medical discourse foregrounds the clinical process of diagnosis, investigation and treatment and relegates the personal meanings of illness to secondary place. The thesis explores ways in which the patient&#65533;s account provides an alternative discourse that supplements &#65533; and at times challenges &#65533; the medical discourse. Illness foregrounds the body, and illness narratives confront the reality of embodied experience. Illness that is chronic or incurable, ageing, physical and mental decline, and the inescapable prospect of death confront the patient with the need to find meaning in experience.    Narratives of illness may serve as ventilation, diversion or escape for the patient. They may provide practical help, information and consolation to family and carers, and others who suffer with the condition. These are valuable functions, but I argue that illness writing may embody more powerful therapeutic elements that transform and give meaning to the illness as part of the individual&#65533;s life story.   Key therapeutic functions identified are perversity, empowerment and transformation. Healing can begin with the empowerment of telling one&#65533;s story. Illness stories may challenge the stigma and the subordination associated with disease. They can affirm a sense of belonging and community where illness intersects with other forms of marginalization. Powerful illness narratives are often characterised by perversity, overturning the assumptions of dominant cultural discourses &#65533; including those that place authority with the medical practitioner and demand acquiescence from the patient. The most powerful therapeutic narratives transform the story of illness into a new story.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narrative;Theraputic;Illness;Writing;Healing;Medicine and Literature</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Britain 1939-1945: The economic cost of strategic bombing</field><field name="creator">Fahey, John T</field><field name="description">The strategic air offensive against Germany during World War II formed a major part of Britain&#65533;s wartime military effort and it has subsequently attracted the attention of historians.  Despite the attention, historians have paid little attention to the impact of the strategic air offensive on Britain. This thesis attempts to redress this situation by providing an examination of the economic impact on Britain of the offensive.  The work puts the economic cost of the offensive into its historical context by describing the strategic air offensive and its intellectual underpinnings.  Following this preliminary step, the economic costs are described and quantified across a range of activities using accrual accounting methods.  The areas of activity examined include the expansion of the aircraft industry, the cost of individual aircraft types, the cost of constructing airfields, the manufacture and delivery of armaments, petrol and oil, and the recruitment, training and maintenance of the necessary manpower.  The findings are that the strategic air offensive cost Britain &#65533;2.78 billion, equating to an average cost of &#65533;2,911.00 for every operational sortie flown by Bomber Command or &#65533;5,914.00 for every Germany civilian killed by aerial bombing.  The conclusion reached is the damage inflicted upon Germany by the strategic air offensive imposed a very heavy financial burden on Britain that she could not afford and this burden was a major contributor to Britain&#65533;s post-war impoverishment.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">strategic bombing;RAF;Britain;Commonwealth;World War II;Germany;economics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journeys in Teacher Professional Development: Narratives of Four Drama Educators</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Michael</field><field name="description">Ongoing teacher professional development is an essential part of the wellbeing of the schooling system and successful outcomes for students. In the past, teacher professional development has been used to describe an often &#65533;top-down&#65533; method of training to meet systemic needs while taking little account of teacher's individual needs. This approach often conceptualises the teacher's life as a dichotomy with the personal and the private separated and unrelated.     In contrast, teacher professional development in this study is conceptualised as a journey that includes encouraging and discouraging turns. The journey is explored through the experiences of two primary and two secondary drama educators using Hargreaves and Fullan's (1992) organisers: teacher development as knowledge and skill development; teacher development as self understanding and teacher development as ecological change. The study focussed specifically on teachers of drama. Of the four educators two were beginning teachers, one primary and one secondary and two were experienced teachers, one primary and one secondary. The teachers were interviewed over twelve months. Narrative vignettes were developed from the interviews.    As the context for these teacher journeys was pivotal, the influences on the teaching of drama in New South Wales were investigated. This included an exploration of the major issues that have influenced the development of drama education both internationally and in Australia.     The concluding reflections from this study suggest that there is strong interaction between teachers' personal and professional lives. Teachers' personal circumstances, family histories and schooling backgrounds all have an important influence on their work as teachers. Significantly, issues related to drama education's history and current context reflected these teachers' classroom realities.    The teachers argue that they understand their professional development needs best and should have influence and ownership of their own professional development experiences. They found aspects of their tertiary training and teacher induction unsatisfactory. The two beginning teachers in this study struggled to survive the difficulties of their first year and both seriously considered leaving teaching.    The teachers describe self understanding through distinct phases of development that are made unique by each teacher's personality and context. The teachers saw subject identity and pedagogy as important to their professional identity. They report that times of crisis often lead to positive changes in their professional development journeys.    The ecology for these teachers was made up of several complex issues that are resistant to change and there were a number of impediments reported by the teachers that arise from their teaching ecologies. Two of the teachers have used a change of context to improve their satisfaction and confidence levels. Two teachers described beneficial experiences with supervisors in the school setting. If beneficial ecological change is to occur, education systems must attend to the needs of teachers and provide opportunities to teach unimpeded by systemic obstacles.    The study calls for changes in professional development and for the recognition of the multilayered nature of the teachers' journey. The study calls for a reconceptualisation of teacher professional development that recognises each teacher's ecology and self understanding. The renewed impetus for arts education will only be successful if the complexity of the teachers' journey is recognised and systemic obstacles are removed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drama education;teaching;professional development</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Male Convict Sexuality in the Penal Colonies of Australia, 1820-1850</field><field name="creator">Gilchrist, Catie</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the moral and sexual anxieties produced by the transportation of male convicts to the penal colonies of Australia. My aims are twofold. First, this study argues that male sexuality lay at the heart of penal and colonial political discourse. The moral anxieties this both reflected and produced directly informed the penal administration of the convict population. This was implicit in the ways that convict bodies were ordered, surveilled, disciplined and accommodated. In this analysis the sexual and behavioural management of male prisoners is considered to be a fundamental dynamic within contemporary perceptions of criminal reformation. Second, this thesis examines the ways that these moral concerns permeated the wider colonial society. Free British settlers took their cultural cargo with them to the colonies. In the context of the penal colonies, they also had to negotiate the specific cultural and social implications of transportation. The moral concerns of colonial society were often played out around the politics of imperial transportation. This is examined through a consideration of the cultural meanings of colonial discourse and the many tensions that lay beneath it. During the slow transition from penal colony to respectable free society, colonists utilised and manipulated their moral and cultural anxieties in a number of political ways. This thesis argues that the moral and sexual anxieties of colonial society were both real and imagined. They informed a variety of discourses that linked the colonial periphery with the metropolitan centre in a relationship that was reciprocal but also antagonistic.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">convict sexuality;penal colonies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/666</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agnostic democracy : the decentred "I" of the 1990s</field><field name="creator">Kang, Kathryn Muriel</field><field name="description">The thesis concerns the dynamics during the 1990s of  political action by many groups of people, in what came to be  called the movement of movements. The activists, who held that  corporations were overstepping some mark, worked on alternative  arrangements for self-rule.  The thesis views the movement as micropolitics, using  concepts devised by Deleuze and Guattari. It sets out particulars of  the rhizomic make -up of the movement. A key point is that the  movement trains participants in decentred organisation, which  entails the forming of subject-groups as opposed to subjugated  groups. The thesis records how the movement was shaped by  earlier events in political action and thinking, especially from the  1960s on.  The movement had previously been read as a push for  absolute democracy (Hardt and Negri). The thesis shows that  reading to have been incomplete: the movement is, in part, a push  for agonistic democracy. More a practice than a form of rule,  agonistic democracy is found where state power is bent on not  moulding peoples into any unified polity. It is found where state  power fosters conflicted-self-rule, so that every citizen may engage  in the polity as a decentred "I".  The thesis throws light on relations between the movement  and the constitutionalist state. Part of the movement, while cynical about the existing form of state rule, wears a mask of obedience to  constituted authority. When one upholds the fiction of legitimate rule, one can use the fiction as a restraint on the cynics-in-power. The play creates a shadow social contract, producing detente within the polity and within the &#65533;I.&#65533; The thesis also reports on a search in mainstream cinema for some expression of the movement's dynamics. The search leads to a cycle of thrillers, set in a nonfiction frame story about a coverup  of gross abuse of state power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">absolute democracy;agonistic democracy;cinema and politics;deleuzoguattarian concepts;political cynicism;social movements</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Community Participation in Ecotourism Development in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Leksakundilok, Anucha</field><field name="description">Ecotourism emerged as an alternative form of tourism in the 1990s to mitigate the faults of conventional (mass) tourism in meeting the needs of sustainable development. It has since become widespread in Thailand and is adopted not only in natural areas but also in rural communities. Key elements of ecotourism include a focus on ecological resources, sustainable management, environmental education, and community participation. Community participation receives a high degree of consideration among developers in Thailand. Ecotourism (ET) is seen to support this concept and is increasingly geared in the direction of social development. These trends form the backdrop to this study on community participation in ecotourism development.  The study applies a triangulation methodology to collect data by combining both qualitative and quantitative methods, combining theory and empirical study to analyse the context of how local people have participated in ecotourism development. The study pays particular attention to the practices and opinions of local people in recognition of communities' rights and responsibilities in controlling their own development. The empirical study was carried out at two levels, including a general survey by postal questionnaire (thirty-one respondents) and in-depth study in four areas (Umphang, Khiriwong, Sasom and Tha Madua). The research merges theory and practice into an analysis and empirical presentation throughout the study. Theoretically, the thesis is informed by political economy and political ecology approaches, together with the concept of participation in community development and tourism development models.  The research found that many communities achieve a degree of self-management in offering tourism services such as homestays, guided tours, cultural performances and cultural products. Community ecotourism organisations have been established in most communities in order to serve these new activities and to create a collective management process. Similarities in pattern and differentiation in practices among many communities were supported by different outside initiatives, developed according to similar aims and involving similar processes, but there is no uniformity or single model that is effectively applied to all communities. One significant barrier for local communities to take a major role in ecotourism is the access to ecotourism resources, which are mostly located in protected areas and are controlled by state agencies. This has led them to promote primarily their own cultural resources. Consequently, these practical changes have led to a transformation of the dominant development concept from Ecotourism (ET) to Community-based Ecotourism (CBET).  Results also show that most practices involve a level of cooperation in decision-making and action with other stakeholders who are in a better position to run tourism businesses. It is difficult for local communities to be empowered to control the whole situation, which is sometimes claimed to be the ultimate goal level of local participation. The demands of marketing and conflict in management among local people, together with the limitations in accessing natural resources, are the weakest points of and constraints on the communities. To deal with these limitations, communities try to create relationships with outsiders. To develop better management of community tourism, many communities rely on help and support from outside, especially from government agencies. This, however, impels the community to become dependent on outsiders. It is also hard for communities to generate a high level of income offering basic services, since there are many levels of demand from different types of ecotourists.  In summary, the main contributions of this study are: an understanding of community tourism in Thailand; the experiences of ecotourism development in the community from the leading case studies; directions, roles and responsibilities of actors and community organisations in particular; a range of options for community action in support of a more participatory process in ecotourism development. Last but not least is a set of recommendations for community-based ecotourism development from the level of policy application to practical improvement at the community level.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Community Participation;Ecotourism;Thailand;Community-based Ecotourism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/668</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic Dentistry and its Application in Age Estimation from the Teeth using a Modified Demirjian System</field><field name="creator">Blenkin, Matthew Robert Barclay</field><field name="description">The estimation of age at time of death is often an important step in the identification of human remains.  If this age can be accurately estimated, it will significantly narrow the field of possible identities that will have to be compared to the remains in order to establish a positive identification.  Some of the more accurate methods of age estimation, in the juvenile and younger adult, have been based on the assessment of the degree of dental development as it relates to chronological age. The purpose of this current study was to test the applicability of one such system, the Demirjian system, to a Sydney sample population, and to develop and test age prediction models using a large sample of Sydney children (1624 girls, 1637 boys). The use of the Demirjian standards resulted in consistent overestimates of chronological age in children under the age of 14 years by as much as a mean of 0.97 years, and underestimates of chronological age in children over 14 years by as much as a mean of 2.18 years in 16 year-old females.  Of the alternative predictive models derived from the Sydney sample, those that provided the most accurate age estimates are applicable for the age ranges 2-14 years, with a coefficient of determination value of R-square=0.94 and a 95% confidence interval of &#65533;1.8 years. The Sydney based standards provided significantly different and more accurate estimates of age for that sample when compared to the published standards of Demirjian.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forensic odontology;age estimation;tooth development;Demirjian</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fate management: the real target of modern criminal law</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, William Brian</field><field name="description">There are a number of criminal law doctrines that evade the &#65533;doctrine of conjunction&#65533;1 &#65533; the precondition for culpability that the commission of a prohibited act be proven as accompanied by the intention to achieve the unlawful consequence.2  In general, they do so by ignoring, presuming, imputing or fictionally creating either actus reus or mens rea.  This thesis contends that these are techniques which are deliberately constructed to manage incidental harm3 and which, together with the inchoate or anticipatory offences, form a patchwork of methods to supervise the citizen&#65533;s choices to inflict risks.  It further argues that, by artificially converting secondary or incidental intention into malice, the doctrines disguise that modern criminal law has fate-management as its primary focus.   The thesis illustrates that there are significant gaps in this regime.  For instance, the inchoate offences can generally only address direct intention,4 and the outcome-based prohibitions cannot intercept fate.  The thesis also maintains that fictions such as objective and constructive liability offend the rule of law, in that they modify fact rather than place values on it.5   The work suggests that current criminal law is an interim step towards a fully subjective fate-managing law.  It proposes a radical revision to the existing approach: that the core criminal offence be &#65533;conscious disproportionate endangerment of the legal rights of others&#65533;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">criminal law</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incarnations: exploring the human condition through Patrick White&#65533;s Voss and Nikos Kazantzakis&#65533; Captain Michales.</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Jen</field><field name="description">Nikos Kazantzakis&#65533; Captain Michales is a freedom fighter in nineteenth century Crete.

These novels are each essentially explorations of the human experience.

This study reveals, however, that his work engages vigorously with the problem of responsibility in modernity on both the conceptual and methodological levels. In the concept of &amp;quote;  bad conscience,&amp;quote;   Nietzsche presents a "  dangerous and multi-coloured "   alternative to the more monochrome varieties of self-consciousness which ground theories of individual responsibility in the work of other modern philosophers, such as Locke and Kant. The complexity of Nietzsche's approach to self-consciousness allows him to shed light on the range of interconnected practices of responsibility and irresponsibility that characterize modern life. It also raises pressing questions about the possibility and conditions of philosophy in modernity.    In grappling with "  bad conscience"   within the performative structures of his own thought, Nietzsche makes experimental use of methodological resources drawn from both the ancient and modern traditions of Western philosophy. In particular, this study examines Nietzsche's appropriation and "  reinterpretation"   of meditational methods which form part of the ancient philosophical "  art of living,"   and which re-emerge in altered form, in the work of Descartes. In Nietzsche's writings, such methods are used to provoke and reflect upon the passions of "  bad conscience,"   a dangerous practice which involves the risk of exacerbating this "  illness,"   but which also promises to give birth to new insight and skill in confronting the problem of responsibility in modernity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nietzsche;responsibility;Locke;Kant;self-consciousness;Descartes;meditation;bad conscience;passion</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/672</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of the 'Legal Rule' in Indonesian Law: environmental law and the reformasi of water management</field><field name="creator">Waddell, Sarah Kathleen</field><field name="description">In examining the role of the &#65533;legal rule&#65533; in Indonesian law, and in particular environmental law related to water quality management, this thesis questions the often expressed view that laws in Indonesia are sound, they merely fail to be implemented.  It proposes that this appraisal of the situation does not take a sufficiently deep assessment and that a cause for non-implementation lies within the drafting of the laws themselves.  It is argued that the ineffective system for environmental protection in Indonesia can be related to a failure to recognise the role of the &#65533;legal rule&#65533; in environmental law.      A proposition presented in this thesis is that the arrangements for environmental law making in Indonesia lacks a strong rule foundation and, for this reason, it is not capable of producing shared understandings by lawmakers about producing and reproducing environmental law as legal sub-system.  Another central proposition is that Indonesian environmental law has a form and style, which negates the role of the legal rule in environmental management and control.   Despite the changes brought by reformasi, the central position of the legal rule in environmental law and, indeed, the necessary rule foundation to the development of the legal system, has yet to achieve full recognition.  If this situation is related to the system of water quality management and pollution control in Indonesia, it can be seen that environmental improvement will not be achieved until underlying issues concerning the structure, form and style of environmental law making are addressed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">reformasi;rule of law;legal rule;environment;water;HLA Hart;norm;obligation;sanction;enforcement</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a Proximal Soil Sensing System for the Continuous Management of Acid Soil</field><field name="creator">Viscarra Rossel, Raphael A</field><field name="description">The notion that agriculturally productive land may be treated as a relatively homogeneous resource at thewithin-field scale is not sound. This assumption and the subsequent uniform application of planting material,chemicals and/or tillage effort may result in zones within a field being under- or over-treated. Arising fromthese are problems associated with the inefficient use of input resources, economically significant yield losses,excessive energy costs, gaseous or percolatory release of chemicals into the environment, unacceptable long-term retention of chemicals and a less-than-optimal growing environment. The environmental impact of cropproduction systems is substantial. In this millennium, three important issues for scientists and agrariancommunities to address are the need to efficiently manage agricultural land for sustainable production, themaintenance of soil and water resources and the environmental quality of agricultural land.Precision agriculture (PA) aims to identify soil and crop attribute variability, and manage it in an accurate andtimely manner for near-optimal crop production. Unlike conventional agricultural management where anaveraged whole-field analytical result is employed for decision-making, management in PA is based on site-specific soil and crop information. That is, resource application and agronomic practices are matched withvariation in soil attributes and crop requirements across a field or management unit. Conceptually PA makeseconomic and environmental sense, optimising gross margins and minimising the environmental impact ofcrop production systems. Although the economic justification for PA can be readily calculated, concepts suchas environmental containment and the safety of agrochemicals in soil are more difficult to estimate. However,it may be argued that if PA lessens the overall agrochemical load in agricultural and non-agriculturalenvironments, then its value as a management system for agriculture increases substantially.Management using PA requires detailed information of the spatial and temporal variation in crop yieldcomponents, weeds, soil-borne pests and attributes of physical, chemical and biological soil fertility. However,detailed descriptions of fine scale variation in soil properties have always been difficult and costly to perform.Sensing and scanning technologies need to be developed to more efficiently and economically obtain accurateinformation on the extent and variability of soil attributes that affect crop growth and yield. The primary aimof this work is to conduct research towards the development of an &#65533;on-the-go&#65533; proximal soil pH and limerequirement sensing system for real-time continuous management of acid soil. It is divided into four sections.Section one consists of two chapters; the first describes global and historical events that converged into thedevelopment of precision agriculture, while chapter two provides reviews of statistical and geostatisticaltechniques that are used for the quantification of soil spatial variability and of topics that are integral to theconcept of precision agriculture. The review then focuses on technologies that are used for the completeenumeration of soil, namely remote and proximal sensing.Section two comprises three chapters that deal with sampling and mapping methods. Chapter three provides ageneral description of the environment in the experimental field. It provides descriptions of the field site,topography, soil condition at the time of sampling, and the spatial variability of surface soil chemicalproperties. It also described the methods of sampling and laboratory analyses. Chapter four discusses some ofthe implications of soil sampling on analytical results and presents a review that quantifies the accuracy,precision and cost of current laboratory techniques. The chapter also presents analytical results that show theloss of information in kriged maps of lime requirement resulting from decreases in sample size. The messageof chapter four is that the evolution of precision agriculture calls for the development of &#65533;on-the-go&#65533; proximalsoil sensing systems to characterise soil spatial variability rapidly, economically, accurately and in a timelymanner. Chapter five suggests that for sparsely sampled data the choice of spatial modelling and mappingtechniques is important for reliable results and accurate representations of field soil variability. It assesses anumber of geostatistical methodologies that may be used to model and map non-stationary soil data, in thisinstance soil pH and organic carbon. Intrinsic random functions of order k produced the most accurate andparsimonious predictions of all of the methods tested.Section three consists of two chapters whose theme pertains to sustainable and efficient management of acidagricultural soil. Chapter six discusses soil acidity, its causes, consequences and current management practices.It also reports the global extent of soil acidity and that which occurs in Australia. The chapter closes byproposing a real-time continuous management system for the management of acid soil. Chapter seven reportsresults from experiments conducted towards the development of an &#65533;on-the-go&#65533; proximal soil pH and limerequirement sensing system that may be used for the real-time continuous management of acid soil.Assessment of four potentiometric sensors showed that the pH Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET)was most suitable for inclusion in the proposed sensing system. It is accurate and precise, drift and hysteresisare low, and most importantly it&#65533;s response time is small. A design for the analytical system was presentedbased on flow injection analysis (FIA) and sequential injection analysis (SIA) concepts. Two different modesof operation were described. Kinetic experiments were conducted to characterise soil:0.01M CaCl2 pH(pHCaCl2) and soil:lime requirement buffer (pHbuffer) reactions. Modelling of the pHbuffer reactions describedtheir sequential, biphasic nature. A statistical methodology was devised to predict pHbuffer measurements usingonly initial reaction measurements at 0.5s, 1s, 2s and 3s measurements. The accuracy of the technique was 0.1pHbuffer units and the bias was low. Finally, the chapter describes a framework for the development of aprototype soil pH and lime requirement sensing system and the creative design of the system.The final section relates to the management of acid soil by liming. Chapter eight describes the development ofempirical deterministic models for rapid predictions of lime requirement. The response surface models arebased on soil:lime incubations, pHbuffer measurements and the selection of target pH values. These models aremore accurate and more practical than more conventional techniques, and may be more suitably incorporatedinto the spatial decision-support system of the proposed real-time continuous system for the management ofacid soil. Chapter nine presents a glasshouse liming experiment that was used to authenticate the limerequirement model derived in the previous chapter. It also presents soil property interactions and soil-plantrelationships in acid and ameliorated soil, to compare the effects of no lime applications, single-rate andvariable-rate liming. Chapter X presents a methodology for modelling crop yields in the presence ofuncertainty. The local uncertainty about soil properties and the uncertainty about model parameters wereaccounted for by using indicator kriging and Latin Hypercube Sampling for the propagation of uncertaintiesthrough two regression functions; a yield response function and one that equates resultant pH after theapplication of lime. Under the assumptions and constraints of the analysis, single-rate liming was found to bethe best management option.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proximal Soil Sensing System</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Armageddon to Babylon: A sociological religious studies analysis of the decline of the Protestant prison chaplain as an institution with particular reference to the British and New South Wales prisons from the penitentiary to the present time.</field><field name="creator">Macarthur, Melvyn John</field><field name="description">Prisons have been a both a curiosity and an interest of mine at various times in my life. On occasions in my childhood I drove with my parents past the prison at Long Bay, in Sydney, New South Wales. It was a frightening, but fascinating place. My gaze was fixed on the grounds of the prison, both hoping and fearing to sight an escapee.   Later, as a tertiary social work student with an interest in the concept of social control, my thoughts were sometimes focused on the prison. However, it was not until the early part of 1993 that I actually entered a prison. I was then in the final year of my ordinand studies. I had elected, in one of the Field Education components of my studies, to spend time in the Chaplaincy Department of the Long Bay prison in Sydney.  The experience was a very significant one in that it was to raise difficult, but fascinating questions for me about the role of religion and the clergy in the prison.  During my placement at Long Bay I observed much which strongly suggested that religion and the clergy (chaplains) occupy a peripheral place in the prison system. I was also puzzled by the role of the chaplains, and here I refer to the Protestant chaplains, the only chaplains with whom I had contact. From the perspective of one trained in both social work and theology, it seemed to me that the chaplains were performing many of the same tasks, which one would expect to be performed by the prison welfare staff. In fact it was with difficulty that I could identify anything distinctively 'religious' in the role of the chaplain who, it seemed to me, functioned as something of a quasi welfare professional. It was also very apparent to me that the chaplains had a low profile in the prison; at Long Bay even the chaplaincy offices were outside the prison walls. The chaplains were like exiles, an image which stayed with me long after my placement in the prison had ended. These observations presented a stark contrast to the centrality of religion and the chaplain in the penitentiary, the fledgling prison of the nineteenth century.   The chapels in the contemporary prisons, some of which I had seen photographs of, were curiosities. The very prominence and size of the chapel in many of the prisons, both in New South Wales and Britain, many of which were built in the nineteenth century, symbolised the decline of religion from its position of centrality. Religion's function in the contemporary operations and theoretical underpinnings of the prison is marginal by comparison with the penitentiary. The prison chapel is now curiously anachronistic, being used extensively for secular purposes, such as the screening of movies, the holding of various meetings, and sometimes for sports. The liturgical and sacramental functions to which the chapels were dedicated are all but absent, at least for the Protestant chaplains.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chaplain;prisons</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/675</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predictors of Auxillary Lymph Node Involvement in Screen Detected Breast Cancer</field><field name="creator">Chen, Wan Qing</field><field name="description">Background: Axillary lymph node dissection as routine part of breast cancer treatment has been questioned in relation to the balance between benefits and morbidity. The purpose of this study is to determine the association of tumor size, age and histological grade with axillary lymph node metastasis, to determine if some patients could be exempted from axillary dissection.   Methods: The data are derived from BreastScreen NSW, the government sponsored population-based breast screening program. In New South Wales (NSW) Australia between 1995 and 2002, 7,221 patients with invasive breast carcinoma were diagnosed and 5,290 patients were eligible for this study. The relationship between incidence of positive axillary lymph nodes and three study factors (tumor size, age and histological grade) was investigated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Logistic regression models were used to predict probability of axillary metastases.   Results: The incidence of axillary lymph node metastases was 28.6% (95% CI: 27.4%- 29.8%). Univariate analysis showed that age, tumor size and histological grade were significant predictors of axillary lymph node metastases (p&lt;0.0001). Multivariate analysis identified age, tumor size and histological grade remained as independent predictors (p&lt;0.0001). From multivariate analysis, patients with T1a (Less than or equal to 5mm) and grade I tumors regardless of age had 5.2% (95% CI: 1.2%- 9.3%) frequency of node metastases. Patients 70 years or older with grade I, T1a and T1b (6-10mm) tumors had 4.9% (95% CI: 3.2%- 7.5%) and 6.6% (95% CI: 5.3%-8.3%) predicted frequency of node metastases.   Conclusions: Tumor size, age and histological grade are predictors of axillary lymph node metastases. Routine axillary lymph node dissection could be avoided in some patient groups with a low frequency of involved lymph nodes if the benefits are considered to exceed the risks.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lymph node;breast cancer;detection</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Being Affected: The meanings and functions of Japanese passive constructions</field><field name="creator">Iwashita, Mami</field><field name="description">Amongst the multiple and diverse meanings and functions passive constructions hold, this study considers that the primary function of passives in Japanese is to portray an event from the point of view of an affected entity. The thesis identifies three types of affectedness in Japanese passive constructions: emotive affectedness, direct / physical affectedness, and objective affectedness. Emotive affectedness, often referred to as &#65533;adversative&#65533; meaning, has drawn attention from many researchers. It has been strongly associated in the past with the syntactic category called the &#65533;indirect passive&#65533;, but is actually also observed in many instances of the &#65533;direct passive&#65533;. Direct / physical affectedness is detected mainly in the construction here referred to as the &#65533;direct sentient passive&#65533;. This meaning is common in passives in many other languages, including English. The last type &#65533; objective affectedness &#65533; is primarily associated with &#65533;non-sentient passives&#65533;, more specifically with what is here called the &#65533;plain passive&#65533;.     Many previous researchers have claimed a complete and apparently transparent correlation between syntactic and semantic distinctions of the Japanese passive. The present study rejects these direct correlations. In analysing authentic data, it becomes evident that the correlation is much more subtle than has generally been recognised, and that is a matter of degree or continuum, rather than a discrete, black and white issue. To reflect this view, this study proposes separate sets of categories for syntactic and semantic distinctions.      The ultimate aim of this study is to reveal how Japanese passives are actually used in real contexts. In order to achieve this aim, detailed examination of authentic written and spoken data is conducted. Some findings of the data analysis in the present study contradict previous claims, such as the finding of a large proportion of passives with a non-sentient subject and very low frequency of occurrence of indirect passives.     This research also finds that, although more than half of the propositional meanings in the passive data examined are &#65533;negative&#65533;, a considerable number of passives still appear in a proposition with a neutral or positive meaning. Another prominent finding regarding propositional meaning is that it seems to be related to the degree of centrality of the passive subject to the event. With regard to the syntactic classification of passive, in particular, it is observed that the lower the degree of the centrality of the subject of the passive to the event, the greater the likelihood that the passive clause involves a negative proposition.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese;passive;syntax;semantics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of mental causation: An examination of the theories of Anomalous Monism and Direct Realism with regard to their proposals concerning the causal role of human mentality in the natural world.</field><field name="creator">Medlow, Sharon Denise</field><field name="description">One of the most interesting developments in recent psychological theorising has been a growing appreciation of the need for a viable theory of mental causation. Hitherto, the prospects for reconciling what seems to be the uniquely rational character of human thought and action with the non-rational mechanistic workings of the natural world have appeared to be limited or even illusory, and the pursuit of reconciliation of this sort has therefore formerly been dismissed as being either impossible of completion or inappropriate for contemplation. Much of the scepticism concerning the role of causal processes in human thought and action was dispelled, however, by the philosopher Donald Davidson, who argues that not only is human action capable of being caused by the actor&#65533;s thoughts and desires, but that only when such action is so caused, can it be rational.  Davidson&#65533;s proposal for the reconciliation of human rationality with causal necessitation is articulated in his theory of Anomalous Monism. According to this theory, there exists what may be termed an ontological-conceptual distinction between events themselves and the characters or properties that are attributed to events by human observers, and it is through recognition of this distinction that one discovers how mental events, that is, events that are amenable to description in the psychological vocabulary, are causally efficacious yet free from the constraints typically associated with the necessity and sufficiency of causal laws. Anomalous Monism, if it were workable, would therefore resolve the paradox according to which human mentality is at once integrated in, and yet unconstrained by, the mechanistic natural world, by demonstrating the compatibility of the facts of causation with the intuitions of folk psychology.  However, close examination of Anomalous Monism reveals it to rely on logically flawed anti-realist principles concerning the characters of events, properties and causation. It follows from this that the theory itself must be rejected, but the task that it was devised to undertake, the formulation of a viable theory of mental causation, need not be similarly discarded. Rather, what remains is the challenge of delineating an alternative theory, one that withstands logical scrutiny whilst addressing what is characteristic of human mental processes, and thereby what is characteristic of mental causation. The theory of Direct Realism that is derived from the broader philosophical realism of John Anderson provides the materials for meeting this challenge. According to Direct Realism, mental phenomena are relational situations obtaining between certain organisms (including humans) and their environments. As such, mental phenomena are included in the range of phenomena occurring in the natural world and they are therefore subject to all of its ways of working, including its deterministic mechanisms. The particular challenge that a Direct Realist theory of mental causation faces, that of demonstrating that relational situations can be causal, is revealed upon examination of the character of causation to be unproblematic. Furthermore, the seeming incompatibility between human rationality and natural necessitation is resolved when it is acknowledged that, rather than be an inherent feature of thought and action, logical structure is a characteristic of the natural environment that organisms are at times sensitive to, as revealed by its effects on the characters of their thoughts and actions.  Far from being remote or illusory, the prospects for reconciling human mentality with the causal mechanisms of the natural world are discovered in the present thesis to be favourable when a realist approach to the characters of both mental events and causation is adopted.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mental causation;philosophy of mind;direct realism;Donald Davidson;causation;supervenience</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated study of group B streptococcus and human ureaplasmas : the paradigm shifts</field><field name="creator">Kong, Fanrong</field><field name="description">Group B streptococcus (GBS, S. agalactiae) and human ureaplasmas (U. parvumand U. urealyticum) are two clinically and phylogenetically related, potentialperinatal pathogens. Their relationships between genotypes and pathogenesis ofGBS and ureaplasma infection were still not well understood, one of the reason isthat both of them are still short of a very practical genotyping system. In the study,to solve the above problem we developed genotyping systems for the organisms (thesecond section). For human ureaplasmas, based on four genes/gene clusters (rRNAgene clusters, the elongation factor Tu genes, urease gene complexes and multiplebanded antigen genes), we designed many primer pairs suitable for developing species identification assays for the two newly established human ureaplasmaspecies (U. parvum and U. urealyticum). Further, based on the heterogeneity ofureaplasma multiple banded antigen gene (which contains species- and serovar-specific regions), we developed genotyping methods for each ureaplasma species.For GBS, based on three sets of molecular markers (capsular polysaccharidesynthesis gene clusters, surface protein antigen genes and mobile genetic elements),we developed a genotyping system. The primary evaluation of the genotypingsystems showed that the genotyping systems were practical alternative assays forthe conventional serotyping and they will be useful to further explore therelationships between genotypes and pathogenesis of GBS and ureaplasmainfection. In the study, we introduced novel data and tools into GBS and ureaplasmastudies especially from genomic- and bioinformatics-based molecular microbiology(the third section). For two newly established human ureaplasma species, based onthe U. parvum serovar-3 genome, and using the above four important genes/geneclusters, we exposed some interesting problems in the understanding of newureaplasma taxonomy especially in the post genomic era. For GBS, we studied thetwo published full genomes and exposed some new problems or possible future newresearch fields. In particular we found the two finished and one ongoing GBSgenomes were all non-typical and suggest that future genomic project had better have genetic population structure viewpoint. Finally, we suggested that integratedstudies of the two potential or conditional perinatal pathogens, from the viewpointof evolution, would provide a new understanding angle of the pathogenesis of thetwo organisms. Studies suggested that during coevolution, human ureaplasmas(especially U. parvum) became friendlier than their ancestors to their human host(by losing most of its virulence genes); however, GBS tried to increase its invasiveabilities (by getting more virulence genes) to fight against the human host attack.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group B streptococcus;ureaplasmas;integrated study</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis Of Buried Flexible Pipes In Granular Backfill Subjected To Construction Traffic</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Donald Anthony</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the design of flexible pipes, buried in shallow trenches with dry sand backfill. The thesis reports the comprehensive analysis of twenty-two full-scale load tests conducted between 1989 and 1991 on pipe installations, mainly within a laboratory facility, at the University of South Australia. The pipes were highly flexible, spirally-wound, uPVC pipes, ranging in diameter from 300 to 450 mm. Guidelines were required by industry for safe cover heights for these pipes when subjected to construction traffic. The tests were designed by, and conducted under the supervision of, the author, prior to the author undertaking this thesis.  As current design approaches for pipes could not anticipate the large loading settlements and hence, soil plasticity, experienced in these tests, finite element analyses were attempted. Extensive investigations of the materials in the installations were undertaken to permit finite element modelling of the buried pipe installations. In particular, a series of large strain triaxial tests were conducted on the sand backfill in the buried pipe installations, to provide an understanding of the sand behaviour in terms of critical state theory. Subsequently a constitutive model for the soil was developed.  The soil model was validated before implementation in an element of finite element program, AFENA (Carter and Balaam, 1995). Single element modelling of the triaxial tests proved invaluable in obtaining material constants for the soil model. The new element was applied successfully to the analysis of a side-constrained, plate loading test on the sand. The simulation of the buried pipe tests was shown to require three-dimensional finite element analysis to approach the observed pipe-soil behaviour. Non-compliant side boundary conditions were ultimately adjudged chiefly responsible for the difficulty in matching the experimental data. The value of numerical analyses performed in tandem with physical testing was apparent, albeit in hindsight.  The research has identified the prediction of vertical soil pressure above the pipe due to external loading as being the major difficulty for designers. Based on the finite element analyses of the field tests, a preliminary simple expression was developed for estimation of these pressures, which could be used with currently available design approaches to reasonably predict pipe deflections.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Flexible Pipes;Sand;Constitutive Model;Finite Element Analysis;Traffic Load</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/680</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of Planning in Community Building</field><field name="creator">Ziller, Alison Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the contribution of practising planners,  working in town or urban planning departments, to social wellbeing. It is  concerned with what planners do, how they conceptualise the application  of town or urban planning practice to social issues, and what they think  about their role in achieving social outcomes in a place.  The general question is initially addressed through an introductory story  and then via a content analysis of recent regional strategic plans. This is  followed by a review of town planning literature on social issues,  particularly literature concerned with small areas such as villages and  neighbourhoods and which treat urban areas as a series of villages or  neighbourhoods. The work is further advanced by a discourse analysis of  the use of the word community, as a noun and as an adjective, in a series  of planning reports. Recent literature on community development,  community consultation and sustainability principles is also reviewed for  its contribution to the way in which planners address social issues.  On the basis of findings from this work, five research propositions are  developed. These are explored through a survey of practising planners.  The research propositions are explored in a number of questions so as to  search for consistency and establish the reliability of the results. The  same questionnaire is also administered to a class of fourth year student  planners as a control. Four of the five research propositions are  demonstrated by the survey results.  The results suggest that practising planners have a knowledge and skill  shortfall in the area of applying planning practice to achieving social  outcomes. However, the results also demonstrate that most planners  think that community building is part of their role, they have a realistic  appreciation of their skills and are open to new ideas and learning  opportunities. The concluding section of the thesis makes a series of  suggestions for responding to the shortfall and developing planners&#65533;  knowledge and skills relevant to community building.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social sustainability;social planning;social issues in town planning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of glycation and glycoxidation of low-density lipoproteins in foam cell formation.</field><field name="creator">Brown, Bronnwyn Elizabeth</field><field name="description">People with diabetes suffer from an increased incidence of atherosclerosis, possibly due to the hyperglycaemia associated with this disease. Glucose may covalently modify proteins via glycation and glycoxidation reactions. Reactive aldehydes (e.g. methylglyoxal and glycolaldehyde) generated from these glycation and glycoxidation reactions, lipid peroxidation and other metabolic pathways may also modify proteins in glycation and glycoxidation reactions. These reactions can result in the formation of advanced glycation end-products, which are increased in diabetes and associated complications such as atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are the main source of lipid in atherosclerotic plaques, and the lipid-laden foam cells contained within. Modification of the single protein in LDL, apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B) by glucose and aldehydes may result in recognition of these altered LDL particles by macrophage scavenger receptors and cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters; such accumulation is characteristic of atherosclerotic foam cells.     The extent and nature of the modifications of LDLs that give rise to this behaviour have been poorly characterised, especially in regards to modification/oxidation of protein versus lipid components induced by glucose and low-molecular-mass aldehydes. Therefore the aims of this project were to: 1) characterise LDL modification by glucose, methylglyoxal and glycolaldehyde; 2) examine the effect of these modified LDLs on arterial cells by monitoring cellular viability, proliferation and cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels; and 3) examine macrophage handling of apo B from these modified LDLs.    Glycolaldehyde induced more rapid and more extensive changes to LDL than methylglyoxal, which was significantly more modified than LDL exposed to glucose, in the presence or absence of Cu2+. LDL was modified by glycolaldehyde and methylglyoxal in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. These aldehyde-modified LDLs were significantly more negatively charged relative (determined by changes in relative electrophoretic mobility), more aggregated (by SDS-PAGE) and lost more Arg, Lys and Trp residues (assessed by fluorescence-based assays) than glucose-modified and control LDLs. Glucose-modified LDL had more modest increases in net negative charge, aggregation and only significantly lost Arg residues. Under the conditions examined none of the modified LDLs contained significant levels of the protein oxidation products DOPA and o-tyrosine, the lipid oxidation products 7-ketocholesterol and cholesteryl ester hydro(pero)oxides, nor marked depletion of the major antioxidant &amp;alpha;-tocopherol or significant radical formation (EPR spectroscopy). Therefore these LDLs were glycated, but not (glyc)oxidised, and so allowed the cellular uptake of glycated LDL, rather than glycoxidised LDL, to be examined.    These glycated LDLs had no effect on the cellular viability (assessed by LDH release), cell protein (BCA assay), and cholesterol and cholesteryl ester levels (quantified by reverse-phase HPLC) of endothelial and smooth muscle cells. The glycated LDLs also had no effects on human and mouse macrophage viability, protein and free cholesterol levels. However, exposure of macrophages to some of the glycated LDLs resulted in significant accumulation of cholesteryl esters and apo B. The greatest cellular accumulation of cholesteryl esters was in cells exposed to glycolaldehyde-modified LDL, which occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Less cholesteryl ester accumulation was observed in cells exposed to methylglyoxal-modified LDL, but some conditions resulted in significantly more cellular cholesteryl esters as compared to control LDLs, unlike glucose-modified LDL. Macrophages endocytosed significantly more apo B from glycolaldehyde-modified LDL labelled with 125I on the apo B, than methylglyoxal-modified 125I-LDL. Apo B from methylglyoxal-modified 125I-LDL was also endocytosed and degraded in greater amounts than control 125I-LDLs, unlike glucose-modified 125I-LDLs.    The glycation of LDL by some low-molecular-mass aldehydes have been shown to result in model foam cell formation as characterised by cholesteryl ester and apo B accumulation. This accumulation correlated with increases in net negative charge, aggregation and loss of Lys and Trp residues of the apo B in glycated LDL particles. However, the differences in cellular uptake of glycolaldehyde- versus methylglyoxal-modified LDL were not completely resolved and it is postulated that this may arise from the extent or type of products formed on key amino acid residues, resulting in differential uptake by macrophage scavenger receptors, rather than loss of particular amino acids per se. Therefore these studies provide a potential mechanism to explain the increased atherosclerosis in people with diabetes, and a suitable model to examine the potential inhibition of the effects of glycated LDLs. This could provide potential therapeutic interventions to reduce diabetes-induced atherosclerosis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Foam cells;LDL;Macrophag;Glycation;Diabetes;Atherosclerosis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconfiguring tissue banking consent through enrichment of a restricted debate</field><field name="creator">Lipworth, Wendy Louise</field><field name="description">Tissue banks are thought to be an essential resource for medical research in the post-genomic age. Collections of tissue, usually removed in the course of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, enable laboratory-based epidemiological studies to be carried out, linking abnormalities in the tissue to disease aetiology, prognosis and treatment responsiveness. There are, however, a number of technical, regulatory and ethical concerns that challenge those wishing to engage in tissue banking research.     It is becoming increasingly apparent that tissue banking research is not without risk of harms, even though there is no direct physical risk to donors. This is because, in order to be most useful,  banked specimens need to be linked to personal information about tissue donors and this poses the risk of inadvertent disclosure of personal&#9472; particularly  genetic&#9472; information to those who might exploit such information (eg. insurance companies and employers). Furthermore, the long-term storage of specimens, and the impossibility of predicting all potential types of research programs for which they might be useful, raises the possibility that future projects will be carried out that are unacceptable to some (past) tissue donors.     The ethical principles of autonomy and respect for persons demand that research subjects be informed of such risks and of the nature of the research, and that they participate willingly. On the other hand, there is a desire for science to progress unhindered by stringent consent requirements. For these reasons, a debate has emerged in the academic (bioethical and biomedical) literature and in the legal (law reform) sphere over what  would constitute adequate consent. Despite an extensive discourse, it is still unclear whether it is permissible to carry out research on archival tissue that was originally taken for diagnostic purposes and whether project-specific (as opposed to open-ended) consent is required for research on tissue collected today. This lack of clarity is of concern to researchers, ethics committees and research subjects, all of whom recognise the importance of tissue banking research, yet fear that current consent procedures may be ethically or legally inadequate. Thus it is important that the consent dilemma be resolved as quickly and definitively as possible.    Ongoing controversy and regulatory ambiguity are appropriate when morally contentious issues are at stake, and their existence does not, on its own, signal any flaws in the discourse process. There are, however, two reasons to suspect that the current &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate, as portrayed in the academic literature and law reform documentation, is problematic. Firstly, the debate appears to be mired in an intractable  conflict between those who want to maximise personal autonomy through stringent consent requirements, and those who want the scientific endeavour to progress in a manner that is unconstrained by what are viewed as arduous consent procedures. Secondly, the possible practical options (consent models) being generated by the debate are all limited because they are underpinned by a restricted notion of consent as an individualistic, legalistic and static activity, without consideration of any alternative conceptualisations of consent.    Through a thematic analysis of the current &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate in the academic and law reform literature (Section 3), this thesis shows that debate is essentially occurring between those who see individual autonomy (and stringent consent) as being of primary importance, and those who see unimpeded, market-driven scientific progress as the more important social good, which should not be impeded by unnecessarily stringent consent. Thematic analysis also confirms the existence of the two problems described above, and a failure of those engaged in the debate to reflect on, and challenge, the value-level assumptions underpinning their arguments and those of their opponents. It is argued that this lack of reflection accounts for the two problems:    &#65533; Firstly, it precludes recognition of the cause of&#9472; and, therefore, ways of resolving&#9472; the intractable conflict at the centre of the debate. Value-level reflection shows that this is a result of the logical and moral conflict within western liberalism, between two modernist goods: individual freedom and scientific progress.     &#65533; Secondly, it precludes the generation of varied conceptions of consent. Value-level reflection shows that the current range of consent models is restricted to procedures which are individualistic, abstract, static and legalistic, since they are underpinned by western liberal notions of autonomy and scientific progress. This recognition paves the way to consideration of alternative notions of  autonomy, scientific progress and, therefore, consent, such as those derived from communitarian and feminist systems of values.     A conceptually enriched model of tissue banking consent is then developed (Section 4). This model incorporates dominant (liberal) conceptions of autonomy and scientific progress as well as alternative notions of autonomy and scientific progress espoused by communitarian and feminist systems of values. It is argued that this conceptually-enriched model provides a practical solution to the two problems associated with the standard &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate. In relation to the philosophically intractable conflict&#9472; or what is termed the &#65533;modernist dilemma&#65533;&#9472; between those privileging autonomy and those privileging scientific progress, it shows how the two apparently conflicting &#65533;modernist&#65533; goods can both be accommodated at a practical level, thus making the &#65533;consent to tissue banking&#65533; debate more tractable and fruitful. In relation to the restricted range of consent models being generated by the current debate, it provides new insights into the ways in which consent might be obtained such that a broader range of community values can be accommodated. More specifically, it stimulates the construction of a model that 1) involves communities, as opposed to merely individuals, in all stages of the scientific process; 2) is flexible and able to adapt consent procedures to specific contexts, rather than predefining procedures in abstract terms; and 3) is transactional and relational rather than static and legalistic.    This outcome has interesting philosophical as well as practical implications. It shows that despite apparently unresolved, and possibly irresolvable, normative-level conflicts between the two modernist elements of western liberalism (autonomy and scientific progress), and between liberal, feminist and communitarian systems of values, a multi-perspectival, inclusive, model-building approach provides a practical solution that circumvents these normative-level conflicts.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tissue Bank;Consent;Research;Bioethics;Epidemiology;Genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconsidering Late Roman Cyprus: Using new material from Nea Paphos to review current artefact typologies</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Andrea Helen</field><field name="description">This thesis is based around detailed analysis of an assemblage of newly excavated material from the Paphos Theatre site in SW Cyprus.  Before presenting the new work, the academic context into which it must fit is investigated.  This process of re-evaluating past work sets up a framework within which the new material would be expected to fit.  In fact, research on Late Roman Cyprus is not as advanced as might be expected after over seventy years of excavation.  This is most particularly the case for fundamental principles like typology and chronology for the local ceramics and glass.  A review of past and current excavations shows that the typology of Cypriot Red Slip ware is widely used around the Eastern Mediterranean as a dating tool for deposits containing this distinctive Fine ware.  This makes it essential that it be confirmed to be a reliable and substantially correct construct.  Unfortunately, a re-analysis of the foundations of the Cypriot red Slip ware typology and chronology reveals many uncertainties and establishes the necessity for new material from secure deposits to help refine current typologies.  The artefact assemblage from Area Three at the Paphos Theatre provides just such an opportunity.  A combination of a series of sealed deposits, a high density of artifacts and identifiable coins has enabled a comprehensive study to be achieved.  A major collapse, probably an earthquake, sealed a paved street and drainage system in the trenches and this episode can be pinpointed to around the mid to late fifth century by the coin evidence.  Most interesting is the fact that the dating suggested by the coins does not match the dating usually assigned to the associated pottery and glass.  After establishing the reliability of the coin evidence, the study of the other artefacts offers new ideas about the dating and typology of the local Cypriot Red Slip ware, Cooking ware, Lamps and Glass.  In fact an analysis of all the pottery from the site suggests that the chronology of Cypriot Red Slip ware and Cooking ware in particular needs to be pushed back to focus on a floruit in the fourth and fifth centuries.  This is at least one hundred years earlier than current typologies that focus on the mid sixth to seventh centuries.  This analysis provides some reliable fixed points, for both local pottery and glass, earlier in the Late Roman sequence upon which future work can be built.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Late Roman;Ceramics;Pottery;Cyprus;Egypt;Archaeology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathophysiology of normal pressure hydrocephalus</field><field name="creator">Owler, Brian Kenneth</field><field name="description">Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a CSF circulation disorder, is important as a reversible cause of gait and cognitive disturbance in an aging population. The inconsistent response to CSF shunting is usually attributed to difficulties in differential diagnosis or co-morbidity. Improving outcome depends on an increased understanding of the pathophysiology of NPH. Specifically, this thesis examines the contribution of, and inter-relationship between, the brain parenchyma and CSF circulation in the pathophysiology of NPH.   Of the four core studies of the thesis, the first quantifies the characteristics of the CSF circulation and parenchyma in NPH using CSF infusion studies to measure the resistance to CSF absorption and brain compliance. The second study assesses cerebral blood flow (CBF) was using O15-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) with MR co-registration. By performing CSF infusion studies in the PET scanner, CBF at baseline CSF pressure and at a higher equilibrium pressure is measured. Regional changes and autoregulatory capacity are assessed. The final study examines the microstructural integrity of the parenchyma using MR diffusion tensor imaging.  These studies confirm the importance of the inter-relationship of the brain parenchyma and CSF circulation. NPH symptomatology and its relationship to the observed regional CBF reductions in the basal ganglia and thalamus are discussed. Regional CBF reductions with increased CSF pressure and the implications for autoregulatory capacity in NPH are considered. The reduction in CBF when CSF was increased was most striking in the periventricular regions. In addition, periventricular structures demonstrated increased diffusivity and decreased anisotropy. The relationship between these changes and mechanisms such as transependymal CSF passage are reviewed.  The findings of this thesis support a role of both the CSF circulation and the brain parenchyma in the pathophysiology of NPH. The results have implications for the approach to the management of patients with NPH.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">normal pressure hydrocephalus;cerebral blood flow;diffusion MR Imaging;Cerebrospiral fluid</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mapping the proteome of Streptococcus gordonii</field><field name="creator">Macarthur, Deborah Jane</field><field name="description">Streptococcus gordonii is a primary coloniser of the tooth surface where it efficiently  ferments carbohydrates at pH levels above 6.0. By not being able to maintain the pH  of dental plaque to a level required for enamel dissolution, the dominance of S.  gordonii in dental plaque is considered a sign of a healthy oral cavity. However,  upon entering the bloodstream and encountering a rise in pH, S. gordonii may  become pathogenic, being one of the major causative organisms associated with  infective endocarditis. Proteome analyses of S. gordonii grown at steady state in a  chemostat allowed the phenotypic changes associated with alterations in pH levels  characteristic of these two environments to be determined.  As an initial starting point to this study, a two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-  DE) reference map of S. gordonii grown at pH 7.0 was produced. Although only  50% of the S gordonii genome was available in an annotated form during the course  of this study, the closely related Streptococcus pneumoniae genome (with which S.  gordonii shares 97.24% DNA sequence homology) had been completed in 2001.  The use of both of these databases allowed many of the S. gordonii proteins to be  identified by mass spectrometry. Four hundred and seventy six protein spots,  corresponding to 250 different proteins, or 12.5% of the S. gordonii proteome, were  identified, giving rise to the first comprehensive proteome reference map of this oral  bacterium. Of the 250 different proteins, 196 were of cellular origin while 68 were  identified from the extracellular milieu. Only 14 proteins were common to both  compartments. Of particular interest among the 54 uniquely identified extracellular  proteins was a homologue of a peptidoglycan hydrolase that has been associated with  virulence in S. pneumoniae.  Among the other proteins identified were ones involved in transport and binding,  energy metabolism, translation, transformation, stress response and virulence.  Twelve cell envelope proteins were identified as well as 25 others that were  predicted to have a membrane association based on the presence of at least one  transmembrane domain. The study also confirmed the existence of 38 proteins  previously designated as &#65533;hypothetical&#65533; or with no known function. Mass spectral    data for over 1000 protein spots were accumulated and archived for future analysis  when sequencing of the S. gordonii genome is finally completed.  Following the mapping of the proteome of S. gordonii, alterations in protein  spots associated with growth of the bacterium at pH intervals of 0.5 units in the pH  range 5.5 - 7.5 were determined. Only 16 protein spots were shown to be  significantly altered in their level of expression despite the range of pH studied.  Among the differentially expressed proteins was a manganese-dependent inorganic  pyrophosphatase (PpaC), which regulates expression of adhesins required for  coaggregation. The expression of PpaC was highest at pH 6.5 - 7.0, the pH of a  healthy oral cavity, indicating that PpaC may play an important part in dental plaque  formation.  Another differentially expressed protein was the heat-inducible transcription  repressor (HrcA). Alterations in HrcA were consistent with its role as a negative  repressor in regulating heat-shock proteins at low pH, even though no changes in the  level of heat-shock proteins were observed as the pH declined. This result gave rise  to the hypothesis that the possible reason cariogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus  mutans, can out compete S. gordonii at low pH might simply be due to their ability to  manipulate their proteome in a complex manner for survival and persistence at low  pH, unlike S. gordonii. This may imply some prevailing level of genetic regulation  that is missing in S. gordonii.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chemostat;dental plaque;environmental pH;infective endocarditis;mass spectometry;oral ecology;proteome proteomics;Streptococcus gordonii</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Modelling, Measurement and Control of Co-rotating Twin-Screw Extruders</field><field name="creator">Elsey, Justin Rae</field><field name="description">Co-rotating twin-screw extruders are unique and versatile machines that are used widely in the plastics and food processing industries. Due to the large number of operating variables and design parameters available for manipulation and the complex interactions between them, it cannot be claimed that these extruders are currently being optimally utilised. The most significant improvement to the field of twin-screw extrusion would be through the provision of a generally applicable dynamic process model that is both computationally inexpensive and accurate. This would enable product design, process optimisation and process controller design to be performed cheaply and more thoroughly on a computer than can currently be achieved through experimental trials. This thesis is divided into three parts: dynamic modelling, measurement and control. The first part outlines the development of a dynamic model of the extrusion process which satisfies the above mentioned criteria. The dynamic model predicts quasi-3D spatial profiles of the degree of fill, pressure, temperature, specific mechanical energy input and concentrations of inert and reacting species in the extruder. The individual material transport models which constitute the dynamic model are examined closely for their accuracy and computational efficiency by comparing candidate models amongst themselves and against full 3D finite volume flow models. Several new modelling approaches are proposed in the course of this investigation. The dynamic model achieves a high degree of simplicity and flexibility by assuming a slight compressibility in the process material, allowing the pressure to be calculated directly from the degree of over-fill in each model element using an equation of state. Comparison of the model predictions with dynamic temperature, pressure and residence time distribution data from an extrusion cooking process indicates a good predictive capability. The model can perform dynamic step-change calculations for typical screw configurations in approximately 30 seconds on a 600 MHz Pentium 3 personal computer. The second part of this thesis relates to the measurement of product quality attributes of extruded materials. A digital image processing technique for measuring the bubble size distribution in extruded foams from cross sectional images is presented. It is recognised that this is an important product quality attribute, though difficult to measure accurately with existing techniques. The present technique is demonstrated on several different products. A simulation study of the formation mechanism of polymer foams is also performed. The measurement of product quality attributes such as bulk density and hardness in a manner suitable for automatic control is also addressed. This is achieved through the development of an acoustic sensor for inferring product attributes using the sounds emanating from the product as it leaves the extruder. This method is found to have good prediction ability on unseen data. The third and final part of this thesis relates to the automatic control of product quality attributes using multivariable model predictive controllers based on both direct and indirect control strategies. In the given case study, indirect control strategies, which seek to regulate the product quality attributes through the control of secondary process indicators such as temperature and pressure, are found to cause greater deviations in product quality than taking no corrective control action at all. Conversely, direct control strategies are shown to give tight control over the product quality attributes, provided that appropriate product quality sensors or inferential estimation techniques are available.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">twin-screw extrusion;extruder geometry;dynamic modelling;process control;acoustic sensors;image analysis;bubble growth</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multicultural futures: The negotiation of identity amongst second generation Iranians of Muslim and Bah&#225;i background  In Sydney, London and Vancouver</field><field name="creator">McAuliffe, Cameron Brian</field><field name="description">n/a</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Iran</field><field name="subject">Iranian</field><field name="subject">Muslim</field><field name="subject">Bah&#225;i</field><field name="subject">transnationalism</field><field name="subject">diaspora</field><field name="subject">second generation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Perioperative Sleep and Breathing</field><field name="creator">Loadsman, John Anthony</field><field name="description">Sleep disruption has been implicated in morbidity after major surgery since 1974. Sleep-related upper airway obstruction has been associated with death after upper airway surgery and profound episodic hypoxaemia in the early postoperative period. There is also evidence for a rebound in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep that might be contributing to an increase in episodic sleep-related hypoxaemic events later in the first postoperative week. Speculation regarding the role of REM sleep rebound in the generation of late postoperative morbidity and mortality has evolved into dogma without any direct evidence to support it. The research presented in this thesis involved two main areas: a search for evidence of a clinically important contribution of REM sleep rebound to postoperative morbidity, and a re-examination of the role of sleep in the causation of postoperative episodic hypoxaemic events. To assess the latter, a relationship between airway obstruction under anaesthesia and the severity of sleep-disordered breathing was sought.    In 148 consecutive sleep clinic patients, 49% of those with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) had a number of events in non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM) that was greater than or equal to that in REM and 51% had saturation nadirs in NREM that were equal to or worse than their nadirs in REM. This suggests SDB is not a REM-predominant phenomenon for most patients. Of 1338 postoperative deaths occurring over 6.5 years in one hospital only 37 were unexpected, most of which were one or two days after surgery with no circadian variation in the time of death, casting further doubt on the potential role of REM rebound.    Five of nine subjects studied preoperatively had moderately severe SDB. Unrecognised and significant SDB is common in middle-aged and elderly patients presenting for surgery suggesting overall perioperative risk of important adverse events from SDB is probably small.     In 17 postoperative patients, sleep macro-architecture was variably altered with decreases in REM and slow wave sleep while stage 1 sleep and a state of pre-sleep onset drowsiness, both associated with marked ventilatory instability, were increased. Sleep micro-architecture was also changed with an increase in power in the alpha-beta electroencephalogram range. These micro-architectural changes result in ambiguity in the staging of postoperative sleep that may have affected the findings of this and other studies.    Twenty-four subjects with airway management difficulty under anaesthesia were all found to have some degree of SDB. Those with the most obstruction-prone airways while anaesthetised had a very high incidence of severe SDB. Such patients warrant referral to a sleep clinic.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sleep;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Surgery;Anesthesiology;Anesthesia and Analgesia;Anesthesia Recovery Period;Postoperative Period</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/689</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Habitat manipulation to enhance biological control of light brown apple moth (Epiphyas Postvittana)</field><field name="creator">Begum, Mahmuda</field><field name="description">Trichogramma carverae Oatman and Pinto is mass-released for biological control of the leafroller pest, light brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) in Australian vineyards. Parasitoid performance can, however, be constrained by a lack of suitable adult food and no information is available on the effect of nectar on the parasitism and longevity of T. carverae. To address this, the effect of alyssum, Lobularia maritima (L.) flowers on E. postvittana parasitism was studied in a vineyard experiment with and without releases of T. carverae. Egg parasitoid activity was assessed with E. postvittana egg &#65533;sentinel cards&#65533; and no parasitism was recorded in plots without T. carverae releases.  Where T. carverae were released, there was no significant enhancement of parasitism by the presence of L. maritima flowers.   Three hypotheses were subsequently tested to account for the lack of an effect:                  (i) T. carverae does not benefit from L. maritima nectar, (ii) T. carverae was feeding on nectar from other flowering plants (weeds) present in the vineyard, (iii) T. carverae was feeding on sugars from ripe grapes. A growth-cabinet experiment using potted L. maritima plants with and without flowers did not support hypothesis one. No parasitism was recorded after day two for T. carverae caged without flowers whilst parasitism occured until day eight in the presence of flowers. A laboratory experiment with common vineyard weeds (Trifolium repens, Hypochoeris radicata, Echium plantagineum) as well as      L. maritima did not support hypothesis one but gave partial support to hypothesis two. Survival of T. carverae was enhanced to a small but statistically significant extent in vials with intact flowers of L. maritima, white clover (T. repens) and catsear  (H. radicata) but not in vials with flowering shoots of these species from which flowers and flowering buds had been removed. Paterson&#65533;s curse (E. plantagineum) flowers had no effect on T. carverae survival. In a laboratory study, punctured grapes significantly enhanced T. carverae survival compared with a treatment without grapes, supporting hypothesis three.  Trichogramma carverae performance in the field experiment was probably also constrained by relatively cool and wet weather. Further work on the enhancement of T. carverae efficacy by L. maritima and other carbohydrate sources is warranted.  Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to investigate whether T. carverae benefit from different groundcover plant species. Ten T. carverae adults (&lt;24h after eclosion) were caged with different groundcover species and a control with no plant materials. Epiphyas postvittana egg sentinel cards were used to measure parasitism and longevity was recorded visually.  Survival and realised parasitism of T. carverae was significantly higher in L. maritima than in Brassica juncea, Coriandrum sativum, shoots of these species from which flowers had been removed and nil control treatments. A similar experiment with Fagopyrum esculentum (with- and without-flowers) and a control treatment showed that survival was significantly higher in intact F. esculentum than in without-flower and control treatments. There was no significant treatment effect on parasitism in the early stages of that experiment, though parasitism was recorded in the presence of F. esculentum flowers for 12 days, compared with 6 days in other treatments. Higher parasitism was observed in intact Borago officinalis than in the flowerless shoot, water only and no plant material control treatments in a third experiment. There was no significant treatment effect on parasitism. Fitted exponential curves for survival data differed significantly in curvature in the first, second and third experiments but the slope was a non-significant parameter in the second and third experiments.   In a second series of laboratory experiments, one male and one female T. carverae were caged with groundcover species to investigate male and female longevity and daily fecundity. Both male and female longevity in F. esculentum and L. maritima treatments were significantly higher than on shoots of these species from which flowers had been removed, and than in the control treatments. Daily fecundity was significantly greater in the intact L. maritima treatment than in all other treatments. Fitted exponential curves for daily fecundity differed significantly in position and slope but not in curvature. There was no significant treatment effect on longevity or parasitism when a male and female were caged with intact B. juncea, B. officinalis or without-flower of these species, nor in the treatment with no plant materials.   No parasitism was observed in a survey of naturally occurring egg parasitoids on two sites close to Orange and Canowindra in New South Wales, illustrating the importance of mass releases of T. carverae in biological control of E. postvittana. In an experiment on the Canowindra site, parasitism was significantly higher on day one and day two after             T. carverae release when with-flower treatments were compared with without-flower treatments. Parasitism was significantly higher in the F. esculentum treatment than in C. sativum, L. maritima, vegetation without-flowers and control treatments on these dates. On day five, parasitism was higher in C. sativum than in all other treatments. There was no significant increase in parasitism in a second experiment conducted on the Orange site.  Coriandrum sativum, F. esculentum and L. maritima appear to be suitable adult food sources for T. carverae and offer some scope for habitat manipulation in vineyards  The adults of many parasitoid species require nectar for optimal fitness but very little is known about flower recognition. Flight cage experiments showed that the adults of            T. carverae benefited from L. maritima bearing white flowers to a greater extent than was the case for light pink, dark pink or purple flowered cultivars, despite all cultivars producing nectar. Survival and realised parasitism on non-white flowers were no greater than when the parasitoids were caged on L. maritima shoots from which flowers had been removed. The possibility that differences between L. maritima cultivars were due to factors other than flower colour, such as nectar quality, was excluded by dyeing white L. maritima flowers by placing the roots of the plants in 5% food dye (blue or pink) solution. Survival of T. carverae was lower on dyed L. maritima flowers than on undyed white flowers. Mixing the same dyes with honey in a third experiment conducted in the dark showed that the low level of feeding on dyed flowers was unlikely to be the result of olfactory or gustatory cues. Flower colour appears, therefore, to be a critical factor in the choice of plants used to enhance biological control, and is likely to also be a factor in the role parasitoids play in structuring invertebrate communities.    Provision of nectar producing plants to increase the effectiveness of biological control is one aspect of habitat manipulation, but care needs to be taken to avoid the use of plant species that may benefit pest species. Greenhouse experiments were conducted to investigate whether the adult E. postvittana and larvae benefit from nectar producing groundcover species. Newly emerged E. postvittana adults were caged with different groundcover species and a honey-based artificial adult diet. The longevity of male and female E. postvittana when caged with shoots of borage (B. officinalis) and buckwheat     (F. esculentum) bearing flowers was as long as when fed a honey-based artificial diet. This effect was not evident when caged with shoots of these plants from which flowers had been removed. Longevity was significantly lower than in the artificial diet treatment when caged with coriander (C. sativum) or alyssum (L. maritima) irrespective of whether flowers were present or not.    There was no significant treatment effect on the lifetime fecundity of E. postvittana.          A second experiment with mustard (B. juncea) (with- and without-flowers), water only and honey-based artificial adult diet showed no significant treatment effects on the longevity of male and female E. postvittana or on the lifetime fecundity of E. postvittana. The anomalous lack of a difference between the water and honey-based diet treatments precludes making conclusions on the value of B. juncea for E. postvittana.   Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of groundcover species on the larval development of E. postvittana. In the first experiment, larval mortality was significantly higher in C. sativum, and L. maritima than in B. juncea, B. officinalis and white clover (T. repens) a known host of E. postvittana. Coriandrum sativum and              L. maritima extended the larval period. In B. juncea and B. officinalis, mortality did not differ from that in T. repens. In F. esculentum, larval mortality was significantly higher than in T. repens.  A short larval period was observed on B. juncea, B. officinalis and        F. esculentum. Fitted exponential curves for larval mortality differed significantly in curvature between plant treatments. Similarly, successful pupation was significantly lower in C. sativum, F. esculentum and L. maritima than in T. repens. The percentage of successful pupation in B. juncea and B. officinalis did not differ from F. esculentum and    T. repens. Fitted exponential curves for pupation differed significantly in curvature.           A similar trend was observed in a second experiment with potted plants. The overall results suggest that C. sativum and L. maritima denied benefit to E. postvittana adults and larvae, so could be planted as vineyard groundcover with minimal risk of exacerbating this pest.  Overall results suggest that T. carverae require nutrients to reach their full reproductive potential and flowers provide such nutrients. Lobularia maritima and C. sativum may be considered  &#65533;selective food plants&#65533; for T. carverae whereas F. esculentum appears to be a &#65533;non-selective food plant&#65533;; both T. carverae and E. postvittana benefited from it. Fruits such as grapes can be used as food resources in habitat manipulation and this merits further research. This result also suggests that within species flower colour is an important factor for flower selection in habitat manipulation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epiphyas postvittana;trichogramma carverae;habitat manipulation;nectar;parasitoid;conservation biological control;survival;fecundity;longevity;vineyard;alyssum;buckwheat;coriander;borage;mustard;flower colour</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Marist Brothers' teaching tradition in Australia, 1872-2000</field><field name="creator">Braniff, John Michael</field><field name="description">Recent Australian academic attempts to define the 'charism,' or distinguishing spirit, of the Marist Brothers' style of education, have been conducted using sociological methodologies and have resulted in findings which are more religious than educational or pedagogical, in content. The present enquiry is more educational in focus and historical in approach.     This enquiry poses a series of questions e.g: Did the Marists who arrived in Australia in 1872 come as the conscious bearers of a distinctive style of teaching?  Did they adapt this distinctive style to meet the needs of the Australian society?  How faithfully did they cling to their founding inspiration? Have they been successful  in preserving this distinctiveness in the face of modern developments in Australian education and in the Catholic Church? Or, is all that remains the name &#65533;Marist&#65533;?     The historical methodology employed uses both recent academic analyses of the Marist Brothers&#65533; Founder&#65533;s work and also of the archival documentation of the Order&#65533;s foundation and development in Australia. It also tracks, though not in isolation, the development of the first Marist school in Sydney, St Patrick&#65533;s, Church Hill; founded in 1872 and still operating, at a new location &#65533; Dundas &#65533; in the more recently-formed diocese of Parramatta. This individual school&#65533;s role in Marist teacher education in early, and more recent times, makes it an appropriate focus.     In summary, the thesis concludes that the Marists did come as conscious disciples of St Marcellin Champagnat, their founder; but that the pristine inspiration had already begun to evolve. In Australia the brothers continued to follow his example in adapting  to the newer demands of Church and State. After Vatican II and the return of State Aid, however, the pace and scope of development precipitated changes  which arguably constitute a break from all but the names &#65533;Marist&#65533; and &#65533;Champagnat&#65533;.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marist Brothers;Pedagogy;Marcellin Champagnat;Marist Education;Marist Pedagogy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The first reintroduction of the western barred bandicoot (Perameles bougainville) to mainland Australia.</field><field name="creator">Richards, Jacqueline Denise</field><field name="description">Almost half of the world&#65533;s mammal extinctions in the last two hundred years have occurred in Australia (Short and Smith 1994).  The western barred bandicoot Perameles bougainville is one of a suite of species that is currently threatened with extinction, surviving only on two islands in Shark Bay, Western Australia.  Reintroduction has been used as a tool in conservation biology to assist in the recovery of threatened species, such as the western barred bandicoot.  The aims of this project were to 1) successfully reintroduce and establish a free-ranging mainland population of the western barred bandicoot at Heirisson Prong, Shark Bay, 2) contribute information on the biology of the species, its interactions with introduced species, and its likelihood of persistence as a reintroduced population in the longer-term, and 3) to provide recommendations to assist future reintroductions of the species.  The first reintroduction of the western barred bandicoot from surviving remnant island populations to the mainland, some 60 years after its apparent mainland extinction, was from Dorre Island to Heirisson Prong in 1995.  Animals were translocated initially to a predator-free refuge on Heirisson Prong, and then subsequently released to the 12 km2 peninsula where introduced predators (foxes Vulpes vulpes and feral cats Felis catus) had been controlled, but European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus had not.  Despite a small founder number and high mortality of free-range bandicoots in the presence of a low-density feral cat population, the bandicoot population successfully established.  The reintroduced population of western barred bandicoots provided an opportunity to study the biology of the species, and to compare it with the remnant island populations and other species of Australian bandicoot.  Many population parameters were similar between the island and mainland western barred bandicoot populations, as well as between the western barred bandicoot and other bandicoot species, suggesting that the habitat at the reintroduction site is suitable for long-term persistence of the population.  However, there were some notable differences.  The western barred bandicoot is the smallest extant species of bandicoot, with fewer young per litter than recorded for other bandicoot species, adult sex ratios were closer to parity, animals reached sexual maturity later, and it is the only species of bandicoot where females are larger than males.  Home range size is larger also than recorded for other species.  Some of these differences may be explained in part by trade-offs between island dwarfism, lactational pressures, and nest defence.  The nesting biology of the western barred bandicoot was studied at Heirisson Prong, including during periods of high and low densities of rabbits.  Individuals of the species constructed and utilised nests in a similar fashion to other species of Australian bandicoot, nesting amongst litter underneath shrubs.  The western barred bandicoot appeared to favour particular shrub species, especially when vegetation condition was poor due to rabbit damage, but displayed flexibility in being able to construct nests under a variety of shrub species where at least some surface litter was present.  Grasses were used in nest construction only when rabbit density was low.  Nests appear important for protection against temperature extremes and diurnal predators.  Vegetation exclosures around three of the shrub species most commonly used by the western barred bandicoot for nest sites (Acacia ligulata, A. tetragonophylla and Melaleuca cardiophylla) were used to examine the impact of rabbits on vegetation on Heirisson Prong.  A high-density rabbit population over the summer of 1997/98 caused in a decrease in canopy cover and the death of mature A. ligulata.  Subsequent rainfall and low-density rabbit populations allowed A. tetragonophylla shrubs to recover their former structure, and M. cardiophylla to recover, but not to the same degree.  The flexibility of western barred bandicoots in use of nest materials and their omnivorous diet may enable the species to survive in the face of habitat modification by rabbits.  Population viability analysis was used to examine future options for the recovery of the endangered western barred bandicoot.  Biological data from the Dorre Island and Heirisson Prong populations were input to the computer simulation program VORTEX.  The western barred bandicoot populations were modelled under a variety of scenarios to examine the possible effects of changes in carrying capacity, founder population size, inbreeding depression, and the occurrence of drought and cat predation as catastrophes, on the probability of population extinction.  This analysis highlighted the need for eradication of feral cats, above all other management actions.  Cat predation was particularly potent when it acted through high loss of juveniles, as well as adult bandicoots.  Predator control is considered critical for the long-term persistence of reintroduced populations of the western barred bandicoot.  This study documents the first reintroduction of the endangered western barred bandicoot to mainland Australia.  The population had been extant for four years at the completion of data collection for this thesis, in late 1999 and for over eight years at the finalisation of this thesis in July 2004.  The knowledge gained from the reintroduction was used to discuss management recommendations and future options for the recovery of the species.  The primary concern for reintroductions of this, and other species of bandicoots, remains the control of introduced predators.  For long-term persistence of small, isolated populations, such as those of the western barred bandicoot at Heirisson Prong and the Arid Recovery Project at Roxby Downs in South Australia, and the eastern barred bandicoot Perameles gunnii at a range of sites in Victoria, the complete eradication of introduced predators is essential.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bandicoot;reintroduction;endangered;mammal;conservation;Perameles</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interference Mitigation in Radio Astronomy</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Daniel Allan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates techniques and algorithms for mitigating radio frequency interference (RFI) affecting radio astronomy observations. In the past radio astronomy has generally been performed in radio-quiet geographical locations and unused parts of the radio spectrum, including small protected frequency bands. The increasing use of the entire spectrum and global transmitters such as satellites are forcing the astronomy community to begin implementing active interference cancelling. The amount of harmful interference affecting observations will also increase as future instruments such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are required to use larger bandwidths to reach up to 100 times the current sensitivity levels, and as spectral line observations require observing in bands licensed to other spectrum users.    Particular attention is paid to interference cancellation algorithms which make use of reference beams. This has proven to be successful in removing interference from the contaminated astronomical data. Reference antenna cancellers are closely analysed, leading to filters and techniques that can offer improved RFI excision for some important applications. It is shown that pre- and post-correlation reference antenna cancellers give similar results, and an important aspect of the cancellers is the use of a second reference signal when the reference interference-to-noise ratio is low. These modified filters can theoretically offer infinite interference suppression in the voltage domain, equivalent to that of post-correlation interference cancellers, and their internal structure can offer an understanding of the residual RFI and added receiver noise components of a variety of reference antenna techniques. The effect of variable geometric delays is also considered and various filters are compared as a function of the geometric fringe rate.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interference Mitigation;Radio Astronomy;RFI;Adaptive Filters;Adaptive Cancelers</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/693</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cave Aragonites of New South Wales</field><field name="creator">Rowling, Jill</field><field name="description">Abstract    Aragonite is a minor secondary mineral in many limestone caves throughout the world.  It has been claimed that it is the second-most common cave mineral after  calcite (Hill &amp; Forti 1997).  Aragonite occurs as a secondary mineral in the vadose zone of some caves in New South Wales.  Aragonite is unstable in fresh water and usually reverts to calcite,  but it is actively depositing in some NSW caves.    A review of current literature on the cave aragonite problem showed that  chemical inhibitors to calcite deposition assist in the precipitation  of calcium carbonate as aragonite instead of calcite.  Chemical inhibitors work by physically blocking the positions on the calcite  crystal lattice which would have otherwise allowed calcite to develop into a  larger crystal.  Often an inhibitor for calcite has no effect on the aragonite crystal lattice,  thus aragonite may deposit where calcite deposition is inhibited.    Another association with aragonite in some NSW caves appears to be high  evaporation rates allowing calcite, aragonite and vaterite to deposit.  Vaterite is another unstable polymorph of calcium carbonate, which reverts to  aragonite and calcite over time.  Vaterite, aragonite and calcite were found together in cave sediments in areas  with low humidity in Wollondilly Cave, Wombeyan.    Several factors were found to be associated with the deposition of aragonite  instead of calcite speleothems in NSW caves.  They included the presence of ferroan dolomite, calcite-inhibitors (in  particular ions of magnesium, manganese, phosphate, sulfate and heavy metals),  and both air movement and humidity.    Aragonite deposits in several NSW caves were examined to determine  whether the material is or is not aragonite. Substrates to the aragonite  were examined, as was the nature of the bedrock.  The work concentrated on Contact Cave and Wiburds Lake Cave at Jenolan, Sigma  Cave, Wollondilly Cave and Cow Pit at Wombeyan and Piano Cave and Deep Hole  (Cave) at Walli.  Comparisons are made with other caves.  The study sites are all located in Palaeozoic rocks within the Lachlan Fold  Belt tectonic region.  Two of the sites, Jenolan and Wombeyan, are close to the western edge of the  Sydney Basin. The third site, Walli, is close to a warm spring.  The physical, climatic, chemical and mineralogical influences on calcium  carbonate deposition in the caves were investigated.  Where cave maps were unavailable, they were prepared on site as part of the  study.    %At Jenolan Caves, Contact Cave and Wiburds Lake Cave were examined in detail,  %and other sites were compared with these.  Contact Cave is located near the eastern boundary of the Late Silurian Jenolan  Caves Limestone, in an area of steeply bedded and partially dolomitised  limestone very close to its eastern boundary with the Jenolan volcanics.  Aragonite in Contact Cave is precipitated on the ceiling as anthodites,  helictites and coatings.  The substrate for the aragonite is porous, altered, dolomitised limestone which  is wedged apart by aragonite crystals.  Aragonite deposition in Contact Cave is associated with a concentration of  calcite-inhibiting ions, mainly minerals containing ions of magnesium,  manganese and to a lesser extent, phosphates.  Aragonite, dolomite and rhodochrosite are being actively deposited where these  minerals are present.  Calcite is being deposited where minerals containing magnesium ions are not  present.  The inhibitors appear to be mobilised by fresh water entering the cave  as seepage along the steep bedding and jointing.  During winter, cold dry air pooling in the lower part of the cave may  concentrate minerals by evaporation and is most likely associated with the  ``popcorn line'' seen in the cave.    Wiburds Lake Cave is located near the western boundary of the Jenolan Caves  Limestone, very close to its faulted western boundary with Ordovician cherts.  Aragonite at Wiburds Lake Cave is associated with weathered pyritic dolomitised  limestone, an altered, dolomitised mafic dyke in a fault shear zone,  and also with bat guano minerals.  Aragonite speleothems include a spathite, cavity fills, vughs, surface coatings  and anthodites.  Calcite occurs in small quantities at the aragonite sites.  Calcite-inhibitors associated with aragonite include ions of magnesium,  manganese and sulfate.  Phosphate is significant in some areas.  Low humidity is significant in two areas.    Other sites briefly examined at Jenolan include Glass Cave, Mammoth Cave,  Spider Cave and the show caves.  Aragonite in Glass Cave may be associated with both weathering of dolomitised  limestone (resulting in anthodites) and with bat guano (resulting in small  cryptic forms).  Aragonite in the show caves, and possibly in Mammoth and Spider Cave is  associated with weathering of pyritic dolomitised limestone.    Wombeyan Caves are developed in saccharoidal marble, metamorphosed Silurian  Wombeyan Caves Limestone.  Three sites were examined in detail at Wombeyan Caves: Sigma Cave, Wollondilly  Cave and Cow Pit (a steep sided doline with a dark zone).  Sigma Cave is close to the south east boundary of the Wombeyan marble,  close to its unconformable boundary with effusive hypersthene porphyry and  intrusive gabbro, and contains some unmarmorised limestone.  Aragonite occurs mainly in a canyon at the southern extremity of the cave and  in some other sites.  In Sigma Cave, aragonite deposition is mainly associated with minerals  containing calcite-inhibitors, as well as some air movement in the cave.  Calcite-inhibitors at Sigma Cave include ions of magnesium, manganese,  sulfate and phosphate (possibly bat origin),  partly from bedrock veins and partly from breakdown of minerals in sediments  sourced from mafic igneous rocks.  Substrates to aragonite speleothems include corroded speleothem, bedrock,  ochres, mud and clastics.  There is air movement at times in the canyon, it has higher levels of CO2  than other parts of the cave and humidity is high.  Air movement may assist in the rapid exchange of CO2 at speleothem surfaces.    Wollondilly Cave is located in the eastern part of the Wombeyan marble.  At Wollondilly Cave, anthodites and helictites were seen in an inaccessible area  of the cave.  Paramorphs of calcite after aragonite were found at Jacobs Ladder and the  Pantheon.  Aragonite at Star Chamber is associated with huntite and hydromagnesite.  In The Loft, speleothem corrosion is characteristic of bat guano deposits.  Aragonite, vaterite and calcite were detected in surface coatings in this area.  Air movement between the two entrances of this cave has a drying effect which  may serve to concentrate minerals by evaporation in some parts of the cave.  The presence of vaterite and aragonite in fluffy coatings infers that vaterite  may be inverting to aragonite.  Calcite-inhibitors in the sediments include ions of phosphate, sulphate,  magnesium and manganese.  Cave sediment includes material sourced from detrital mafic rocks.    Cow Pit is located near Wollondilly Cave, and cave W43 is located near the  northern boundary of the Wombeyan marble.  At Cow Pit, paramorphs of calcite after aragonite occur in the walls as  spheroids with minor huntite.  Aragonite is a minor mineral in white wall coatings and red phosphatic  sediments with minor hydromagnesite and huntite.  At cave W43, aragonite was detected in the base of a coralloid speleothem.  Paramorphs of calcite after aragonite were observed in the same speleothem.  Dolomite in the bedrock may be a source of magnesium-rich minerals at cave W43.    Walli Caves are developed in the massive Belubula Limestone of the Ordovician  Cliefden Caves Limestone Subgroup (Barrajin Group).  At the caves, the limestone is steeply bedded and contains chert nodules with  dolomite inclusions.  Gypsum and barite occur in veins in the limestone.  At Walli Caves, Piano Cave and Deep Hole (Deep Cave) were examined for  aragonite.  Gypsum occurs both as a surface coating and as fine selenite needles on chert  nodules in areas with low humidity in the caves.  Aragonite at Walli caves was associated with vein minerals and coatings  containing calcite-inhibitors and, in some areas, low humidity.  Calcite-inhibitors include sulfate (mostly as gypsum), magnesium, manganese  and barium.    Other caves which contain aragonite are mentioned. Although these were not major  study sites, sufficient information is available on them to make a preliminary  assessment as to why they may contain aragonite.  These other caves include Flying Fortress Cave and the B4-5 Extension at  Bungonia near Goulburn, and Wyanbene Cave south of Braidwood.  Aragonite deposition at Bungonia has some similarities with that at Jenolan in  that dolomitisation of the bedrock has occurred, and the bedding or jointing  is steep allowing seepage of water into the cave, with possible oxidation  of pyrite. Aragonite is also associated with a mafic dyke.  Wyanbene cave features some bedrock dolomitisation, and also features low grade  ore bodies which include several known calcite-inhibitors.  Aragonite appears to be associated with both features.  Finally, brief notes are made of aragonite-like speleothems at Colong Caves  (between Jenolan and Wombeyan), a cave at Jaunter (west of Jenolan) and  Wellington (240\,km NW of Sydney).</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aragonite, cave, mineralogy, Jenolan, Wombeyan, Walli, Bungonia, Wyanbene, Tarakuanna.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/694</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Emergent Properties of the Visual Cortex</field><field name="creator">Woodbury, Greg</field><field name="description">N/A</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual Cortex;Topographic map refinement;Artificial Scotoma</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CMC Modelling of Enclosure Fires</field><field name="creator">Cleary, Matthew John</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the implementation of the conditional moment closure (CMC)  combustion model in a numerical scheme and its application to the modelling of  enclosure fires. Prediction of carbon monoxide (CO) in the upper smoke layer of  enclosure fires is of primary interest because it is a common cause of death. The CO  concentration cannot be easily predicted by empirical means, so a method is needed  which models the chemistry of a quenched, turbulent fire plume and subsequent  mixing within an enclosed space.  CMC is a turbulent combustion model which has been researched for over a  decade. It has provided predictions of major and minor species in jet diffusion  flames. The extension to enclosure fires is a new application for which the flow is  complex and temperatures are well below adiabatic conditions.  Advances are made in the numerical implementation of CMC. The governing  combustion equations are cast in a conserved, finite volume formulation for which  boundary conditions are uniquely defined. Computational efficiency is improved  through two criteria which allow the reduction in the size of the computational  domain without any loss of accuracy.  Modelling results are compared to experimental data for natural gas fires burning  under a hood. Comparison is made in the recirculating, post-flame region of the  flow where temperatures are low and reactions are quenched. Due to the spatial  flux terms contained in the governing equations, CMC is able to model the situation  where chemical species are produced in the high temperature fire-plume and then  transported to non-reacting regions. Predictions of CO and other species are in  reasonable agreement with the experimental data over a range of lean and rich  hood-fire conditions.  Sensitivity of results to chemistry, temperature and modelling closures is inves-  tigated. Species predictions are shown to be quite different for the two detailed  chemical mechanisms used. Temperature conditions within the hood effect the for-  mation of species in the plume prior to quenching and subsequently species predic-  tions in the post-flame region are also effected. Clipped Gaussian and &#223;-function  probability density functions (PDFs) are used for the stochastic mixture fraction.  Species predictions in the plume are sensitive to the form of the PDF but in the  post-flame region, where the &#223;-function approaches a Gaussian form, predictions are  relatively insensitive. Two models are used for the conditional scalar dissipation:  a uniform model, where the conditional quantity is set equal to the unconditional  scalar dissipation across all mixture fraction space; and a model which is consistent  with the PDF transport equation. In the plume, predictions of minor species are  sensitive to the modelling used, but in the recirculating, post-flame region species  are not significantly effected.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon monoxide;fires;turbulent combustion;conditional moment closure</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/696</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensing Sound And Space:Auditory And Visual Spatial ImpressionIn Three Auditoria</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Andy</field><field name="description">In some contexts, the experience of sound and space are often considered as two  unrelated experiences. In an auditorium, the senses of hearing and seeing are not necessary  unrelated. This thesis proposes that there is a sensorial relationship between sound and space  in the context of symphonic concert halls. Through a study of three auditoria, this thesis  explores the relationship, and the degree of correspondence and interaction between auditory  and visual spatial impression.  It begins by exploring the concepts of auditory and visual spatial impression in relation  with auditorium acoustics and architectural design. In auditorium acoustics, a number of  terms are used to describe auditory spatial impression, such as &#65533;spaciousness,&#65533;  &#65533;envelopment,&#65533; and &#65533;intimacy.&#65533; These terms have connotations beyond the auditory. The  thesis suggests that they may also be used to describe visual spatial impression in auditoria.  Through textual analyses, the thesis finds that the auditory and visual terms do not  always relate to the same physical characteristics of auditoria and can conflict with one  another. Hence, it is apparent that further subjective analyses of auditory and spatial  impression are needed.  Three chapters in this thesis are devoted to auditory and visual subjective experiments.  Their purpose is to explore the degree of correspondence or contrast, and interaction between  auditory and visual spatial impression. The degree of correspondence and contrast between  auditory and visual spatial impression appear to vary between auditoria and within auditoria.  The relationship between auditory and visual spatial impression appear to be both necessary  and arbitrary, and the degree of interaction between them appear to be strong in some cases  and weak in other.  From the findings, this thesis suggests that the degree of correspondence or contrast,  and interaction between auditory and visual spatial impression could be used to create an  audiovisual experience that suit specific musical events. Concert auditoria are culturally and  artistically unique spaces. Hence, consideration must be taken to understand the relationships  between, and intentions of the acoustical and architectural designs, music and architecture, for  a successful and creative collaboration between designers - since the ultimate goal is to create  an extraordinary audiovisual experience in a concert hall.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Auditory Spacial Impression;Visual Spacial Impression;Audiovisual Interaction;Sensorial Experience;Auditorium Acoustics;Architectural Des</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Slippages .... exploring the aesthetic encounter from the perspective of Merleau-Ponty's ontology</field><field name="creator">Turrin, Daniela Anna</field><field name="description">This paper addresses the aesthetic encounter from the perspective of the writings of  Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the visible and the invisible. It begins with the premise that  from time to time we encounter situations which precipitate a sense of slippage in our  experience of the world.  The paper proceeds to argue that the arts can provide a point of access to this experience,  and that aesthetic theory has, for example, responded to it through the development of  the notion of 'the sublime'. The writings of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and, in particular,  aspects of his text The Visible and the invisible, are presented with a view to augmenting  this aspect of aesthetic theory. Proceeding from a 'Merleau-Pontian' perspective, the  paper explores how the arts can serve to disrupt our conventional sense of space and  time - creating ripples in the substance Merleau-Ponty names as 'flesh' - so as to expose  the chiasm or blind spot in our experience of the world.  The methodology adopted is an experiential one, which draws on the writer's interaction  with the selected works of various artists as well as her own practice in glass.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glass;Sublime;Maurice Merleau-Ponty;Space;Time;Aesthetics;Visible;Invisible;Material;Immaterial</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Image Thresholding Technique Based On Fuzzy Partition And Entropy Maximization</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Mansuo</field><field name="description">Thresholding is a commonly used technique in image segmentation because of its fast and easy application. For this reason threshold selection is an important issue. There are two general approaches to threshold selection. One approach is based on the histogram of the image while the other is based on the gray scale information located in the local small areas. The histogram of an image contains some statistical data of the grayscale or color ingredients. In this thesis, an adaptive logical thresholding method is proposed for the binarization of blueprint images first. The new method exploits the geometric features of blueprint images. This is implemented by utilizing a robust windows operation, which is based on the assumption that the objects have &amp;quote;C&amp;quote; shape in a small area. We make use of multiple window sizes in the windows operation. This not only reduces computation time but also separates effectively thin lines from wide lines. Our method can automatically determine the threshold of images. Experiments show that our method is effective for blueprint images and achieves good results over a wide range of images.      Second, the fuzzy set theory, along with probability partition and maximum entropy theory, is explored to compute the threshold based on the histogram of the image. Fuzzy set theory has been widely used in many fields where the ambiguous phenomena exist since it was proposed by Zadeh in 1965. And many thresholding methods have also been developed by using this theory. The concept we are using here is called fuzzy partition. Fuzzy partition means that a histogram is parted into several groups by some fuzzy sets which represent the fuzzy membership of each group because our method is based on histogram of the image . Probability partition is associated with fuzzy partition. The probability distribution of each group is derived from the fuzzy partition. Entropy which originates from thermodynamic theory is introduced into communications theory as a commonly used criteria to measure the information transmitted through a channel. It is adopted by image processing as a measurement of the information contained in the processed images. Thus it is applied in our method as a criterion for selecting the optimal fuzzy sets which partition the histogram.      To find the threshold, the histogram of the image is partitioned by fuzzy sets which satisfy a certain entropy restriction. The search for the best possible fuzzy sets becomes an important issue. There is no efficient method for the searching procedure. Therefore, expansion to multiple level thresholding with fuzzy partition becomes extremely time consuming or even impossible.      In this thesis, the relationship between a probability partition (PP) and a fuzzy C-partition (FP) is studied. This relationship and the entropy approach are used to derive a thresholding technique to select the optimal fuzzy C-partition. The measure of the selection quality is the entropy function defined by the PP and FP. A necessary condition of the entropy function arriving at a maximum is derived. Based on this condition, an efficient search procedure for two-level thresholding is derived, which makes the search so efficient that extension to multilevel thresholding becomes possible. A novel fuzzy membership function is proposed in three-level thresholding which produces a better result because a new relationship among the fuzzy membership functions is presented. This new relationship gives more flexibility in the search for the optimal fuzzy sets, although it also increases the complication in the search for the fuzzy sets in multi-level thresholding. This complication is solved by a new method called the &amp;quote;Onion-Peeling&amp;quote; method. Because the relationship between the fuzzy membership functions is so complicated it is impossible to obtain the membership functions all at once. The search procedure is decomposed into several layers of three-level partitions except for the last layer which may be a two-level one. So the big problem is simplified to three-level partitions such that we can obtain the two outmost membership functions without worrying too much about the complicated intersections among the membership functions.      The method is further revised for images with a dominant area of background or  an object which affects the appearance of the histogram of the image. The histogram is the basis of our method as well as of many other methods. A &amp;quote;bad&amp;quote; shape of the histogram will result in a bad thresholded image. A quadtree scheme is adopted to decompose the image into homogeneous areas and heterogeneous areas.  And a multi-resolution thresholding method based on quadtree and fuzzy partition is then devised to deal with these images.      Extension of fuzzy partition methods to color images is also examined. An adaptive thresholding method for color images based on fuzzy partition is proposed which can determine the number of thresholding levels automatically.      This thesis concludes that the &amp;quote;C&amp;quote; shape assumption and varying sizes of windows for windows operation contribute to a better segmentation of the blueprint images. The efficient search procedure for the optimal fuzzy sets in the fuzzy-2 partition of the histogram of the image accelerates the process so much that it enables the extension of it to multilevel thresholding. In three-level fuzzy partition the new relationship presentation among the three fuzzy membership functions makes more sense than the conventional assumption and, as a result, performs better. A novel method, the &amp;quote;Onion-Peeling&amp;quote; method, is devised for dealing with the complexity at the intersection among the multiple membership functions in the multilevel fuzzy partition. It decomposes the multilevel partition into the fuzzy-3 partitions and the fuzzy-2 partitions by transposing the partition space in the histogram. Thus it is efficient in multilevel thresholding. A multi-resolution method which applies the quadtree scheme to distinguish the heterogeneous areas from the homogeneous areas is designed for the images with large homogeneous areas which usually distorts the histogram of the image. The new histogram based on only the heterogeneous area is adopted for partition and outperforms the old one. While validity checks filter out the fragmented points which are only a small portion of the whole image. Thus it gives good thresholded images for human face images.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">image thresholding;fuzzy partition;entropy maximization</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dispersal and mating behaviour of Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni(Froggatt) (Diptera:  Tephritidae): Implicationsfor population establishment and control.</field><field name="creator">Weldon, Christopher William</field><field name="description">The Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni (Froggatt) (Diptera: Tephritidae), a major pest of horticulture in eastern Australia, is a relatively poor coloniser of new habitat. This thesis examines behavioural properties that might limit the ability of B. tryoni to establish new populations. As the potential for B. tryoni to establish an outbreak population may be most directly limited by mechanisms associated with dispersal and mating behaviour, these two factors were the focus of this research project. The relevance of dispersal and mating behaviour for control of outbreak populations was assessed.    Dispersal  (i) Dispersal patterns of males and females are not different.  Dispersal of post-teneral male B. tryoni from a point within an orchard near Richmond, New South Wales, was monitored following temporally replicated releases. Application of sterile insect technique (SIT) requires knowledge of dispersal from a release point so that effective release rates can be determined. In addition, dispersal following introduction to new habitat can lead to low or negative population growth and an Allee effect. In Spring and Autumn, 2001 &#65533; 2003, three different strains of B. tryoni were released: (1) wild flies reared from infested fruit collected in the Sydney Basin; (2) a laboratory-reared strain with a colour mutation (white marks); and (3) sterile flies obtained by gamma-irradiation of a mass-reared strain. Dispersal was monitored using a grid of traps baited with the male attractant, cuelure. During the majority of releases, flies were massmarked using a self-marking technique and fluorescent pigment powder to enable identification of recaptured flies. A preliminary study found that fluorescent pigment marks had no effect on adult survival and marks did not fade significantly in the laboratory over a period of five weeks after eclosion.  As cuelure repels inseminated sexually mature female B. tryoni, unbaited, coloured flat sticky traps, and black and yellow sticky sphere traps baited with a  food lure (protein autolysate solution) were used to supplement traps baited with cuelure. The effectiveness of these two sticky trap types was assessed, and recaptures used to compare patterns of dispersal from a release point by male and female B. tryoni. Fluorescent yellow (chartreuse), green, and clear unbaited flat sticky traps were relatively ineffective for monitoring dispersal of sterile male and female B. tryoni, recapturing only 0.1% of released sterile flies. Monitoring dispersal with sticky ball traps baited with protein autolysate solution was more successful, with yellow spheres and black spheres recapturing 1.7% and 1.5%, respectively. Trap colour had no effect on recaptures on flat sticky traps or sticky spheres. Equal recapture rates on yellow and black sticky sphere traps suggests that the odour of yeast autolysate solution was more important than colour for attraction of post-teneral flies to traps. Using the results of recaptures on odoriferous black and yellow sticky sphere traps within one week of release, regression equations of male and female recaptures per trap were found to be similar (Figure 4-3). This is the first study to clearly indicate that post-teneral dispersal patterns of male and female B. tryoni  released from a point do not differ, enabling the use of existing models to predict density of both sexes of B. tryoni following post-teneral dispersal.    (ii) Males disperse further in Spring than in Autumn, but this is not  temperature-related.  Analysis of replicated recaptures in traps baited with cuelure revealed that dispersal of male B. tryoni in an orchard near Richmond, New South Wales, was higher in Spring than in Autumn (Figure 5-6). As the maximum daily temperature was significantly higher in Spring than in Autumn this result was unexpected, since earlier studies have found that B. tryoni disperse at the onset of cool weather in search of sheltered over-wintering sites. Dispersal of post-teneral B. tryoni may have been affected by habitat suitability; it was found that seasonal trends in dispersal could have been influenced by local habitat variables. Low mean dispersal distances in Autumn may be explained by the presence of fruiting hosts in the orchard, or the availability of resources required by over-wintering flies.   There was no significant correlation between temperature and mean dispersal distance, suggesting that higher rates of dispersal cannot be explained by temperature-related increases in activity. Recapture rate per trap was significantly negatively correlated with increasing daily maximum and average temperature. This may have consequences for detection of B. tryoni outbreaks in quarantine areas due to reduced cuelure trap efficiency.  (iii) Maturity and source variation affect dispersal and response to cuelure.  This research indicated that most male and female B. tryoni do not disperse far from a release point, suggesting that an invading propagule would not spread far in the first generation. However, there is considerable variation in flight capability among individuals. Comparison of wild, laboratory-reared white marks, and gamma-irradiated sterile male B. tryoni indicated that mean dispersal distance and redistribution patterns were not significantly affected by fly origin. Despite no difference in dispersal distance from the release point, recaptures of wild and sterile males per Lynfield trap baited with cuelure were highest within one week after release, whereas recaptures of white marks males per trap increased in the second week. This result may offer evidence to support the hypothesis that sterile male B. tryoni respond to cuelure at an earlier age. Rearing conditions used to produce large quantities of males for sterilisation by gamma-irradiation may select for earlier sexual maturity.  Mating Behaviour  (i) Density and sex ratio do not affect mating, except at low densities.  Demographic stochasticity in the form of sex ratio fluctuations at low population  density can lead to an observed Allee effect. The effect of local group density and  sex ratio on mating behaviour and male mating success of a laboratory-adapted  strain of B. tryoni was examined in laboratory cages. In the laboratory-adapted  strain of B. tryoni used in this study, a group of one female and one male was  sufficient for a good chance of mating success. The proportion of females mated  and male mating success was not significantly affected by density or sex ratio,  although variability in male mating success was higher at low density. This could  indicate that mating success of B. tryoni can be reduced when local group density  is low owing to decreased frequency in encounters between males and females.  (ii) Mass-reared males exhibit aberrant mating behaviour, but this does not  reduce mating success.  Strong artificial selection in mass-rearing facilities may lead to decreased  competitiveness of sterile males released in SIT programs as a result of alteration  or loss of ecological and behavioural traits required in the field. The effects of  domestication and irradiation on the mating behaviour of males of B. tryoni were  investigated by caging wild, mass-reared and sterile (mass-reared and gammairradiated)  males with wild females. Mating behaviour of mass-reared males was  different from that of wild males, but behaviour of wild and sterile males was  similar. Mass-reared males were found to engage in mounting of other males  much more frequently than wild and sterile males, and began calling significantly  earlier before darkness. Male calling did not appear to be associated with female  choice of mating partners, although this does not exclude the possibility that  calling is a cue used by females to discriminate between mating partners.  Conditions used to domesticate and rear large quantities of B. tryoni for SIT may  select for an alternative male mating strategy, with mass-reared males calling  earlier and exercising less discrimination between potential mating partners.  Despite differences in behaviour of wild, mass-reared and sterile males, frequency  of successful copulations and mating success were similar.  (iii) Pheromone-calling by males was increased in larger aggregations but  this did not result in significantly more female visits.  Finally, large laboratory cages with artificial leks were used to investigate the  importance in B. tryoni of male group size for female visitation at lek sites and  initiation of male pheromone-calling. Calling propensity of male B. tryoni was  increased by the presence of conspecific males. Females visited the largest lek  more frequently than single males, but there was no correlation between lek size  and female visitation. Female B. tryoni had a limited capacity to perceive a  difference between the number of calling males; female visitation at leks was only  weakly associated with male calling, suggesting that lek size and the number of  pheromone-calling males may not be the only factor important in locating mates  in B. tryoni. The weak, but positive correlation between male calling and female  visitation may indicate that passive attraction maintains lek-mating in B. tryoni.  Further studies are essential on mating behaviour of B. tryoni, including  identification of male mating aggregations in the field, measurement of habitat  variables associated with male aggregations, the influence of density on wild B.  tryoni mating success, and the role of pheromone-calling, in order to optimise use  of SIT for control of this pest.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bactrocera tryoni;density;dipersal;laboratory domestication;lek mass-rearing;mating behaviour;pest monitoring;Queensland fruit fly;sterile insect technique</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/700</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Triage Nursing Practice in Australian Emergency Departments 2002-2004: An Ethnography</field><field name="creator">Fry, Margaret</field><field name="description">This ethnographic study provides insight and understanding, which is needed to educate and support the Triage Nursing role in Australian Emergency Departments (EDs). The triage role has emerged to address issues in providing efficient emergency care. However, Triage Nurses and educators have found the role challenging and not well understood.  Method: Sampling was done first by developing a profile of 900 nurses who undertake the triage role in 50 NSW EDs through survey techniques. Purposive sampling was then done with data collected from participant observation in four metropolitan EDs (Level 4 and 6), observations and interviews with 10 Triage Nurses and the maintenance of a record of secondary data sources. Analysis used standard content and thematic analysis techniques.  Findings: An ED culture is reflected in a standard geography of care and embedded beliefs and rituals that sustain a cadence of care. Triage Nurses to accomplish their role and maintain this rhythm of care used three processes: gatekeeping, timekeeping and decision-making. When patient overcrowding occurred the three processes enabled Triage Nurses to implement a range of practices to restore the cadence of care to which they were culturally oriented.  Conclusion: The findings provide a framework that offers new ways of considering triage nursing practice, educational programs, policy development and future research.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">triage;decision making;cultural settings;ethnography;emergency nursing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geometric Seifert 4-manifolds with aspherical bases</field><field name="creator">Kemp, M.C.</field><field name="description">Seifert fibred 3-manifolds were originally defined and classified by Seifert. Scott gives a survey of results connected with these classical Seifert spaces, in particular he shows they correspond to 3-manifolds having one of six of the eight 3-dimensional geometries (in the sense of Thurston). Essentially, a classical Seifert manifold is a S1-bundle over a 2-orbifold. More generally, a Seifert manifold is the total space of a bundle over a 2-orbifold with flat fibres. It is natural to ask if these generalised Seifert manifolds describe geometries of higher dimension. Ue has considered the geometries of orientable Seifert 4-manifolds (which have general fibre a torus). He proves that (with a finite number of exceptions orientable manifolds of eight of the 4-dimensional geometries are Seifert fibred. However, Seifert manifolds with a hyperbolic base are not necessarily geometric. In this paper, we seek to extend Ue's work to the non-orientable case.      Firstly, we will show that Seifert spaces over an aspherical base are determined (up to fibre preserving homeomorphism) by their fundamental group sequence. Furthermore when the base is hyperbolic, a Seifert space is determined (up to fibre preserving homeomorphism) by its fundamental group. This generalises the work of Zieschang, who assumed the base has no reflector curves, the fibre was a torus and that a monodromy of a loop surrounding a cone point is trivial. Then we restrict to the 4 dimensional case and find necessary and sufficient conditions for Seifert 4 manifolds over hyperbolic or Euclidean orbifolds to be geometric in the sense of Thurston. Ue proved that orientable Seifert 4-manifolds with hyperbolic base are geometric if and only if the monodromies are periodic, and we will prove that we can drop the orientable condition. Ue also proved that orientable Seifert 4-manifolds with a Euclidean base are always geometric, and we will again show the orientable assumption is unnecessary.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">seifert manifold</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hopeful Politics: The Interregnum Utopias</field><field name="creator">Hayduk, Ulf Christoph</field><field name="description">The period of English history between the second Civil War and the Restoration opened up seemingly unlimited possibilities for shaping the country&#65533;s future. The period likewise witnessed an unprecedented surge of political imagination, a development which is particularly visible in Interregnum utopianism. More than ever before, utopianism orientates itself to a hopeful and expectant reality. It is no longer fictional or contemplative. Its ambitions and fulfilment are political; there is a drive towards active political participation. Utopianism reshapes its former boundaries and reinvents itself as reality utopianism. Considering this new reality-orientated identity, the utopias of the 1650s are especially useful in providing an insight into the political imagination of this period. This thesis studies three reality utopias of the 1650s: Winstanley&#65533;s The Law of Freedom, Harrington&#65533;s Oceana and Hobbes&#65533;s Leviathan. Each work represents a uniquely different utopian vision: Winstanley imagines an agrarian communism, Harrington revives classical republicanism, and Hobbes stresses absolute sovereignty. These three different utopian visions not only illustrate the range of the political imagination; they provide an opportunity to examine different ways to deal with the existing political and social concerns of the Interregnum and different perspectives for ideal solutions. Interregnum utopianism is shaped by the expectations and violence of the English Revolution and accordingly it is characterised by the heightened hopes and fears of its time. Despite substantial differences in the three utopias, the elemental hopes and fears expressed in these works remain similar. The hope for change and a better future is negotiated textually with a fear of anarchy and violence. In the end a compromise between opportunity and security has to be found. It is this compromise that shapes the face of Interregnum utopianism and reflects a major aspect of the post-revolutionary political imagination in England.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Utopia;Hobbes;Winstanley;Harrington;Leviathan;Oceana;English Interregnum;English Civil War;English Republic</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular typing and evolution of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</field><field name="creator">Hu, Honghua</field><field name="description">Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is a common cause of salmonellosis among humans and animals worldwide. In Australia, Typhimurium is responsible for over half of the salmonellosis cases. The Anderson phage-typing scheme is the primary means of long-term surveillance of Typhimurium outbreak isolates, and has played an important role in epidemiology. However, there exist quite a number of strains of Typhimurium that cannot be defined by the phage-typing scheme. Furthermore, the knowledge of evolutionary relationships among isolates of different phage types is still very limited and the genetic basis of phage type variation remains largely unknown. To address these issues, this study focused on molecular typing and evolution of Typhimurium.  Fluorescent amplified-fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was applied to 46 Typhimurium isolates comprising nine phage types in Australia using the restriction enzymes MseI and EcoRI and MseI +1 / EcoRI +1 primer pair combinations. The selected phage types, DT9, DT135, DT64, DT44, DT126, DT12a, DT1, DT141 and DT108, have been dominant or frequent phage types in animal and human infections in Australia in recent years. AFLP in the present study showed a very good discrimination power with Simpson index of diversity of 0.98, 35 different AFLP patterns were observed in the 46 isolates studied. The tree based on AFLP patterns showed good correlation with phage type, grouped most Typhimurium isolates by phage type, and differentiated all nine phage types. Furthermore, 84 phage-type specific polymorphic AFLP fragments, for which presence or absence correlated with phage type (including 25 with one exception to phage-type specificity) were observed in the 46 strains studied.   Eighteen phage-type specific AFLP fragments were cloned and sequenced. Sixteen are of known genes or have a homologue in the databases. It was found a predominance of phage and plasmid genes rather than mutational changes in the AFLP fragments studied. Of the 18 cloned and sequenced AFLP fragments, only four relate to mutational changes in the S. enterica chromosome, the other 14 comprise DNA of mobile elements: nine are phage related, three are plasmid related and two are gain of DNA from unknown origin.   Twelve of the 18 sequenced phage-type specific AFLP markers are polymorphic because the DNA is present or absent as indicated by Southern hybridization. Two of these markers were successfully used in preliminary PCR-based typing of 30 DT9 and 29 DT135 isolates from worldwide collections. 27 of the 30 DT9 isolates and all DT135 isolates tested were correctly categorized. The results implied a good potential to use the sequence of these fragments as the basis for a multiplex PCR or a microarray based molecular &#65533;phage&#65533; typing method for Typhimurium.  This thesis also studied the molecular evolutionary relationships among the same set of 46 Typhimurium isolates using mutational changes detected by AFLP, or analysis of intergenic regions and their flanking genes in genome sequences. The complete genome sequence of Typhimurium LT2 was analysed by computer modelled AFLP. The polymorphic AFLP fragments, which matched with the modelled LT2 AFLP fragments, were amplified and sequenced by LT2 genome based primers to determine the changes. Forty-nine intergenic regions with higher pairwise differences between LT2 and Typhi CT18 were amplified and sequenced using LT2 genome based primers for one isolate of each phage type. 51 polymorphic sites were detected consisting of 18 in AFLP fragments and 33 in intergenic regions or their flanking genes. PCR-RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) and SNaPshot were used to further investigate the distribution of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected in intergenic regions in all isolates studied.  Of the 18 mutational changes detected in AFLP fragments, eight were indels (insertions / deletions) and ten single base substitutions. Of the eight indels, four were in genes, three in intergenic regions, and one covered adjacent intergenic and coding regions. The four indels in genes all caused frameshift mutations, including three single base indels and one 19 bp deletion. Of the ten substitutions, one was in an intergenic region and nine in genes comprising three synonymous and six non-synonymous substitutions.   Of the 33 polymorphic sites detected from sequences of 23 intergenic regions and their flanking genes, one was IS200 insertion and 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 30 were single base substitutions and two were single base indels. Nine of the 33 variations were found in the flanking genes, which were all single base substitutions comprising four synonymous, four non-synonymous substitutions and one non-sense mutation.   More non-synonymous than synonymous substitutions were found for those in coding regions within Typhimurium, indicating that slightly deleterious intraspecies mutations can be fixed within clones, such as various lineages of Typhimurium.  The 51 polymorphic sites, which were inferred from sequences of both mutation related AFLP fragments, and intergenic regions and their flanking genes, gave a single phylogenetic tree of the 46 Typhimurium isolates studied. All sequences involved were compared with the homologous sequences in the available S. enterica genome sequences for serovars Typhi, Paratyphi A, Gallinarum, Enteritidis and Pullorum and this enabled the determination of the direction of the mutational changes in the isolates studied and the root of the phylogenetic tree. There were only two events inferred to have occurred twice, the remaining 49 polymorphisms can be explained by a single event. The data indicated that Typhimurium has a very strong clonal structure with a very low level of recombination over the time for diversification of Typhimurium as majority of clonal variations are from point mutations rather than recombination.  The phylogenetic tree based on mutational changes showed that most Typhimurium isolates of a given phage type are in the same evolutionary group, but that some phage types appear to have arisen more than once. Comparison of the phylogenetic tree with AFLP data gave examples of unrelated isolates of a given phage type having common AFLP fragments comprising plasmid or phage genes, supporting the view that phage type can be determined by presence of specific phages or plasmids. The mutation-based tree showed that six of the nine phage types studied appeared to have a single origin, at least for the isolates studied. It also found that DT1 and DT44 had two independent origins even for the limited set of strains used. The distribution of DT12a isolates into two groups could be explained that the group of three DT12a isolates were derived from the other group of four DT12a isolates, where the root of the tree might be. The data also confirmed that DT64 arose from DT9.  The phylogenetic tree that was generated based on essentially mutational changes provides clear relationships of the closely related Typhimurium isolates with high level of consistency and reasonable confidence. This study provided one of the few analyses of relationships of isolates within a clone. Matching actual AFLP with computer modeled AFLP and sequencing intergenic regions provide very good new strategies to identify mutational polymorphisms and to study the molecular evolutionary relationships in the closely related isolates.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Molecular typing;Molecular evolution;AFLP;Phage typing;Salmonella;Typhimurium</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/704</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Double Accounting for Goodwill- A Problem Redefined</field><field name="creator">Bloom, Martin Harlod</field><field name="description">The function of accounting is to provide users with useful information in making economic decisions. Information regarding goodwill, a major constituent of the value of many listed companies, is likely to be useful in making decisions relating to those companies.   A historical review of accounting literature, including professional standards, relating to methods of accounting for purchased goodwill showed that none of them has stood the test of time. The current trend towards an impairment paradigm will not resolve the issue satisfactorily because it produces, at best, a partial solution. The difficulty in accounting meaningfully for goodwill is compounded because, given its foundation in historical cost principles, accounting has been unable to present any information at all with regard to internally generated goodwill within the confines of the traditional Balance Sheet. This, in turn, has led to the evasion of the reality that the two forms of goodwill are inextricably merged.   Trying to account satisfactorily for goodwill has been a prime example of R.R. Sterling&#65533;s &#65533;issues conceived in a way that they are in principle unresolvable&#65533;. The problem was accordingly redefined as being to find a method by which the current level of information relating to goodwill in the financial statements contained in a company&#65533;s Annual Report could be improved. This thesis seeks to identify a logically defensible method of accounting for goodwill which addresses the redefined problem. It builds upon the historical research undertaken, combined with a priori reasoning, to propose an additional financial statement which is a modification of nineteenth century &#65533;double accounting&#65533; in a modern context. This statement, which goes far to solve the redefined problem, also furnishes information regarding the company&#65533;s market capitalization at balance date and is termed the Market Capitalization Statement (&#65533;MCS&#65533;). While the idea of furnishing market capitalization data to readers of the Annual Report is not new, it is believed that this is the first time such data has been systematically linked with the Balance Sheet to provide an objective, integrated and meaningful view of goodwill in the financial statements.   The practical application and simplicity of the MCS are illustrated by a range of examples drawn from Australian &#65533;dot-com&#65533; companies over a period of time which saw considerable fluctuation in both goodwill and market capitalization, supplemented by examining data relating to some of Australia&#65533;s largest listed companies over the same period. These examples demonstrate that the MCS has the potential to provide significant information not available in conventional financial statements, while freeing the traditional Balance Sheet and Profit and Loss Account to present information in a more meaningful and less distorted way.   Finally, the MCS is noted as still being subject to certain problems and distortions in the context of the historical cost basis of the remaining financial statements. It is shown that, if used in the context of an exit price based system, Chambers&#65533; CoCoA, many of these distortions are removed. The MCS also complements the information provided by CoCoA as originally formulated.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accounting for goodwill;double account;market capitalization;amortization;impairment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Role of International Courts and Tribunals in International Environmental Law</field><field name="creator">Stephens, Tim</field><field name="description">International environmental law is one of the most dynamic fields of public international law, and has rapidly acquired great breadth and sophistication. Yet the rate of global environmental decline has also increased and is accelerating. Halting and reversing this process is a challenge of effective governance, requiring institutions that can ensure that the now impressive body of environmental norms is faithfully implemented. This thesis explores whether and to what extent international courts and tribunals can play a useful role in international environmental regimes. Consideration is given to the threefold function of adjudication in resolving environmental disputes, in promoting compliance with environmental standards, and in developing environmental rules.  The thesis is divided into three Parts. The first Part examines the spectrum of adjudicative bodies that have been involved in the resolution of environmental disputes, situates these within the evolution of institutions for compliance control, and offers a reassessment of their relevance in contemporary environmental governance. The second Part critically assesses the contribution that arbitral awards and judicial decisions have made to the development of norms and principles of environmental law, examining case law relating to transboundary pollution, shared freshwater resources and marine  environmental protection. In the third Part of the thesis consideration is given to three looming challenges for international environmental litigation: accommodating greater  levels of public participation in adjudicative processes, resolving practical problems  stemming from the interaction among multiple jurisdictions, and ensuring that specialised courts and tribunals do not apply environmental norms in a parochial manner that privileges the policy objectives of issue-specific regimes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international law;international environment law;dispute settlement;international courts</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computational case-based redesign for people with  ability impairment: Rethinking, reuse and  redesign learning for home modification practice</field><field name="creator">Bridge, Catherine Elizabeth</field><field name="description">Home modification practice for people with impairments of ability involves redesigning  existing residential environments as distinct from the creation of a new dwelling. A  redesigner alters existing structures, fittings and fixtures to better meet the occupant&#65533;s  ability requirements. While research on case-based design reasoning and healthcare  informatics are well documented, the reasoning and process of redesign and its  integration with individual human functional abilities remains poorly understood.  Developing a means of capturing redesign knowledge in the form of case documentation  online provides a means for integrating and learning from individual case-based  redesign episodes where assessment and interventions are naturally linked.  A key aim of the research outlined in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of the  redesign of spaces for individual human ability with the view to computational  modelling. Consequently, the foundational knowledge underpinning the model  development includes design, redesign, case-based building design and human  functional ability. Case-based redesign as proposed within the thesis, is a method for  capturing the redesign context, the residential environment, the modification and the  transformational knowledge involved in the redesign.  Computational simulation methods are traditionally field dependent. Consequently, part  of the research undertaken within this thesis involved the development of a framework  for analysing cases within an online case-studies library to validate redesign for  individuals and a method of acquiring reuse information so as to be able to estimate the  redesign needs of a given population based on either their environment or ability profile.  As home modification for people with functional impairments was a novel application  field, an explorative action-based methodological approach using computational  modelling was needed to underpin a case-based reasoning method. The action-based  method involved a process of articulating and examining existing knowledge, suggesting  new case-based computational practices, and evaluating the results. This cyclic process  led to an improvement cycle that included theory, computational tool development and  practical application.  The rapid explosion of protocols and online redesign communities that utilise Web  technologies meant that a web-based prototype capable of acquiring cases directly from  home modification practitioners online and in context was both desirable and  achievable.  The first online version in 1998-99, encoded home modification redesigns using static  WebPages and hyperlinks. This motivated the full-scale more dynamic and robust  HMMinfo casestudies prototype whose action-based development is detailed within this  thesis. The home modification casestudies library results from the development and  integration of a novel case-based redesign model in combination with a Human-  Activity-Space computational ontology. These two models are then integrated into a  relational database design to enable online case acquisition, browsing, case reuse and  redesign learning.  The application of the redesign ontology illustrates case reuse and learning, and presents  some of the implementation issues and their resolution. Original contributions resulting  from this work include: extending case-based design theory to encompass redesign and  redesign models, distinguishing the importance of human ability in redesign and the  development of the Human-Activity-Space ontology. Additionally all data models were  combined and their associated inter-relationships evaluated within a prototype made  available to redesign practitioners.  v  Reflective and practitioner based evaluation contributed enhanced understanding of  redesign case contribution dynamics in an online environment. Feedback from redesign  practitioners indicated that gaining informed consent to share cases from consumers of  home modification and maintenance services, in combination with the additional time  required to document a case online, and reticence to go public for fear of critical  feedback, all contributed to a less than expected case library growth. This is despite  considerable interest in the HMMinfo casestudies website as evidenced by web usage  statistics. Additionally the redesign model described in this thesis has practical  implications for all design practitioners and educators who seek to create new work by  reinterpreting, reconstructing and redesigning spaces.</field><field name="date" /><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing;disability;home modification;functionality</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ECOLOGY OF THE IMAGE</field><field name="creator">Lopes, Abby Mellick</field><field name="description">We know very little about the ecology of our designed world. Contrary to all appearances, design is not about making objects. It is rather about structuring the conditions for life. Design is our second nature, naturalising changes in our ways of living. Yet it also conceals dangers and diminishes our sensitivity to respond to them. The security offered by the televisual image &#65533; and the solace of design&#65533;s promise to remove all environmental risks &#65533; are fictions.  Ecology of the Image is a critical exploration of idealism in design. Drawing on hermeneutic phenomenology, socio-cultural and design theory, it argues that design is not a value-free practice but structures epistemological attitudes into the world. Ideas are material elements of our environments. This thesis offers an explanation of how idealism circulates within the designed world, fashioning our minds, bodies and environments.  The televisual is analysed as a normative phenomenon that inducts us into a way of seeing and understanding the world. Its vision of the affluent good life inspires and gives purpose to desire, and sustains what Manzini has called &#65533;product based well being&#65533;. The thesis argues that the televisual puts us out of touch with the consequences of its vision; it diminishes our capacity for forethought. This results in the generation of unacknowledged, yet self-endangering environmental feedback.  Environmental problems force us to take account of design&#65533;s hidden rationales. Only at five minutes to midnight, for example, do we realise that the stock and supply of potable water is endangered. The problem is not so much this late recognition, but that design led us to believe in water&#65533;s abundance. This situation demands the development of an ecological understanding of our designed worlds that can inform future actions.  The sign, particularly as it has been mobilised in cultural theory, plays a leading role in this design situation and the perceptions it supports. The sign is utilised for its ability to denaturalise appearances &#65533; to &#65533;read&#65533; design&#65533;s claims on the world.  Finally, the thesis turns to the designer-in-training in the process of acquiring instrumental skills and worldviews. It proposes a research strategy that inscribes  environmental consciousness into the design process &#65533; situating the designer in the midst of semiotic and material worlds. Through its observational methodology it outlines ways of first understanding, then of intervening and generating changes in our &#65533;ideal&#65533; world.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">design theory;phenomenology;image;design</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">STATIC SHAPE CONTROL OF LAMINATED COMPOSITE PLATE SMART STRUCTURE USING PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATORS &#65533;</field><field name="creator">Chee, Clinton Yat Kuan</field><field name="description">The application of static shape control was investigated in this thesis particularly for a composite plate configuration using piezoelectric actuators.

The mathematical model represents an improvement over existing formulations used to model intelligent structures using piezoelectric materials as actuators and sensors. The reason is TODL does not only account for the electro-mechanical coupling within the adaptive material, it also accounts for the full structural coupling in the entire structure due to the piezoelectric material being attached to the host structure. The other significant improvement of TODL is that it is applicable to structures which are relatively thick whereas existing models are based on thin beam / plate theories. Consequently, transverse shearing effects are automatically accounted for in TODL and unlike first order shear deformation theories, shear correction factors are not required.              The second major section of this thesis uses the TODL formulation in static shape control. Shape control is defined here as the determination of shape control parameters, including actuation voltage and actuator orientation configuration, such that the structure that is activated using these parameters will conform as close as possible to the desired shape. Several shape control strategies and consequently algorithms were developed here. Initial investigations in shape control has revealed many interesting issues which have been used in later investigations to improve shape controllability and also led to the development of improved algorithms. For instance, the use of discrete actuator patches has led to greater shape controllability and the use of slopes and curvatures as additional control criteria have resulted in significant reduction in internal stresses. The significance of optimizing actuator orientation and its relation to piezoelectric anisotropy in improving shape controllability has also been presented. Thus the major facets of shape control has been brought together and the algorithms developed here represent a comprehensive strategy to perform static shape control.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Smart Structures;Piezoelectric Actuators;Shape Control;Finite Element;Intelligent Composite Structures;Actuator Orientation;Voltage Optimization;High Order Displacement Field;Thick Composites;Electro-mechanical Coupling;Adaptive Material</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defining vocal quality in female classical singers: pedagogical, acoustical and perceptual studies</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Helen Frances</field><field name="description">The technique of &#65533;open throat&#65533; is a pedagogical concept transmitted through the oral tradition of singing. This thesis explored the pedagogical perceptions and practices of &#65533;open throat&#65533; using empirical methodologies to assess technical skill and associated vocal quality. In the first study (Mitchell, Kenny, Ryan, &amp; Davis, 2003), we assessed the degree of consensus amongst singing pedagogues regarding the definition of, and use in the singing studio of the technique called &#65533;open throat.&#65533; Results indicated that all fifteen pedagogues described &#65533;open throat&#65533; technique as fundamental to singing training and were positive about the sound quality it achieved, especially in classical singing. It was described as a way of maximising pharyngeal space or abducting the false vocal folds. Hypotheses generated from pedagogical beliefs expressed in this first study were then tested acoustically (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, 2004a, 2004b). Six advanced singing students sang in two conditions: &#65533;optimal&#65533; (O), using maximal open throat, &#65533;sub-optimal&#65533; (SO), using reduced open throat and loud sub-optimal (LSO) to control for the effect of loudness. From these recordings, acoustic characteristics of vibrato (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, 2004b) and energy distribution (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, 2004a) were examined. Subsequent investigations of the vibrato parameters of rate, extent and onset, revealed that extent was significantly reduced and onset increased when singers did not use the technique. As inconsistent vibrato is considered indicative of poor singing, it was hypothesized that testing the energy distribution in these singers&#65533; voices in each condition would identify the timbral changes associated with open throat. Visual inspection of long term average spectra (LTAS) confirmed differences between O and SO, but conventional measures applied to long term average spectra (LTAS), comparing energy peak height [singing power ratio (SPR)] and peak area [energy ratio (ER)] were not sensitive to the changes identified through visual inspection of the LTAS. These results were not consistent with the vibrato findings and suggest that conventional measures of SPR and ER are not sufficiently sensitive to evaluate LTAS. In the fourth study, fifteen expert listeners consistently and reliably identified the presence of open throat technique with 87% accuracy (Mitchell &amp; Kenny, in press). In the fifth study, LTAS measurements were examined with respect to the perceptual ratings of singers. There was no relationship between perceptual rankings of vocal beauty and acoustic rankings of vocal quality (Kenny &amp; Mitchell, 2004, in press). There is a vast literature of spectral energy definitions of good voice but the studies in this thesis have indicated that current acoustic methods are limited in defining vocal quality. They also suggest that current work in singing has not sufficiently incorporated perceptual ratings and descriptions of sound quality or the relationship between acoustic and perceptual factors with pedagogical practices.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">open throat;singing technique;vocal quality;vocal training;vibrato;long term average spectra;perceptual ratings</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Drug and Therapeutics Committees: Studies in Australian hospitals</field><field name="creator">Tan, Ee Lyn</field><field name="description">Australia&#65533;s policy on Quality Use of Medicines (QUM) aims to achieve appropriate use of medicines and improved health outcomes. Drug and Therapeutics Committees (DTCs) are educators, policy makers as well as financial gatekeepers in matters relating to medicine use. Increasingly, DTCs are also involved in risk management and clinical governance. As such, DTCs could be considered to be QUM advocates in the institutions in which they function. In a health care arena where there are escalating demands on high standards of clinical practice, quality assessment and improvement is essential in ensuring safe and effective patient care. Given the role DTCs play in safeguarding the interests of the stakeholders of the health care system, research into ways in which DTC performance could be enhanced is required.    Although indicators specific to DTCs exist, the literature does not seem to provide straightforward answers to the question of what is currently being done in terms of quality assessment and quality improvement of DTCs. In the absence of such data, an opportunity for research is clearly identified. The first aim of this research project was to gain insight into the current activities undertaken by, and challenges facing Australian DTCs. Following this, the second aim was to explore ways in which DTC performance could be augmented.    In addressing the first aim of this project, a national survey of Australian DTCs was conducted. These findings reinforce the evidence in the literature about the roles, structure and stakeholder expectations of DTCs. Our research also documents DTCs&#65533; quality improvement initiatives and barriers to DTC activities. It appears that there is little support available to Australian DTCs. Further, a case study was undertaken in order to gain an understanding of the depth and detail of DTC operations. An audit of a DTC in an Australian hospital was conducted. This study revealed that DTC decisions are being implemented in an ad hoc manner. In fact, there were no strategies (or action) planned to implement the majority of their decisions. This could have an impact on DTC performance.    In view of this finding, qualitative methods were used to explore stakeholder opinions regarding the implementation of DTC decisions and policies. Stakeholders believed that strategies used to implement DTC policies should be targeted (to the audience as well as the type of decision/policy being implemented), timely, and delivered at the point of care. Face-to-face strategies were perceived to be more effective than printed materials, particularly when an influence on clinical practice was desired. Stakeholders also felt that the lack of resources was a significant barrier to DTC performance augmentation. This probably contributed to a lack of follow-up (or review) of implemented policies. According to stakeholders, other barriers to policy implementation include a lack of ownership of policies, low DTC profile, and an over-reliance on pharmacy to implement DTC decisions. Stakeholders felt one of the ways in which DTC performance could be improved was to prioritise DTC decisions for implementation.    In pursuit of a method to prioritise DTC decisions, a survey was conducted. Stakeholders identified patient safety, cost, and the practice of evidence-based medicine as domains of important DTC decisions. The results also suggest that stakeholders recognise the need for the prioritisation of DTC decisions for implementation. Stakeholders implied that higher priority would be assigned to DTC decisions considered to be important. In a follow-up survey, stakeholders (including doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and DTC members) seemed to have agreement of the primary domains of DTC decisions. Higher levels of importance and higher priority were assigned to decisions involving the primary domains of patient safety and cost. However, level of importance and priority assignment were not consistently correlated.     The work presented in this thesis suggests that there are ways to improve DTC performance. Although conducted primarily on hospital-based DTCs, it is anticipated that the lessons learnt could be applied to state-based, or even, Area Health-based DTCs. In conclusion, this research found that there was a range of views regarding &#65533;importance&#65533; and prioritisation for implementation. Social, organisational, as well as environmental factors may contribute to this. Future research should examine other possible factors contributing to the importance and priority of DTC decisions, so that DTC policy could be appropriately implemented into practice.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug and Therapeutics Committees (DTCs);qualitative methods;Australian hospitals;quantitative methods;decision implementation;prioritisation for implementation;decision importance;quality use of medicines</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resisting the Welfare State:  An examination of the response of the Australian Catholic Church to the national health schemes of the 1940s and 1970s</field><field name="creator">Belcher, Helen Maria</field><field name="description">This thesis extends and refines a growing body of literature that has highlighted the impact of Catholic social principles on the development of welfare state provision.  It suggests that Catholic social teaching is intent on preserving the role of the traditional family, and keeping power out of the hands of the state.  Much of this literature, however, is concerned with European experience (Esping-Andersen, 1990; Castles, 1993; van Kersbergen, 1995).  More recently Smyth (2003) has augmented this research through an examination of the influence of Catholic social thought on Australian welfare policy.  He concludes that the Australian Church, at least up to the 1970s, preferred a &#65533;welfare society&#65533; over a &#65533;welfare state&#65533;, an outlook shared by the wider Australian community.    Following the lead of Smyth, this thesis extends the insights of the European research through an examination of Catholic Church resistance to ALP proposals to introduce national health schemes in the 1940s and the 1970s.  These appeared to satisfy the Church&#65533;s commitment to the poorest and most marginalised groups in the community.   Why, then, did the Australian Church resist the proposals?  The thesis concludes that there are at least two possible ways of interpreting Catholic social teaching &#65533; a preconciliar interpretation that minimises the role of the state, and a postconciliar interpretation that allows for an active, albeit limited, state.  The adoption of either is informed by socio-political factors.  The thesis, then, concludes that the response of the Church in the 1940s and the 1970s was conditioned by socio-political and historical factors that inclined the Australian Catholic Church towards a conservative view of welfare.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholic Church;health policy;religion;Catholic social teaching;Australia;welfare</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading O.J. Simpson: Everyday Rhetoric as Gift and Commodity in I Want to Tell You.</field><field name="creator">Williams, Marise</field><field name="description">The Bronco Chase and arrest of O.J. Simpson for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Goldman, and his subsequent criminal trial became one of the most captivating, mass-mediated events of the last decade of the twentieth century. Simpson's iconic celebrity status and his race as an African-American inflamed the notoriety of the crime. An insatiable spectatorial desire for Simpson and narratives concerning his alleged involvement in the Brentwood murders engulfed the American public and American culture for thirty-two months.  An excessive scrutiny of his identity by the media, law and order professionals and the populace generated a racially charged discursive cacophony. The memoir Simpson published during his remand to raise funds for his defense expenses, I Want to Tell You: My Response to Your Letters, Your Messages, Your Questions, allows for a productive critical study of everyday rhetoric and the commodity fetishism of celebrity. Released in late January 1995, during the first week of the prosecution&#65533;s opening statements in the criminal trial, I Want to Tell You was Simpson's first public comment following the nationally televised reading of his suicide note and his spectacular arrest on June 17, 1994. The intercalation of Simpson&#65533;s narrative utterance with 108 of the more than three hundred thousand letters he received from June to December 1994 as Los Angeles County Jail inmate 4013970 is a practical manifestation of the use value and exchange value of fame. The reciprocity of the epistolic, the phatic demands of address, the etiquette of fan mail and hate mail, the gift of the written text, vulnerable and resonant, reveal an adherence to the symbiotic dynamic of the celebrity-fan, writer-reader, dyadic relation and its currency. Plying his trade as idol of consumption, as spectacle, as genre, Simpson capitalised on the cultural condition of his name and his face as objects of desire. The racialised flesh of Simpson's African-American male body became a site and a sight for narrative and inscription within a pay-per-view marketplace of reification, prosopopoeia, gazeability and criminality.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">O.J.

The profiles are used for data prefetching, selection of most suitable wireless network and cache management on the mobile device in order to optimally utilize the device&#65533;s storage capacity and available bandwidth. Some of the inherent characteristics of mobile devices due to user movements are &#65533;non-persistent connection, limited bandwidth and storage capacity, changes in mobile device&#65533;s geographical location and connection (eg. connection can be from GPRS to WLAN to Bluetooth). New research is being carried out in making mobile devices work more efficiently by reducing and/or eliminating their limitations. The focus of this research is to propose, evaluate and test a new user profiling technique which specifically caters to the needs of the mobile device users who are required to access large amounts of data, possibly more than the device storage capability during the course of the day or week. This work involves the development of an intelligent user profiling system along with mobile device caching system which will first allocate weight (priority) to the different sets and subsets of the total given data based on user&#65533;s location, user&#65533;s appointment information, user&#65533;s preferences, device capabilities and available networks. Then the profile will automatically change the data weights with user movements, history of cached data access and characteristics of available networks. The Adaptive User and Device Profiles were designed to handle broad range of the issues associated with: &#65533;Changing network types and conditions &#65533;Limited storage capacity and document type support of mobile devices &#65533;Changes in user data needs due to their movements at different times of the day Many research areas have been addressed through this research but the primary focus has remained on the following four core areas.

Pseudo-modular Hopf algebras are a class of Z_2-graded ribbon Hopf algebras that generalise the concept of a modular Hopf algebra.     The quantum superalgebra Uq(osp(1|2n)) over C is considered with q a primitive Nth root of unity for all integers N &amp;gt = 3. For such a q, a certain left ideal I of U_q(osp(1|2n)) is also a two-sided Hopf ideal, and the quotient algebra U^(N)_q(osp(1|2n)) = U_q(osp(1|2n))/I is a Z_2-graded ribbon Hopf algebra.     For all n and all N &amp;gt = 3, a finite collection of finite dimensional representations of U^(N)_q(osp(1|2n)) is defined. Each such representation of U^(N)_q(osp(1|2n)) is labelled by an integral dominant weight belonging to the truncated dominant Weyl chamber. Properties of these representations are considered: the quantum superdimension of each representation is calculated, each representation is shown to be self-dual, and more importantly, the decomposition of the tensor product of an arbitrary number of such representations is obtained for even N.     It is proved that the quotient algebra U(N)^q_(osp(1|2n)), together with the set of finite dimensional representations discussed above, form a pseudo-modular Hopf algebra when N   &amp;gt = 6 is twice an odd number.     Using this pseudo-modular Hopf algebra, we construct a topological invariant of 3-manifolds. This invariant is shown to be different to the topological invariants of 3-manifolds arising from quantum so(2n+1) at roots of unity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quantum superalgebras;topological invariants;three-manifolds</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">AENEAS IN THE ANTIPODES  The teaching of Virgil in New South Wales schools from 1900 to the start of the 21st century</field><field name="creator">Matters, Emily Helene</field><field name="description">Aeneas in the Antipodes offers an Australian perspective on the teaching of Virgil&#65533;s poetry in the secondary school. The study examines practices in the State of New South Wales from 1900 to the early years of the twenty-first century.    The changing role of Latin in the curriculum is traced through a historical account showing the factors which caused a decline in the status and popularity of the subject from the beginning of the century to the 1970s. This decline, not confined to Australia, stimulated the introduction of new teaching methods with different emphases which were, to some extent, successful in preserving Latin from extinction in schools.    Against this background of change, Virgil remained the Latin author most frequently studied in the final year of school. Because this poetry was so consistently prescribed for public examinations, a detailed investigation is made of the questions set and of the examiners&#65533; comments on candidates&#65533; performance, as evidence of changes in expectations and hence, in teaching methods. The influence of trends in Virgilian scholarship is assessed by means of a review of all the officially recommended commentaries and secondary works. The growth of literary criticism from the 1960s is shown to have had a marked effect on syllabuses and examinations, and consequently on the approach taken in the classroom. The role of local professional organizations in supporting the teaching of Virgil has been documented, showing how the disappearance of official support for Latin teaching was to some extent counterbalanced by an increase in voluntary effort.    The resources and methods used to introduce Virgil to comparative beginners are classified and reviewed. An assessment is also offered of approaches made to teaching Virgil in English at both junior and senior secondary levels.    The final chapter reviews the changes brought about since 2000. Current teaching practices are documented through classroom observations and teacher surveys, substantiating the impression that while most students at the beginning of the twenty-first century are less prepared than their predecessors to translate Virgil independently, they are expected to attempt a far more sophisticated analysis of the literary features     Note: For appendix 3-10 please see hardcopy edition.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">latin teaching;Virgil reception in the 20th Century;Australian Eduction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discourse and Configurations of Gender</field><field name="creator">Larsen, Pia</field><field name="description">My research paper is an investigation of the discourse of gender in relation to the work of  Michel Foucault, Susan Bordo, Judith Butler and the artists Louise Bourgeois, Fiona  Hall, Jo Spence and Neil Emmerson. I have applied Foucault's notion of the formation,  necessity and operations of discourses as the basis from which ideas can be articulated,  and the context within which notions of gender are formulated and challenged. I examine  the processes in discourses, such as the imposition of disciplines to control the subject,  which in turn are inscribed in the body of the subject by the subject, as they begin to  perceive and define themselves in terms of the disciplines. I use this theory on the  relationship between discourse-power-knowledge to analyse my work and that of the  artists mentioned. The work of each artist is discussed in terms of the discourse of gender  and the basis from which they critique its power, its effects on bodies and forms of  representation through a marginal discourse.  For the purposes of my work, the conclusion reached is that to disrupt the discourse of  gender entails a continual questioning and awareness of its 'truths,' processes and effects.    Description of Studio Work:  The three major works examine the power and operations of the discourse of gender on  bodies and how marginal discourses subvert these constructions. My works in paper,  printmedia and metal, in two dimensions and three, reflect the effects through forms that  seek to question limitations and extend our conception of male and female bodies. The  wall piece, Out of Order, re-configures symbols and signs from the discourse of gender  as a means of disrupting notions that gender is immutable. A swirling red line is woven  through a densely layered mass of horizontal broken lines. The addition of symbols, X  and Y chromosomes, numbers and other tokens of gender, appear at various points in this  marginal discourse on conception of 'bodies.' Mammaphone, which accompanies Out of  Order and Bullrushes, consists of an enlarged breast LP playing on a turntable. The  'tracks' are a litany of terms for the breast from slang and maternal discourses. The  turntable that 'hosts' the LP sits on top of a stylised 'flight recorder's black box,' which  suggests the hidden discourse on gender. Bullrushes, is an arrangement of 20 phallic-like  forms each on a flexible metal rod that sways with the passage of air around the work.  The work presents male bodies as durable, delicate and vulnerable despite the norms of  the masculine discourse.

The attention that I have given managerial and professional men has been determined by my own political desire to problematise the continued accomplishment of hegemony. As subjects, these men and their discursive practices enable scrutiny of the regenerative labour necessary to sustain power and necessary to realise the material results that accrue to those performing such work.      My thesis examines the practices of particular groups of managerial and professional men within four discrete social settings or terrain during the post-war period. I interrogate the operations of managerial and professional men in personnel management (the terrain of work), in market research (the terrain of the market), in parenting and marriage guidance (the terrain of the family) and in the service club Rotary (the terrain of the civic). In each of these terrains I find managerial and professional men framing problems and enacting solutions. A process or intervention that makes natural the connections of interest (of advantage or disadvantage) being constantly recreated; an intervention that expresses a comfort with the mechanics and entailments of hegemony.      To enable my critical history I apply, in each terrain, a framework comprising three core elements. I historicize the accomplishment of hegemony; testing the emergence of government and positive expressions of power during post-war modernisation in the local contexts of managerial and professional men&#65533;s interventions. I people hegemony; identifying the practices of managerial and professional men as resources for doing social relations (in particular the relations of gender and class) and crucial to the operation of hegemony. And, thirdly, I demonstrate the interventions of these men to be interested; unravelling the possessive investments managerial and professional men make through their interventions.    My scrutiny of managerial and profession men and their practices, my choice of terrains in which to study them, my analysis of the process enacted in these terrain and the sources that I have utilised are not intended to assemble a biography of men&#65533;s experiences or ideal masculinities. Rather, my thesis provides a biography of interventions in order to disassemble that which appears not to be anything in particular: the ordinary regeneration of hegemony by ordinary men doing ordinary things.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian History;Men;Masculinity;Gender;Personnel Management;Market Research;Parenting;Marriage;Fatherhood;Rotary;Service clubs;modernisation;government</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International Union Activity: Politics of Scale in the Australian Labour Movement</field><field name="creator">Schmutte, Ian Michael</field><field name="description">In recent years, industrial relations scholars have begun to discuss the &#65533;revitalisation strategies&#65533; unions are using to rebuild lost density, power, and political leverage. This thesis studies the role international activities play in the revitalisation of Australian unions. Rather than assert the importance of international activity, or emphasise the value of certain forms of international activity, the thesis seeks to  understand why unions choose to engage in particular forms of international activity.  International activity in Australian unions takes on a remarkable diversity of forms. The analysis of international activity therefore requires a theory that is capable of describing these different forms of international activity and then explaining why they exist. However most scholars have not examined the role of union agency in  choosing international activity. Within industrial relations, there is very little existing  theory or research on which to base the kind of analysis proposed for the thesis.  Most theories are ideologically driven, prescriptive accounts that either promote or challenge particular institutions or ideas about international activity. The problem is that they deal with international activity as an abstract kind of response to universal pressures of globalisation. These kinds of arguments serve well to articulate  the need for unions to &#65533;think globally&#65533;, but are ill suited to the task of the thesis, which is to explain particular forms of international activity in particular unions.  The questions about international activity that the thesis intends to answer form a point of connection between industrial relations and the related discipline of labour geography. In making the connections between labour geography theory and the analysis of union international strategy, the thesis argues for labour geography as a  political economic foundation for industrial relations in the tradition of Hyman&#65533;s  Marxist theory of industrial relations. This provides a critical theoretical perspective  and conceptual vocabulary with which to criticise and extend industrial relations research on international activity. The result is a spatialised theory organised according to topics of interest in industrial relations research that can be applied to the study of Australian international activity.  The thesis is evenly divided between developing this theory and research on international activity in the Australian union movement. Empirical analysis begins with a study of the international activities and policy of the ACTU, distinguishing  different kinds of international activity. By treating the international activities of theACTU as representative of the Australian union movement as a whole, the thesis identifies three functional levels of international activity: strategy-sharing, regional solidarity, and global regulation. The chapter also examines the material and discursive construction of the international scale within the ACTU. The thesis also analyses the international activities of three Australian unions,the TWU, LHMU and CFMEU. While all three unions engage in each level of international activity, the review of their activities shows differences in the focus of each union. The thesis suggests that the explanation for these different ratios depends in part on the spatial structure of the industries that the different unions organise.  The kind of research undertaken in this thesis has little precedent. The work of the labour geographers on international activity does not deal with union revitalisation strategy, and the research from industrial relations on the strategic aspects of international activity have not latched on to labour geography. This thesis  argues that unions scale their activities internationally for particular reasons, some of  which are structural and can be specified up front, and others that are historically  contingent and can only be explored on a case-by-case basis. In examining this &#65533;politics of scale&#65533; the thesis redefines many of the issues in the discussion of international activity and proposes a new conceptual background for industrial relations generally.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">union;internationalism;labour movement;globalisation;revitalisation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellularity of Twisted Semigroup Algebras of Regular Semigroups</field><field name="creator">Wilcox, Stewart</field><field name="description">There has been much interest in algebras which have a basis consisting of diagrams, which are multiplied in some natural diagrammatic way. Examples of these so-called diagram algebras include the partition, Brauer and Temperley-Lieb algebras. These three examples all have the property that the product of two diagram basis elements is always a scalar multiple of another basis element. Motivated by this observation, we find that these algebras are examples of twisted semigroup algebras. Such algebras are an obvious extension of twisted group algebras, which arise naturally in various contexts; examples include the complex numbers and the quaternions, considered as algebras over the real numbers. The concept of a cellular algebra was introduced in a famous paper of Graham and Lehrer; an algebra is called cellular if it has a basis of a certain form, in which case the general theory of cellular algebras allows us to easily derive information about the semisimplicity of the algebra and about its representation theory, even in the non-semisimple case. Many diagram algebras (including the above three examples) are known to be cellular. The aim of this thesis is to deduce the cellularity of these examples (and others) by proving a general result about the cellularity of twisted semigroup algebras. This will extend a recent result of East. In Chapters 2 and 3 we discuss semigroup theory and twisted semigroup algebras, and realise the above three examples as twisted semigroup algebras. Chapters 4 to 7 detail and extend slightly the theory of cellular algebras. In Chapter 8 we state and prove the main theorem, which shows that certain twisted semigroup algebras are cellular.

The new SUSI tip/tilt system is based around a CCD detector and has been successfully used to both track the majority of tip/tilt power in median seeing at an R magnitude of 4.5, and to provide seeing measures for post processing. The new fringe-detection system rapidly  scans 33 to 140 $\mu$m in delay and detects the fringes using two avalanche-photodiodes. It has been used to acquire  fringe data, provide user feedback and to track the fringe group-delay position. The system visibility (fringe visibility for a point source) and throughput were found to be consistent with models of the SUSI optical beam train. Observations were made of a variety of sources, including the Mira variables R Car and RR Sco, which were observed in two orthogonal polarization states. These measurements were the first successful use of Optical Interferometric Polarimetry (OIP), and enabled scattered light to be separated from bright photospheric flux. Dust scattering was found to originate from a thin shell 2-3 continuum radii from these stars, with an optical depth of 0.1 to 0.2 at 900 nm. Physical models of Mira variables including dust formation were developed, providing consistent explanations for these results as well as many other photometric and interferometric observations.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optical interferometry;Mira variable stars;AGB stars</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Between Two Worlds: the Phenomenon of Re-emigration by Hellenes to Australia</field><field name="creator">Papadopoulos, Anthony</field><field name="description">The centrality of the thesis is the impact upon the individual Greek migrant who chose to leave his place of birth by emigrating, repatriating, and subsequently re-emigrating, and how the surreptitious nature of acculturation alters perceptions and thoughts.  The causes of such migratory translocations will be analyzed within the sociocultural and historicoeconomic conditions that appertained at the time the decisions were taken to deracinate oneself.  The study will provide an analysis of diachronic Hellenic migration and Australian immigration policies (since its inception as a federated state).  There will also be an analysis of Australia&#65533;s diachronic and dedicated immigration control mechanisms since federation, its various post-immigration integration policies of immigrants, the mass immigration program activated in the post-WWII period, and the adoption and incorporation of multiculturalism as the guiding force in migrant selection and integration.  Australia&#65533;s history, its cultural inheritance, its socioeconomic development, and its attraction as a receiving country of immigrants are analyzed, as are Australia&#65533;s xenophobia and racism at its inception, and how these twin social factors influenced its immigration program.  The study examines limitations placed upon social intercourse, employment opportunities, and other hindrances to Greek (and other non-British migrants) immigrants because of Australia&#65533;s adoption of restrictive, racially-based immigration policies.  The study focuses upon the under-development of Hellas in the first half of the twentieth century, its high unemployment and under-employment rates, and the multiple other reasons, aside form unemployment, which forced thousands of Hellenes to seek an alternative (for a better life) through internal or external migration.  Particular emphasis will be placed upon historic occasions in Greece&#65533;s history and the influence of foreign powers upon internal Greek politics.  The motivations for each distinct stage of translocation, in the lives of the respondents, will be examined within the ambit of social, cultural, economic, and historical context, which will place emphasis on the socioeconomic development of Hellas, the development of Hellenic Diaspora, Australia&#65533;s development as a receiving immigrant country, and the effects of acculturation and nostalgia upon first-generation Greek-Australians.    Given that the thesis is based upon personal recollections and detailed information that span decades of the respondents&#65533; lives, the thesis is divided into four parts for greater clarity and comprehension: the first examines respondents&#65533; lives in region of birth, their families&#65533; economic, educational, and social environment, scholastic achievements by respondents, employment status, future prospects, religiosity, hopes and aspirations, and reasons for seeking to migrate.  The second part examines respondents&#65533; lives in Australia, within the contextuality of accommodation, employment, family creation, social adaptation, language acquisition, attitude towards unionism and religion, expectations about Australia, and reasons for repatriating.    The third part analyzes repatriation and life in Greece through resettlement, accommodation, children&#65533;s schooling and adaptation, relatives&#65533; and friends&#65533; attitude, disappointments, and longing for things Australian, while it also examines re-emigratory causes and the disillusionment suffered through repatriation.  The final part assesses resettlement in Australia, and all associated social, economic, and environmental aspects, as well as respondents&#65533; children&#65533;s readaptation to different lifestyle and educational system.  The thesis concludes with recommendations for possible further studies associated with the thesis&#65533; nature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emigration;migrants;repatriation;re-emigration;acculturation;inter-generational perspectives</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Making of Domestic Violence Policy by the Australian Commonwealth Government and the Government of the State of New South Wales between 1970 and 1985: An Analytical Narrative of Feminist Policy Activism</field><field name="creator">Ramsay, Janet Kay</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of the processes by which domestic violence, as framed by Australian feminists from the early 1970s, was inserted into the policy agenda of governments, and developed into a comprehensive body of policy. The thesis covers the period between 1970 and 1985. Acknowledging the federal nature of the Australian polity, it examines these processes that unfolded within both the Australian Commonwealth government and the government of New South Wales.    The thesis provides a political history of domestic violence policy making in the identified period. It shows that policy responses to women escaping violent partners included both immediate measures (such as protection and justice strategies) and more long-term measures to attempt to secure the conditions for women&#65533;s financial, legal and personal autonomy. The elements found to have been most significant in shaping the development of such policies were the roles and identities of the participant players, including the driving role of the women suffering partner violence; the lack of contest in the early stages of policy achievement with established professionals in related fields; the uniquely &#65533;hybrid&#65533; role and positioning of refuge feminists; and the degree of integration and continuity which characterised the domestic violence policy process.    The thesis also investigates the relationship between domestic violence policy making and the broader women&#65533;s policy enterprise. It demonstrates the care with which those involved avoided the dangers of sensationalism and tokenism while striving for an appropriate policy response. The thesis pays particular attention to the circumstances in which feminists in the early 1970s experienced their &#65533;discovery&#65533; of domestic violence. It demonstrates the significance of social and economic circumstances in shaping the political options of feminists in the thesis period and those preceding it, and the extent to which policy possibilities are shaped by representations of the nature and functions of policy itself. Finally, the thesis investigates the relationship between the strategic processes undertaken and the policy outcomes produced, finding that policies achieved in the thesis period complemented and in some ways transcended accepted policy practice in the relevant period.</field><field name="date">1994</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">domestic violence;women's refuges;women's shelters;policy process;women's policy;policy activism;Australian feminism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facial affect processing in delusion-prone and deluded individuals: A continuum approach to the study of delusion formation</field><field name="creator">Green, Melissa Jayne</field><field name="description">This thesis examines attentional and cognitive biases for particular facial expressions in delusion-prone and deluded individuals.  The exploration of cognitive biases in delusion-prone individuals provides one means of elucidating psychological processes that might be involved in the genesis of delusions.    Chapter 1 provides a brief review of the continuum approach to schizophrenia, and outlines recent theoretical conceptualisations of delusions. The study of schizophrenia phenomena at the symptom level has become a popular method of inquiry, given the heterogeneous phenotypic expression of schizophrenia, and the uncertainty surrounding the existence of a core neuropathology.  Delusions are one of the most commonly experienced symptoms of schizophrenia, and have traditionally been regarded as fixed, false beliefs that are pathognomonic of an organic disease process.  However, recent phenomenological evidence of delusional ideation in the general population has led to the conceptualisation of delusions as multi-dimensional entities, lying at the extreme end of a continuum from normal through to maladaptive beliefs.       Recent investigations of the information processing abnormalities in deluded individuals are reviewed in Chapter 2.  This strand of research has revealed evidence of various biases in social cognition, particularly in relation to threat-related material, in deluded individuals.  These biases are evident in probabilistic reasoning, attribution style, and attention, but there has been relatively little investigation of cognitive aberrations in delusion-prone individuals.  In the present thesis, social-cognitive biases were examined in relation to a standard series of faces that included threat-related (anger, fear) and non-threatening (happy, sad) expressions, in both delusion-prone and clinically deluded individuals.    Chapters 3 and 4 present the results of behavioural (RT, affect recognition accuracy) and visual scanpath investigations in healthy participants assessed for level of delusion- proneness.  The results indicate that delusion-prone individuals are slower at processing angry faces, and show a general (rather than emotion-specific) impairment in facial affect recognition, compared to non-prone healthy controls.  Visual scanpath studies show that healthy individuals tend to direct more foveal fixations to the feature areas (eyes, nose, mouth) of threat-related facial expressions (anger, fear).  By contrast, delusion-prone individuals exhibit reduced foveal attention to threat-related faces, combined with &#65533;extended&#65533; scanpaths, that may be interpreted as an attentional pattern of &#65533;vigilance-avoidance&#65533; for social threat.  Chapters 5 and 6 extend the work presented in Chapters 3 and 4, by investigating the presence of similar behavioural and attentional biases in deluded schizophrenia, compared to healthy control and non-deluded schizophrenia groups.  Deluded schizophrenia subjects exhibited a similar delay in processing angry faces, compared to non-prone control participants, while both deluded and non-deluded schizophrenia groups displayed a generalised affect recognition deficit.  Visual scanpath investigations revealed a similar style of avoiding a broader range of negative (anger, fear, sad) faces in deluded schizophrenia, as well as a common pattern of fewer fixations with shorter duration, and reduced attention to facial features of all faces in both deluded and non-deluded schizophrenia.  The examination of inferential biases for emotions displayed in facial expressions is presented in Chapter 7 in a study of causal attributional style.  The results of this study provide some support for a &#65533;self-serving&#65533; bias in deluded schizophrenia, as well as evidence for an inability to appreciate situational cues when making causal judgements in both delusion-prone and deluded schizophrenia.    A theoretical integration of the current findings is presented in Chapter 8, with regard to the implications for cognitive theories of delusions, and neurobiological models of schizophrenia phenomena, more generally.  Visual attention biases for threat-related facial expressions in delusion-prone and deluded schizophrenia are consistent with proposals of neural dysconnectivity between frontal-limbic networks, while attributional biases and impaired facial expression perception may reflect dysfunction in a broader &#65533;social brain&#65533; network encompassing these and medial temporal lobe regions.  Strong evidence for attentional biases and affect recognition deficits in delusion-prone individuals implicates their role in the development of delusional beliefs, but the weaker evidence for attributional biases in delusion-prone individuals suggests that inferential biases about others&#65533; emotions may be relevant only to the maintenance of delusional beliefs (or that attributional biases for others&#65533; emotional states may reflect other, trait-linked difficulties related to mentalising ability).   In summary, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates the utility of adopting a single-symptom approach to schizophrenia within the continuum framework, and attests to the importance of further investigations of aberrant social cognition in relation to the development of delusions.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">delusions;delusion-prone;delusional ideation;schizophrenia;psychotic continuum;social cognition;face processing;facial affect;emotion perception;emotions;threat perception;eye movements;visual scanpaths;attribution style;reasoning</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Studies of an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism</field><field name="creator">Perrem, Kilian Thomas</field><field name="description">Telomeres are specialised structures, consisting of TTAGGG DNA repeats and binding  proteins, that cap the ends of human chromosomes and maintain chromosome integrity. It has  been shown that telomeres shorten with each round of cell division in most normal human somatic  cells. It has become generally accepted that this shortening is due, in part, to the inability of DNA  polymerases to replicate the extreme ends of chromosomes which is a phenomenon known as the  &#65533;end replication problem&#65533;. An intriguing hypothesis that has emerged from these observations is  that critically shortened telomeres trigger growth arrest and senescence. This is regarded as a key  determining factor in the limited lifespan of normal cells in culture and is commonly known as the  &#65533;Telomere Hypothesis of Senescence&#65533;.  In support of this hypothesis it has been demonstrated that immortalised human cells, that  have an unlimited lifespan in culture, maintain stable telomere lengths and do not undergo  progressive telomere shortening. In most cases this is due to the ribonucleoprotein enzyme  telomerase, the activation of which is as a key step in the immortalisation process. Telomerase  compensates for sequential telomere shortening by utilising an RNA template to catalyse the  addition of repeat sequences by reverse transcription. It is absent from most normal tissue but is  present in the germline and is presumably downregulated during development. Significantly,  analysis of human tumour cells has shown that a majority also have active telomerase, which  supports the importance of immortalisation in tumourigenesis.  Previous work in this laboratory has shown that, although the majority of in vitro  immortalised cells and tumour cells that have been studied maintain telomeres by reactivation of  telomerase, a proportion do not have detectable telomerase activity. These telomerase-negative  cells still maintain telomeres, however, and this is via a mechanism(s) yet to be fully elucidated  known as Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT). ALT is characterised, in addition to lack  of telomerase activity, by extreme telomere length heterogeneity with telomere lengths ranging  from over 50 kilobases (kb) of DNA to almost undetectable. This phenotype is evident, by  Southern analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH), in all ALT cells. Alternative  mechanisms of telomere maintenance, via retrotransposition and recombination, had already been  characterised in lower eukaryotes.  It has been shown in this laboratory that ALT cell lines and tumours contain a novel type  of PML body, referred to as ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs). APBs have been found in all of  the ALT cell lines so far tested and also in archival tumour sections, and contain a number of  factors which co-localise. These include PML, TTAGGG repeats, TRF 1 &amp; TRF 2 telomere  binding proteins and proteins involved in homologous recombination: RAD51 &amp; RAD52. More  recently, it has been shown that the RAD50/Mre11/Nbs1 complex, which is involved in cell cycle  checkpoint control and repair of DNA damage, is also present in APBs. The presence of these  RAD proteins in APBs is of great interest as a recombination between telomeres has been  proposed as the central mechanism by which ALT lengthens telomeres. Studies in yeast have  identified such a mechanism and it was proposed that a similar process occurred in human  immortal cells that utilise ALT. It has now been shown by this laboratory that a recombination  mechanism is indeed evident at the telomeres of ALT cells.  To date all in vitro immortalised cell lines and most tumour cell types that have been  studied have a telomere maintenance mechanism either via telomerase or ALT. Targeting  telomerase has become a major focus of anti-cancer research as inhibitors have the potential to  treat a wide variety of different tumour types. An understanding of ALT and its regulation is  likely to be important in such therapeutic strategies, as selective pressure due to telomerase  inhibition may result in ALT revertants within the tumour mass. Development of inhibitors of  both telomerase and ALT may therefore be required when targeting telomere maintenance.  The main focus of this thesis is the understanding of ALT repression in the SV40  immortalised skin fibroblast cell line GM847, as a means to further understanding the mechanism  of ALT. The data presented provide new insights into the repression of ALT and also the  relationship between telomerase and ALT which is important for our understanding of telomere  maintenance in human cancer. Hybrids formed by fusion of normal cells and ALT cells  underwent rapid telomere loss followed by senescence, indicating that normal cells contain factors  that repress ALT. This strongly suggests that ALT is recessive and is activated in part by loss or  mutation of repressors. Similar experiments were performed with ALT cells and telomerasepositive  cells, and the resulting hybrids were all telomerase-positive and ALT repressed. It is  possible that the same negative regulators are involved as additional data show that telomerase  does not act as an ALT inhibitor. Exogenous expression of telomerase in ALT cells did not  repress ALT, but both mechanisms co-existed in these transfected cells. This result provides a  further argument for targeting both ALT and telomerase in any future treatments of tumours as it  demonstrates in principle that these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive.  A serendipitous finding was that a dominant-negative telomerase catalytic subunit caused  telomere shortening in ALT cells, had not been reported elsewhere, and indeed was in contrast to  previous findings. This provided further evidence for a link between telomerase and ALT as it  suggested that there were essential components that were common to both pathways. As a further  means to understanding ALT repression, a series of experiments was performed to determine the  chromosomal localisation of ALT repressor(s) by microcell mediated chromosome transfer. This  was done to facilitate the eventual isolation of repressors. A repressor of ALT in the chemically  immortalised fibroblast cell line SUSM-1, had been reported to be localised to chromosome 7.  This result could not be repeated in the GM847 cell line, but ALT repression was evident in  GM847 cells upon transfer of chromosome 6.  Another important question regarding the nature of ALT is the structure and sequence of  the long heterogeneous telomeres generated by ALT specific recombination, which is the focus of  the final series of data that is presented. ALT telomere length heterogeneity was detected under  denaturing conditions, ruling out the possibility that it was an artefact of electrophoresis conditions  due to novel secondary structure. Although the hybridisation signal intensity of TTAGGG  increases at the onset of immortalisation in ALT cells, it had been demonstrated by restriction  digests that degenerate repeats did exist at the telomeres of some ALT cell lines. Sequences  containing telomere repeats were cloned from the ALT cell line WI38 VA13/2RA (SV40  immortalised fibroblasts) and these were found to be interspersed with a number of other  sequence fragments. The significance of these sequences in relation to the mechanism of ALT is  discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">telomeres;immortalisation;cancer;alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antitumour Metallocenes</field><field name="creator">Mokdsi, George</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a study of the chemical stability and coordination chemistry of several antitumour metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (Cp = h5-C5H5; M = Ti 1, V 2, Nb 3, Mo 4), as well as derivatives of Cp2TiCl2 1, with nucleic acids, nucleic acid constituents and proteins.   These studies were carried out in order to identify the biologically active species and more fully understand the molecular level mechanism of action of the antitumour metallocenes, in particular Cp2TiCl2 1, which is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials.   The interactions of Cp2MoCl2 4 with four oligonucleotides were studied by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy.  In 50 mM salt solutions of Cp2MoCl2 4, hydrolysis of the halide ligands occurred to give a solution with pD -2, containing a species in which both Cp rings remain metal bound for 24 h.  At pD -7, partial hydrolysis of the Cp rings (-30percent) occurred after 24 h.  Addition of an aqueous solution of Cp2MoCl2 4 in 50 mM salt to the self-complementary sequence d(CGCATATGCG)2, maintaining the pD at 6.0-7.0, showed no evidence for the formation of a metallocene-oligonucleotide complex and only peaks arising from hydrolysis of Cp2MoCl2 4 were detected.  A similar result was obtained in titration experiments with the single stranded sequence d(ATGGTA) at pD 6.5-7.0.  However, at pD 3.0, new signals assigned to a molybdocene-oligonucleotide complex(es), which was stable for hours at pD 3.0, were detected; while at pD -7 the complex is destabilised and only peaks arising from hydrolysis of Cp2MoCl2 4 were detected.  Titration experiments at low pD with Cp2MoCl2 4 and the dinucleotide dCG were consistent with formation of a complex arising due to coordination of molybdenum to guanine N7 and/or cytosine N3.  The results obtained showed that stable oligonucleotide adducts were not formed in 50 mM salt at pD -7 and hence it is highly unlikely that formation of molybdocene-DNA adducts in vivo is the primary action that is responsible for the antitumour properties of Cp2MoCl2 4.  The rate of hydrolysis of the aromatic rings of Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) and the dimethylsubstituted derivatives (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41), in aqueous solutions at pD 2-8 was studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy.  Rapid hydrolysis of both the halide/glycine and Cp ligands in Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) occurred and predominantly gave a precipitate at pD -7.  In contrast, under the same experimental conditions, the predominant species present in aqueous solutions of (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) at pH 2-8 contained both MeCp rings metal bound.  At pD &lt; 5, Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) and (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) formed similar complex(es) with purine nucleotides.  However, at pD &gt;5, stable adducts between nucleotides and Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) were not formed.  In contrast, (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) formed complex(es) with 5'-dAMP or 5'-dGMP, which were stable for 24 h.  These results suggest that formation of stable chelates between (MeCp)2TiX2 (X equals Cl 34, OCOCH2NH3Cl 41) and nucleic acid constituents in vivo is possible.  However, the methyl substituted derivatives 34 and 41 did not show any antitumour activity against EAT in mice when administered in either 10percentDMSO/90percentsaline or in water at pH 6.2-6.4, which suggests that the labile Cp-Ti bond present in Cp2TiCl2 1 is required for antitumour activity.  The synthesis of a range of Cp substituted titanocene derivatives was investigated in an attempt to prepare derivatives with modified Cp stability in comparison to the methyl substituted derivatives.  The synthesis of derivatives (CpCH2Y)2TiCl2 where Y equals ?CHO 43, ?CONMe2 44, ?NO2 45, (RCp)2TiCl2 where R equals ?COMe 46, ?COOMe 47 or ?CONMe2 48, (CpNMe2)2TiCl2 62 and (Cp(CH2)2NMe2)2TiCl2 63 was unsuccessful, due to the presence of coordinating substituents on the Cp rings and poor stability in polar, protic solvents.  Hence, these derivatives were excluded from further studies.  The rate of hydrolysis of the Cp rings of Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1, OCOCCl3 22 and OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) in aqueous solutions, 10percentDMSO/90percentD2O and 100percent DMSO was monitored by 1H NMR spectroscopy.  Rapid hydrolysis of both the carboxylate and Cp ligands of Cp2TiX2 (OCOCCl3 22 and OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) occurred in DMSO to give biologically inactive species.  The rate of these reactions were concentration dependent as dilution of these samples with saline or water to give the therapeutic conditions of 10percentDMSO/90percentD2O slowed the hydrolysis chemistry.  In contrast, samples of Cp2TiX2 (X equals Cl 1 and OCOCH2NH3Cl 27) dissolved in water, gave solutions containing the presumed antitumour active species in which the halide or glycine ligands have been hydrolysed but the Cp rings remain metal bound.  Thus, charged X ligands may be incorporated into Cp2TiX2 and will give comparable activity to Cp2TiCl2 1 provided the samples are administered in water.    The antitumour metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, V 2, Nb 3, Mo 4) and the inactive derivative (MeCp)2TiCl2 34 were found to inhibit the relaxation of supercoiled plasmid DNA pBR322 by human topoisomerase II in vitro.  These results implicated the inhibition of topoisomerase II in the mechanism of antitumour activity although there was no direct correlation between the in vitro results with biological activity against EAT in vivo.    UV spectroscopy confirmed that the metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, Mo 4) became associated with and were stabilised to hydrolysis by calf thymus DNA but not with human serum albumin.  ICP-AES was used to measure the amount of metal associated with either DNA or human serum albumin after incubation with Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, Nb 3, Mo 4) and dialysis of these solution.  The results confirmed that DNA stabilises or becomes associated with the metallocenes.  However, errors associated with the ICP-AES measurements did not allow these results to be quantified.  1H NMR spectroscopy was used to show that the antitumour metallocene Cp2MoCl2 4 formed an adduct with glutathione 72 in the pH range 3-7 through the sulfur donor group.  In comparison, the antitumour metallocenes Cp2MCl2 (M equals Ti 1, Nb 3) showed limited adduct formation with glutathione 72 at pH -3 and no adducts were detected at pH &gt; 5.5.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">antitumour;antitumor;tumour;tumor;cancer;anticancer;metallocenes;titanocene dichloride</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Search for young galactic supernova remnants</field><field name="creator">Misanovic, Zdenka</field><field name="description">A sample of 9 small-diameter radio sources has been selected from the   Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey (MGPS)   and observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in the radio   recombination line (RRL) at   5 GHz, in a search for young Galactic SNRs.    Since the RRL emission is an  unambiguous indicator of a thermal   source, this method has been used to eliminate HII regions from the  selected sample.  In addition, the IRAS and MSX   infrared data and spectral index measurements have been combined with the   RRL studies to distinguish   thermal and non-thermal sources in the selected sample.          One source (G282.8-1.2) is identified here as a possible new young Galactic  supernova remnant, based on its relatively weak infrared emission, steep  radio spectrum and  possible x-ray emission. However, the   ATCA data are  inconclusive and further studies are needed to  confirm this result.               Radio recombination line emission (H107 alpha) has been detected in   3 of the selected sources, eliminating them from  the sample of SNR candidates. In addition, the parameters of the RRL  emission from the identified HII regions have been used to estimate their  properties.           The RRL data are inconclusive for the remaining low brightness, extended sources  in the sample.  However, some of these sources are   likely to be thermal HII  regions according to the infrared and  spectral index data.        The selected method for distinguishing thermal and non-thermal Galactic  radio sources seems promising.

Autonomous systems composed of multiple sensors and multiple platforms potentially have significant importance in applications such as defence, search and rescue mining or intelligent manufacturing. However, the effective use of multiple autonomous systems requires that an understanding be developed of the mechanisms of coordination and cooperation between component systems in pursuit of a common goal. A fundamental, quantitative, understanding of coordination and cooperation between decentralised autonomous systems is the main goal of this thesis.     This thesis focuses on the problem of coordination and cooperation for teams of autonomous systems engaged in information gathering and data fusion tasks. While this is a subset of the general cooperative autonomous systems problem, it still encompasses a range of possible applications in picture compilation, navigation, searching and map building problems. The great advantage of restricting the domain of interest in this way is that an underlying mathematical model for coordination and cooperation can be based on the use of information-theoretic models of platform and sensor abilities. The information theoretic approach builds on the established principles and architecture previously developed for decentralised data fusion systems. In the decentralised control problem addressed in this thesis, each platform and sensor system is considered to be a distinct decision maker with an individual information-theoretic utility measure capturing both local objectives and the inter-dependencies among the decisions made by other members of the team. Together these information-theoretic utilities constitute the team objective.     The key contributions of this thesis lie in the quantification and study of cooperative control between sensors and platforms using information as a common utility measure. In particular,        * The problem of information gathering is formulated as an optimal control problem by identifying formal measures of information with utility or pay-off.        * An information-theoretic utility model of coupling and coordination between decentralised decision makers is elucidated.

This process  is used to map instances of combinatorial optimisation problems onto smaller,  more easily solvable instances in such a way that a solution of the former can  be readily re-constructed, without loss of information or quality, from a  solution of the latter. Self-reduction rules are surveyed for the Graph  Colouring Problem, the Maximum Clique Problem, the Steiner Problem in Graphs,  the Bin Packing Problem and the Set Covering Problem.    This thesis introduces the problem of determining the maximum sequence of  self-reductions on a given structure, and shows how the theory of  confluence can be adapted from term re-writing to solve this problem  by  identifying rule sets for which all maximal reduction sequences are equivalent.  Such confluence results are given for a number of reduction rules on problems  on discrete systems. In contrast, NP-hardness results are also presented for  some reduction rules.    A probabilistic analysis of self-reductions on graphs is performed, showing  that the expected number of self-reductions on a graph tends to zero as the  order of the graph tends to infinity.    An empirical study is performed comparing the performance of self-reduction,  graph decomposition and direct methods of solving the Graph Colouring and Set  Covering Problems. The results show that self-reduction is a potentially  valuable, but sometimes erratic, method of finding exact solutions to  combinatorial problems.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">combinatorial optmisation;self-reduction;confluence;decomposition;graph colouring;steiner problem;bin packing;set covering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiological study of risk factors associated with progression from ocular hypertension to primary open angle glaucoma</field><field name="creator">Landers, John Arthur William</field><field name="description">Background: As a multifactorial disease glaucoma may be associated with pressure-dependent and -independent factors. Ocular hypertension (OHT) may develop into primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) for many patients. We compared groups with OHT and POAG for pressure-dependent and -independent risk factors. A high prevalence of any factor(s) could indicate a contribution to progression from OHT to POAG.  Method: A sample of patients with POAG (n 438) and with OHT (n 301) were selected from those attending a tertiary referral private glaucoma practice, and data were collected regarding age and intraocular pressure at the time of diagnosis, gender, family history of glaucoma, systemic hypertension, diabetes, Raynaud's phenomenon, migraine and myopia.  Results: After multivariate analysis, older age at time of diagnosis (P&lt;0.001), myopia (odds ratio (O.R) 1.5, 95percent confidence interval (C.I)1.0-2.2; P 0.05), a family history of glaucoma (O.R 1.6, 95 percent C.I 1.1-2.3; P 0.01) and a high intraocular pressure (P 0.002) were associated with POAG. No other significant differences were found between the two groups.  Conclusion: Patients who have OHT may be at higher risk of developing POAG if they also have myopia, a family history of glaucoma or are of older age.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ocular hypertension;glaucoma;risk factors</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of avian metabolism by dietary fatty acids</field><field name="creator">Newman, Ronald Edward</field><field name="description">The role of dietary fatty acids and their subsequent effects on metabolism has received considerable attention in mammalian species. It is becoming increasingly clear that fatty acids have metabolic roles over and above their influence on energy density of the diet. Recent studies have linked changes in the fatty acyl composition of the plasma membrane, induced by the dietary fat profile, to alterations in both lipid and glucose metabolism. These dietary induced changes have profound effects on insulin action, glucose transport and enzyme activity that regulate triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis, factors that ultimately influence protein and lipid deposition of animals.   Because of their high growth rate, broiler chickens have a high requirement for energy and the use of triglycerides as a major energy source has resulted in a fat carcass. A change in the glucose-insulin balance has been suggested as being the main reason for differences in adiposity between broilers selected for fatness or leanness. The hypotheses of this thesis is based on the finding that dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA&#65533;s) increase the sensitivity of muscle tissue to insulin and this would presumably augment insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle cells. Therefore, increasing the capacity of broiler muscle tissue to utilise glucose as its principal energy substrate would reduce the bird&#65533;s reliance on triglycerides and this inturn would result in a leaner carcass.   The aims of this study are firstly to explore the role that dietary PUFA&#65533;s from the n-3 and n-6 series have on the growth and body composition of broiler chickens and secondly to determine the relationships between dietary fatty acid profile, tissue insulin sensitivity and lipid deposition. Because dietary fatty acids have been implicated in the modulation of hormones important for the growth and development of animals, a third aim of this thesis is to determine the effects of dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on pituitary and adrenal sensitivity. Since the modulation of metabolism by dietary fatty acids has been attributed to changes in the fatty acyl composition of the plasma membrane, the final aim of this study will be to investigate and characterise the molecular species of the breast muscle choline and ethanolamine phospholipids.   Feeding either fish oil a source of n-3 PUFA&#65533;s or sunflower oil a source of n-6 PUFA&#65533;s fatty acids to broiler chickens resulted in a significant (P&lt;0.01) reduction in the abdominal fat pad mass and a modest increase in breast muscle mass when compared to broilers fed edible tallow. Associated with the changes in carcass composition was an alteration in energy substrate utilisation. This was reflected by lower respiratory quotients and reduced triglyceride and insulin concentrations for the chickens fed the two PUFA diets. Coupled to the shift in energy metabolism was a significant (P&lt;0.05) increase in the proportion of PUFA&#65533;s incorporated into the abdominal fat pad and breast muscle. The dietary fat supplements resulted in the incorporation of specific fatty acid subtypes. Feeding fish oil significantly increased the proportion of long-chain n-3 PUFA&#65533;s whereas feeding sunflower oil significantly increased the proportion of long-chain n-6 PUFA&#65533;s compared to tallow feeding whose tissues were dominated by a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids.    It was further shown that dietary n-3 and n-6 PUFA&#65533;s enhanced glucose /insulin action. Feeding either fish oil or sunflower oil to broiler chickens increased insulin action when examined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The maximal insulin release in response to the glucose infusion was higher in the tallow fed group compared to either the sunflower oil or fish oil groups. To estimate the disappearance rate of glucose from the plasma and its incorporation into tissues, 2-deoxy-D-3H glucose was infused into each chicken. There were no significant differences in the clearance rate of 2-deoxy-D-3H glucose from the plasma. However, when measured under steady state conditions, the labelled glucose incorporation into the breast muscle was greater in birds fed fish oil compared to either tallow or sunflower oil feeding.    The dietary fatty acid induced increase in insulin action suggests that the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin was enhanced. This modulation of tissue sensitivity by dietary fatty acids was also shown to occur at the level of the pituitary. To provide an estimate of pituitary sensitivity, bolus GnRH and GHRH infusions were given on different days to chickens fed the three dietary treatments. Feeding sunflower oil (n-6 PUFA&#65533;s) increased the level of GH that was released in response to the GHRH infusion when compared to birds fed either tallow or fish oil (n-3 PUFA&#65533;s). This dietary fatty acid modulation appears to be specific to certain pituitary cell types as there was no effect on LH secretion following the GnRH infusion. Dietary fatty acid modulation of endocrine gland sensitivity is particular to the gland type. Although the dietary treatments mediated a distinct pattern in pituitary sensitivity to GHRH infusion, these same three diets did not influence adrenal sensitivity, as there was no difference in the corticosterone profile following either ACTH or CRF infusion.    The previously observed physiological changes for the three dietary groups was expected to be positively correlated to an alteration of the plasma membrane phospholipids induced by the dietary fatty acids. Supplementation with fish oil (n-3 PUFA&#65533;s) significantly increased levels of both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) into the choline (PC) and ethanolamine (PE) breast muscle phospholipids compared to either sunflower oil (n-6 PUFA&#65533;s) or tallow supplementation. The increase in n-3 PUFA incorporation was associated with a corresponding decrease in the proportion of arachidonic acid (AA; 20:4n-6) an event that would presumably alter substrate availability for the 1- and 2-series eicosanoids. However, feeding sunflower oil or tallow gave a molecular species profile that was remarkably similar in both fatty acid subtype and proportion. This suggests that the plasma membrane dynamics would be similar for these two dietary groups. Therefore, it is appears that factors other than a change in the fatty acyl- composition of the plasma membrane may be responsible for modifying the physiology of the broiler.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">chickens;triacylglycerols;energy metabolism;body composition;ethanclamine phospholipids;polyunsaturated fatty acids</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/799</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Best Kept Secret in the Church: The Religious Life of Women in Australian Anglicanism 1892-1995.</field><field name="creator">Ball, Gail Anne</field><field name="description">The Best Kept Secret in the Church: The Religious Life of Women in Australian Anglicanism 1892-1995.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women and the anglican church</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative Fibroblast Acylcarnitine Profiling In The Diagnostic and Prognostic Assessment of Mitochondrial Fatty Acid &#65533;-Oxidation Disorders</field><field name="creator">Sim, Keow Giak</field><field name="description">Mitochondrial fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation disorders are a group of clinically and biochemically heterogeneous defects mainly associated with intolerance to catabolic stress. The diseases are potentially fatal, but treatable and the prognosis for most diagnosed disorders is generally favourable. Early diagnosis is thus important to prevent morbidity and mortality.    This project describes an improved and validated quantitative fibroblast acylcarnitine profile assay for the investigation of suspected fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation disorders. Intact cells were incubated with deuterium-labelled hexadecanoate and L-carnitine, and the accumulated acylcarnitines in the medium analysed using electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. This modified procedure is less demanding technically, requires fewer cells and better reflects the in vivo acylcarnitine status than previously published methods.    Mitochondrial fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation is coupled to the respiratory chain. Functional defects of one pathway may lead to secondary alterations in flux through the other. The diagnostic specificity and the prognostic potential of the in vitro acylcarnitine profile assay were investigated in fibroblasts from 14 normal controls, 38 patients with  eight enzyme deficiencies of fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation presenting with various phenotypes, and 16 patients with primary respiratory chain defects including both isolated and multiple enzyme complex defects. All fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation deficient cell lines revealed disease-specific acylcarnitine profiles related to the sites of defects irrespective of the severity of symptoms or of different mutation. Preliminary studies suggested a correlation between severity of symptoms and higher concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitine species. However, the fibroblast acylcarnitine profiles from some patients with respiratory chain defects were similar to those of controls, whereas others had abnormal profiles resembling those found in fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation disorders.    In vitro acylcarnitine profiling is useful for the detection of fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation deficiencies, and perhaps the prediction of disease severity and prognostic evaluation facilitating decisions of therapeutic intervention and genetic counselling. However, abnormal profiles do not exclusively indicate these disorders, and primary defects of the respiratory chain remain a possibility. Awareness of this diagnostic pitfall will aid in the selection of subsequent confirmatory tests and therapeutic options.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inborn errors of metabolism;fatty acid &#65533;-oxidation;acylcarnitines;newborn screening;fibroblasts;tandem mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minimal music: roles and approaches of teachers engaging students with a contemporary art music through composing activities</field><field name="creator">Blom, Diana Mary</field><field name="description">Since it arose in the 1960s, the minimalist aesthetic has increasingly influenced composers of art and popular music around the world and, in turn, minimalist composers have drawn on the compositional ideas of Western popular music and several non-Western musics. Educationally, minimal music offers much potential for music in the classroom as it embodies a number of musical characteristics known to, and preferred by, students aged 9-18 years at primary, secondary and first year tertiary level.  Socially, it offers teachers an opportunity to engage students, through composing activities, with contemporary society.  The study aims, firstly, to analyse compositions by students aged 9, 12, 15 and 18 years and their teachers, seeking pastiche development of, and compositional expansion beyond, the musical concepts presented in a resource booklet of projects, The Pulse Music Album.  Secondly, this study aims to investigate how nineteen participating teachers in three countries engage their students with minimalist composing activities stimulated through the resource booklet.  The study attempts to determine why teachers adopt their particular roles and strategies by examining music qualifications, preferences and experience, teaching perspectives and teaching environments.  It also seeks to identify reasons why one group of teachers submitted pieces which were pastiches of those presented in the projects and another group submitted compositions which moved well beyond pastiche into an expansion of these same musical concepts and argues for this as evidence of dialogue with contemporary society.    Conclusions drawn from the findings note that while there are many commonalities between the backgrounds and approaches of both groups of teachers, there are clearly observed differences.  These differences suggest approaches to classroom composition for consideration by practising classroom teachers, in-service instructors and teacher training institutions.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">minimalism;minimal music;music education;composition;teaching composition</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">You're pretending, you don't need a wheelchair' - children and adolescents with spinal cord injury</field><field name="creator">Leeds, Marilyn June</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the requirements of children and adolescents with severe spinal cord injuries.

The thesis thus begins with a examination of the literature on the needs of people with disabilities and people with spinal cord injury.  Proponents of the social model of disability, which is based on the experiences of people with disabilities, contend that the main requirements of people with disabilities is ending their social marginalisation, and it is hypothesised that the requirements of the children and adolescents will be related to ending social marginalisation.     Open-ended unstructured interviews with parents, parents and adolescents and adolescents alone ( a total of 20 interviews) provided data for analysis.

Luke's narrative is set within the gendered social and cultural framework of first century Mediterranean society. Women are written into the narrative. They tell of a God who acts outside the recognised institution of Temple to announce the salvation Israel has been anticipating. Women are recipients of God's favour, widows are given a prophetic voice within the Lucan narrative. Women come to Jesus in faith. They are healed and forgiven. Women are disciples and full members of the new community of faith. They are partners with Jesus in mission and witnesses to the crucifixion, empty tomb, the angelic announcement of the resurrection and resurrection appearance. They are commissioned by Jesus as witnesses and are to receive the empowering of the Holy Spirit.    The stories of women are critical as they present a narrative that confronts the symbolic universe of Temple and temple system, purity and exclusivity, to reveal a God who becomes present with the outsider and creates community with those who come in faith to Jesus. Luke creates two competing symbolic conceptions of reality - the Temple and the household. Through the narrative he affirms the symbolic reality of household as the place of God's presence and reveals the Temple and temple system as failing to recognise Jesus as the prophet from God.    New symbols of presence create new means of belonging and new patterns of religious, social and economic life for the Lucan community. In contrast to the temple system of purity and exclusivity, Jesus, the prophet from God, now sets the boundaries of the new community - those of inclusivity, faith and forgiveness. Individuals, women and men, who recognise Jesus to be the prophetic word of God, who come in faith and are healed and forgiven, become the new community, the household of faith. The new community adopts the social and economic relationships of household, marked by relationships of reciprocity, mutuality and trust.    For first century readers, who are struggling to interpret their relationship with God following the destruction of the Jerusalem Temple, Luke's gospel narrative provides assurance and legitimation that those who have chosen the path of Christianity are the true Israel.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">women;Luke's Gospel</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Depression, Thoughts of Self-Harm and Suicidal Ideation in a Twenty One Year Clinic Cohort: Changes in Prevalence and Predictors of Disorder.</field><field name="creator">Starling, Jean</field><field name="description">Introduction. Recent studies have suggested a secular increase in the prevalence of self-harm, suicidal ideation and depression in young people. This study aims to report the changes in prevalence of psychological disturbance over time in a clinic population.    Method: Data on the prevalence of psychological symptoms was measured by the Youth Self-Report (YSR) and Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), in a 21-year clinic cohort of adolescents aged from 12 to 17. This data was analysed to investigate secular changes and predictors of disorder.    Results: Significant secular increases were demonstrated in parent reports of self-harm and suicidal ideation, of 5percent and 4percent per cohort year respectively, but there was no significant change in the anxious/depressed sub-scale. There were no changes demonstrated in self-reports of self-harm, suicidal ideation or anxiety/depression. Self-harm and suicidal ideation, both parent reported and self-reported, significantly increased with increasing age, female gender, drug use, anxiety/depression and other clinically significant scores on the YSR and CBCL sub-scales. The YSR was a more accurate predictor of both self-harm and suicidal ideation than the CBCL.    Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that there has not been a significant increase in psychological disorder in this population. There was, however, an apparent increase due to increasing parental awareness of some symptoms, particularly self-harm and suicidal ideation. While parents have a higher rate of reporting disorder, young people's self-reports remain a more accurate predictor of specific symptoms, including self-harm and suicidal ideation.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">depression;suicide;self-harm;adolescent</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuropathic orofacial pain: a review and guidelines for diagnosis and management.</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Edward Russell</field><field name="description">Neuropathic pain is defined as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". In contrast to physiological pain that warns of noxious stimuli likely to result in tissue damage, neuropathic pain serves no protective function. Examples of neuropathic pain states include postherpetic neuralgia (shingles) and phantom limb / stump pain. This pain state also exists in the orofacial region, with the possibility of several variants including atypical odontalgia and burning mouth syndrome. There is a paucity of information on the prevalence of neuropathic pain in the orofacial region. One study assessed patients following endodontic treatment and found that approximately 3 to 6percent of patients reported persistent pain. Patients predisposed to the condition atypical odontalgia (phantom tooth pain) include those suffering from recurrent cluster or migraine headaches.     Biochemical and neurobiological processes leading to a neuropathic pain state are complex and involve peripheral sensitisation, and neuronal plasticity of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Subsequent associated pathophysiology includes regional muscle spasm, sympathetic hyperfunction, and centralisation of pain. The relevant clinical features of neuropathic pain are: (i) precipitating factors such as trauma or disease (infection), (ii) pain that is frequently described as having burning, paroxysmal, and lancinating or sharp qualities, and (iii) physical examination may indicate hyperalgesia, allodynia and sympathetic hyperfunction. The typical patient complains of persistent, severe pain, yet there are no clearly identifiable clinical or radiographic abnormalities. Often, due to the chronicity of the problem, afflicted patients exhibit significant distress and are poor pain historians, thus complicating the clinician's task of obtaining a detailed and relevant clinical and psychosocial history.     An appropriate analgetic blockade test for intraoral sites of neuropathic pain is mucosal application of topical anaesthetics. Other, more specific, tests include placebo controlled lignocaine infusions for assessing neuropathic pain, and placebo controlled phentolamine infusions for sympathetically maintained pain. The treatment and management of neuropathic pain is multidisciplinary. Medication rationalisation utilises first-line antineuropathic drugs including tricyclic antidepressants, and possibly an anticonvulsant. Topical applications of capsaicin to the gingivae and oral mucosa are a simple and effective treatment. Neuropathic pain responds poorly to opioid medication. Psychological assessment is often crucial in developing strategies for pain management. Psychological variables include distress, depression, expectations of treatment, motivation to improve, and background environmental factors.      To enable a greater understanding of neuropathic pain, thereby leading to improved treatments, high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is one analytical technique that has the potential to contribute to our knowledge base. This technique allows drugs and endogenous substances to be assayed from one sample in a relatively short time. The technique can identify, confirm, and measure the concentrations of multiple analytes from a single sample.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">neuropathic pain;orofacial pain;liquid chromatography;mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Other Radicalism: an Inquiry into Contemporary Australian Extreme Right Ideology, Politics and Organisation 1975-1995.</field><field name="creator">Saleam, James</field><field name="description">This Thesis examines the ideology, politics and organization of the Australian Extreme Right 1975-1995.  Its central interpretative theme is the response of the Extreme Right to the development of the Australian State from a conservative Imperial structure into an American "anti-communist" client state, and ultimately into a liberal-internationalist machine which integrated Australia into a globalized capitalist order.  The Extreme Right after 1975 differed from the various paramilitaries of the 1930's and the conservative anti-communist auxiliary organizations of the 1945-75 period.  Post 1975, it lost its preoccupation with fighting the Left, and progressively grew as a challenger to liberal-internationalism.  The abandonment of "White Australia" and consequent non-European immigration were the formative catalysts of a more diverse and complex Extreme Right.    The Thesis uses a working definition of generic fascism as "palingenetic populist ultra-nationalism", to measure the degree of ideological and political radicalization achieved by the Extreme Right.  This family of political ideas, independent of the State and mobilized beyond the limits of the former-period auxiliary conservatives, expressed itself in an array of organizational forms.    The complexity of the Extreme Right can be demonstrated by using four typologies:  Radical Nationalism, Neo-Nazism, Populist-Monarchism and Radical-Populism, each with specific points to make about social clienteles, geographical distribution, particular ideological heritages, and varied strategies and tactics.  The Extreme Right could mobilize from different points of opportunity if political space became available.    Inevitably a mutual delegitimization process between State and Extreme Right led to public inquiries and the emplacement of agencies and legislation to restrict the new radicalism.  This was understandable since some Extreme Right groups employed violence or appeared to perform actions preparatory thereto.  It also led to show-trials and para-State crime targeted against particular groups especially in the period 1988-91.    Thereafter, Extreme Right organizations pursued strategies which led to electoral breakthroughs, both rural and urban as a style of Right-wing populist politics unfolded in the 1990's.  It was in this period that the Extreme Right encouraged the co-optation by the State of the residual Left in the anti-racist fight.  This seemed natural, as the Extreme Right's vocal references to popular democracy, national independence and the nativist heritage, had permitted it to occupy the Old Left's traditional ground.  In that way too, it was "The Other Radicalism".</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian Nationalism;neofascism;neonazism;extreme right;populism</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and prevention of pertussis in Australia</field><field name="creator">Torvaldsen, Siranda</field><field name="description">Pertussis (whooping cough) remains an important public health problem in Australia. Although mortality and morbidity from pertussis declined dramatically following the introduction of mass vaccination programs in 1953, the level of morbidity remains unacceptably high for a vaccine-preventable disease.    Aims and methods    The primary aims of this thesis were (i) to ascertain the epidemiology of pertussis in Australia between 1993 and 2000 by analysing and interpreting sources of routinely collected data on pertussis; and (ii) to examine the effectiveness of vaccination against pertussis in a number of ways. Data from three primary national sources (notifications of disease, hospitalisations for pertussis and death certificates) were used to examine the burden from pertussis in Australia over these eight years. Analyses included the age distribution of cases, temporal and geographic trends, comparisons of notification and hospitalisation data, and the impact of differences in the method of diagnosis of notified cases between years and age groups. In addition to analyses at the national level using data from the national databases, further detailed analyses were undertaken at the State level for New South Wales (NSW), the most populous Australian State.       Pertussis vaccine coverage was estimated using data from the recently established Australian Childhood Immunisation Register (ACIR); these data were also used to track the transition from whole-cell to acellular pertussis vaccines.       The different types of studies used to evaluate vaccine effectiveness were reviewed, and a method suitable for ongoing estimation of vaccine effectiveness in Australia was developed. This was then applied to the NSW data, to determine the effectiveness of pertussis vaccination in this State.    Main findings    The annual notification rate for pertussis in Australia ranged from 23&#65533;59 per 100 000 population over the eight years. Infants had the highest notification and hospitalisation rates in Australia &#65533; they accounted for 5percent of notifications, 61percent of hospitalisations and 100percent of deaths. Age-specific notification and hospitalisation rates in children aged less than two years strongly suggested a protective effect of vaccination, with the greatest reduction in rate coinciding with eligibility to receive a second dose of pertussis vaccine at four months of age. Notification rates among 5&#65533;9 year olds progressively decreased in successive age cohorts, consistent with an effect of the introduction in 1994 of a pertussis vaccine booster for preschool-aged children. Although adults (persons aged 15 years or more) accounted for half the notifications, they had the lowest notification rate.      The highest numbers of pertussis notifications were in 1997, when most jurisdictions experienced an epidemic. Notification and hospitalisation rates varied across the States and Territories and also across smaller geographic regions in NSW. Areas and years with high notification rates tended to also have high hospitalisation rates, suggesting that trends in notifications reflected trends in incidence. The number of infant hospitalisations in NSW between July 1993 and June 1999 exceeded the number of notifications by 32percent, highlighting the extent of under-notification.      Overall, and particularly amongst those aged more than 12 months, the majority of cases notified in NSW were based on the results of serological tests. The proportion diagnosed by culture of the organism was greatest in infants; the proportion diagnosed by serological tests increased with age. There was no evidence that the use of serology had increased since 1994 in NSW, hence changes in notification rates after this time are unlikely to be attributable to increased use of serological diagnosis.      ACIR records indicated that in December 2000, 92percent of one-year-old children had received three doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine and 90percent of two-year-olds had received four doses. Vaccine coverage varied by jurisdiction. Since 1997, there was an increased use of DTP vaccines containing acellular pertussis components with a corresponding decrease in the use of vaccines containing whole-cell components. In 2000, almost all DTP vaccines administered contained acellular pertussis components.      The results of the vaccine effectiveness study showed that pertussis vaccination was highly effective at preventing pertussis in NSW children, as measured by notified cases. Vaccine effectiveness was highest (91percent) in the youngest age group (8&#65533;23 months) and lowest (78percent) in the oldest age group (9&#65533;13 years). The screening method has not previously been used to estimate pertussis vaccine effectiveness in Australia.    Conclusions    This thesis demonstrates the value of integrating varied data sources in estimating the disease burden from pertussis. The data presented here show that the disease burden is substantial in all age groups, despite high levels of vaccine coverage in infants and children. This problem of disease control does not appear to be due to lack of vaccine effectiveness, but there is evidence of waning immunity over time.       The analyses presented here form a basis for the ongoing monitoring of trends in pertussis epidemiology following the replacement of whole-cell by acellular pertussis vaccines, and will assist consideration of the need for additional booster doses in adolescents and adults.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epidemiology;Pertussis;Vaccine effectiveness</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Efficient Solutions to Autonomous  Mapping and Navigation Problems</field><field name="creator">Williams, Stefan Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping algorithm as it pertains to the deployment of mobile systems in unknown environments. Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) as defined in this thesis is the process of concurrently building up a map of the environment and using this map to obtain improved estimates of the location of the vehicle. In essence, the vehicle relies on its ability to extract useful navigation information from the data returned by its sensors. The vehicle typically starts at an unknown location with no a priori knowledge of landmark locations. From relative observations of landmarks, it simultaneously computes an estimate of vehicle location and an estimate of landmark locations. While continuing in motion, the vehicle builds a complete map of landmarks and uses these to provide continuous estimates of the vehicle location. The potential for this type of navigation system for autonomous systems operating in unknown environments is enormous.       One significant obstacle on the road to the implementation and deployment of large scale SLAM algorithms is the computational effort required to maintain the correlation information between features in the map and between the features and the vehicle. Performing the update of the covariance matrix is of O(n&#65533;) for a straightforward implementation of the Kalman Filter. In the case of the SLAM algorithm, this complexity can be reduced to O(n&#65533;) given the sparse nature of typical observations. Even so, this implies that the computational effort will grow with the square of the number of features maintained in the map. For maps containing more than a few tens of features, this computational burden will quickly make the update intractable - especially if the observation rates are high. An effective map-management technique is therefore required in order to help manage this complexity.       The major contributions of this thesis arise from the formulation of a new approach to the mapping of terrain features that provides improved computational efficiency in the SLAM algorithm. Rather than incorporating every observation directly into the global map of the environment, the Constrained Local Submap Filter (CLSF) relies on creating an independent, local submap of the features in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle. This local submap is then periodically fused into the global map of the environment. This representation is shown to reduce the computational complexity of maintaining the global map estimates as well as improving the data association process by allowing the association decisions to be deferred until an improved local picture of the environment is available. This approach also lends itself well to three natural extensions to the representation that are also outlined in the thesis. These include the prospect of deploying multi-vehicle SLAM, the Constrained Relative Submap Filter and a novel feature initialisation technique. Results of this work are presented both in simulation and using real data collected during deployment of a submersible vehicle equipped with scanning sonar.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile Robot;Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping;AUV</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breeding of Hygienic Disease Resistant Bees</field><field name="creator">Lapidge, Keryn Lea</field><field name="description">Hygienic behaviour in the honeybee (Apis mellifera) has been shown to be an effective control mechanism against brood diseases such as chalkbrood and AFB.  Chalkbrood has proven to be problematic for the Australian honey industry since it was identified here in 1993.  Hygienic behaviour is a much studied trait.  Rothenbuhler investigated the genetic basis of hygienic behaviour, proposing a two-gene model to explain the uncapping and removal of dead brood.  His elegant experiment remains the textbook example of a behavioural genetic study.  Although this model has been challenged, it is still generally agreed that a small number of unlinked genes produce a large effect on hygienic behaviour, that hygienic alleles are recessive and are inherited in a Mendelian manner.     Experimental backcross colonies were produced from an inbred hygienic line and an inbred non-hygienic line, both provided by Dr. Marla Spivak, University of Minnesota.  These backcross colonies were assessed for hygienic behaviour using a standard assay.  Statistical analyses of the field data indicated that the genetic basis of the trait was more complex than either the simple Mendelian and widely accepted two-gene or three-gene models that have been proposed previously.  Molecular techniques, linkage mapping and QTL analysis then were employed to determine how many loci directly influence hygienic behaviour and the relative level of influence and location of each locus within the genome of A. mellifera.    Full multipoint linkage analysis by Mapmaker v3.0 software produced a new genetic map of the honeybee comprised of 358 marker loci ordered over 25 linkage groups spanning a total distance of 3406.2 cM.  The average distance between each marker was 9.5 cM.  QTL analysis of the experimental data identified seven putative genetic markers associated with hygienic behaviour.  QTLs located on linkage groups 2, 4, 6 and 22 were detected for both overall hygienic behaviour and uncapping behaviour only.  Individually, each QTL is of relatively small effect with each explaining only 9% &#65533; 15% of the variance in hygienic levels observed.  Collectively, the putative QTLs identified here explain 79.4% of the observed variance in the expression of hygienic behaviour.  These results indicate that there are many genes of low to moderate effect rather than few genes of large effect involved in this complex behavioural trait.  This is typical of inherited quantitative traits which do not exhibit Mendelian phenotypic ratios.    DNA extracted from the brood samples taken during testing of commercial stock, and from individual bees identified as either highly hygienic or non-hygienic in a reciprocal backcross experiment, were screened with the candidate markers associated with putative QTLs to test their diagnostic power. Unfortunately, none have produced reliably diagnostic DNA profiles.  As we have now shown that hygienic behaviour is a polygenic, quantitative trait, simple diagnostic markers for Rothenbuhler's 'uncapping' and 'removal' genes are unlikely to be achieved.  Our results show that the most likely way to improve disease resistance in Australian stock is via traditional methods of recurrent selection.     The project was responsible for the importation of new genetic material into Australia from the United States.  This hygienic stock has been well received by industry, has been widely disseminated, and incorporated into local breeding programs.  We hope that it has lead to a general improvement in the level of disease resistance in Australian commercial bees.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hygienic behaviour;honeybee;Apis mellifera</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulating and assessing salinisation in the lower Namoi Valley</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Mohammad Faruque</field><field name="description">Dryland salinity is increasing in the upper catchments of central and northern New South Wales, Australia.  Consequently, salts may be exported downstream, which could adversely affect cotton irrigated-farming systems.  In order to assess the potential threat of salinity a simple salt balance model based on progressively saline water (i.e., ECiw 0.4, 1.5, 4.0 and 9.0 dS/m) was used to simulate the potential impact of salinisation due to the farming systems. The study was carried out in the lower Namoi valley of northern New South Wales, Australia.  A comparison has been made of the various non-linear techniques (indicator kriging, multiple indicator kriging and disjunctive kriging) to determine an optimal simulation method for the risk assessment.  The simulation results indicate that potential salinisation due to application of the water currently used for irrigation (ECiw) is minimal and may not pose any problems to sustainability of irrigated agriculture.  The same results were obtained by simulation based on irrigation using slightly more saline water (ECiw 1.4 dS/m).  However, simulations based on irrigation using water of even lower quality (ECiw of 4 and 9.0 dS/m), shows potential high salinisation, which will require management inputs for sustainable cropping systems, especially legumes and wheat, which are used extensively in rotation with cotton.  Disjunctive kriging was the best simulation method, as it produced fewer misclassifications in comparison with multiple-indicator kriging and indicator kriging.  This study thus demonstrates that we can predict the salinity risk due to application of irrigation water of lower quality than that of the current water used.  In addition, the results suggest here problems of excessive deep drainage and inefficient use of water might be a problem.  The second part of this thesis deals with soil information required at the field scale for management practices particularly in areas where deep drainage is large. Unfortunately, traditional methods of soil inventory at the field level involve the design and adoption of sampling regimes and laboratory analysis that are time-consuming and costly.  Because of this more often than not only limited data are collected. In areas where soil salinity is prevalent, detailed quantitative information for determining its cause is required to prescribe management solutions.  This part deals with the description of a Mobile Electromagnetic Sensing System (MESS) and its application in an irrigated-cotton field suspected of exhibiting soil salinity. The field is within the study area of part one of this thesis-located about 2 km south west of Wee Waa.  The EM38 and EM31 (ECa) data provide information, which was used in deciding where soil sample sites could be located in the field.  The ECa data measured by the EM38 instrument was highly correlated with the effective cation exchange capacity.  This relationship can be explained by soil mineralogy.  Using different soil chemical properties (i.e. ESP and Ca/Mg ratio) a detailed transect study was undertaken to measure soil salinity adjoining the water storage.  It is concluded that the most appropriate management option to remediation of the problem would be to excavate the soil directly beneath the storage floor where leakage is suspected.  It is recommended that the dam not be enlarged from its current size owing to the unfavourable soil mineralogy (i.e. kaolin/illite) located in the area where it is located.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinisation;disjunctive kriging;misclassification;leaching fraction;electromagnetic induction</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/811</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of Solar Kilns and The Development of An Optimised Schedule for Drying Hardwood Timber</field><field name="creator">Haque, M. Nawshadul</field><field name="description">This research examines the drying of hardwood timber with particular reference to seasoning blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis) in a solar kiln. The aims of this research were to develop an optimised drying schedule for drying blackbutt and to develop and validate a mathematical model for a solar kiln.  In the first stage of this study, the cross-grain physical and mechanical properties were determined for blackbutt timber so that an optimised schedule (based on drying within a limiting strain envelope) can be developed using model predictive control techniques for drying 43 mm thick (green) blackbutt timber boards in solar kilns. This optimised schedule has been developed and tested in the laboratory. The drying time was 10% shorter for this schedule than the original schedule, compared with an expected reduction in drying time of 14% (relative to the original schedule). Overall the quality was slightly better and the drying time was shorter for the optimised schedule compared with the original schedule.  A complete solar kiln model has been developed and validated based on comparisons between the predicted and the measured internal air temperatures, relative humidities and timber moisture contents. The maximum difference between the actual and predicted moisture contents was 0.05 kg/kg. The agreement between the predicted and measured temperatures of the internal air is reasonable, and both the predictions and measurements have a similar cyclical pattern. The generally good agreement between the model prediction of the final moisture content and its measurement may be due to the careful measurement of the boundary conditions such as the solar energy input.  The key uncertainties were identified as the heat exchanger output, the measurement of the initial moisture content, the amount of accumulation of condensate on the floor, and the estimation of sky temperature. The significant uncertainty (18%) in the estimation of the initial moisture content is a key reason for the mismatch between the model prediction and the measurements. In terms of operating variables, the energy release rate from the heat exchanger had the greatest effect on the simulated performance, followed by the water spray and venting rates. The simulation suggested that a material with a lower transmissivity to thermal radiation may effectively lower radiation losses, improving the kiln performance, so such materials for glazing is a high priority.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar kilns;Timber drying;optimised schedule;wood seasoning;Eucalyptus pilularis;modelling;hardwood</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian Political Elites and Citizenship Education for 'New Australians' 1945-1960</field><field name="creator">JENKINGS, PATRICIA ANNE BERNADETTE</field><field name="description">This educational history thesis contributes to knowledge of citizenship education in Australia during the 1940s and 1950s. It provides unique perspectives on an important part of Australian citizenship educational history. This examination of citizenship education also helps to explain contemporary trends and the recent revival of citizenship education in multicultural Australia.   Following the Second World War, Australian political leaders initiated an unprecedented immigration programme to help develop and defend post-war Australia. The programme enjoyed bipartisan support and was extraordinary in terms of magnitude and nature. It became the catalyst for a citizenship education campaign orchestrated by Federal political leaders for the benefit of all Australians. The citizenship education campaign was, however, primarily aimed at non-British adult migrants. The intention of the Federal Government was to maintain the cultural hegemony of the Anglo-Celts evident in pre-war Australia. In accordance with government policy, the new arrivals were expected to assimilate into the Australian community and become loyal citizens. Citizenship rested on a common national language and thus, the focus was on teaching migrants of non-British origin English for the workplace, everyday intercourse and, as a means to dissuade migrant enclaves.   This thesis comprises of three sections which illustrate how the citizenship education campaign was extended through: (i) official education channels; (ii) the media, specifically the Australian Broadcasting Commission; and (iii) annual citizenship conventions which encompasses a case study of the Good Neighbour Movement in New South Wales. These particular areas have been chosen as they identify important and different ways the campaign was expressed and funded. Discussion of the financial arrangements concerning the implementation of the campaign is important as it uniquely illustrates the power of the Federal authorities to direct the campaign as they considered necessary. It also highlights conflict between Federal and State authorities in dealing with the education of new arrivals, primarily due to the traditional two-tier system of government extant in Australia.   The general theoretical framework of this thesis emanates from concepts and ideas of writers who illustrate, in general, the concentration of power within Australia society and supports this work's notion of a `top-down' paradigm, i.e. one invariably directed by the nation's political leaders. This paradigm is presented in an effort to provide an appreciation of the powerful nature of the Federal Government's immigration policy and citizenship education campaign in the dramatic post-war reconstruction period. The thesis is related to an elite theory of political change but with due consideration to issues of context, that is, Australian society in the 1940s and 1950s.   Understanding that there was a citizenship education campaign provides a novel means of appreciating post-war immigration policy. The campaign embedded and tied together multifarious notions extant in the Australian Government policy for the Australian community in meeting the challenges of a nation experiencing massive social and economic change. Significantly, this study helps to explain the shift from the Anglo-Celtic, mono-cultural view of citizenship to one that officially recognises the culturally diverse nature of Australian society today.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">citizenship;multiculturalism;immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/815</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling the large-scale electrical activity of the brain</field><field name="creator">Rennie, Christopher John</field><field name="description">Modeling of brain activity is often seen as requiring great computing power.

Demographic details, diagnoses, operations and complications have been entered continuously since 1982 by the author of this study.  Complications are monitored at monthly review meetings attended by medical staff.  The recurrence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) at these meetings, despite continual improvements in patient care, prompted this study.  It aims to use the database to study changes in the incidence of DVT and PE over the previous twenty years; to find what database variables predict these complications; and whether use of mechanical and pharmacological agents has had an impact on DVT and PE rate.  Univariate analysis of the incidence of DVT and PE by age, sex, length of stay (LOS), admission month, diagnosis, operation and surgeon over time was run.  Any significant variables were then analysed by multivariate logistic regression.  The DVT rate was low by world standards, but rose from 0.6% in 1979-83 to 1.2% in 1984-88, then rose exponentially to 3.60% in 1994-98 with a significantly increasing trend over the twenty years (c2 MH  =114.20, with IDF, P&lt;0.001). PE rate doubled significantly over the twenty years from 0.6% to 1.2% (c2 MH  =17.94 with 1DF, P&lt;0.001).  Age, LOS, diagnosis, operation and surgeon were significant predictors of DVT and PE.  After adjustment for LOS, time period and age, vascular surgery was found to be the strongest predictor of DVT (OR=2.82, 95% CI: 2.08-3.82, c2 =43.91, P&lt;0.01).  Vascular diagnosis was the strongest diagnosis predictor.  No effect of sex or month of admission was shown.  After adjustment for LOS, time period and age, spinal fusion was the strongest predictor of PE (OR=4.04, 95% CI: 1.81-9.03).  Anterior communicating artery aneurysm was the diagnosis most highly associated with PE.  The rise in DVT rate may be due to increased complexity of surgical and nursing management, and some screening of patients with the introduction of duplex scanning.  The doubling of PE rate is unexplained.  The risk of brain or spinal cord haemorrhage makes prophylactic anticoagulation a difficult choice. This study reveals groupings which can be used to determine appropriate prophylaxis.  Use of mechanical and pharmaceutical agents is not recorded consistently in the database, but it is known approximately when they were introduced.  No impact on the rate of DVT and PE can be demonstrated by these agents.  More vigilant and widespread use of mechanical prophylaxis might be just as effective in controlling DVT and PE.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">venous thrombosis;pulmonary embolism;neurosurgery;complications</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/818</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biodiversity: Its Measurement and Metaphysics</field><field name="creator">Roche, David</field><field name="description">Biodiversity is a concept that plays a key role in both scientific theories such as the species-area law and conservation politics. Currently, however, little agreement exists on how biodiversity should be defined, let alone measured. This has led to suggestions that biodiversity is not a metaphysically robust concept, with major implications for its usefulness in formulating scientific theories and making conservation decisions.    A general discussion of biodiversity is presented, highlighting its application both in scientific and conservation contexts, its relationship with environmental ethics, and existing approaches to its measurement. To overcome the limitations of existing biodiversity concepts, a new concept of biocomplexity is proposed. This concept equates the biodiversity of any biological system with its effective complexity. Biocomplexity is shown to be the only feasible measure of biodiversity that captures the essential features desired of a general biodiversity concept. In particular, it is a well-defined, measurable and strongly intrinsic property of any biological system. Finally, the practical application of biocomplexity is discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biodiversity;biocomplexity;complexity;metaphysics;philosophy of ecology;philosophy of biology;environmental ethics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/819</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the failure of the implementation of intellectual property laws in Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Kusumadara, Afifah</field><field name="description">For the past two decades, intellectual property law has been the fastest growing and most dynamic field in Indonesia.

Activation of P2X7 receptors induces multiple downstream effects, of which the best documented is the opening of an ionic channel that is selective for divalent cations.  Another effect of ATP is to induce the shedding of L-selectin (CD62L), a molecule which is involved in the adhesive interactions of lymphocytes on endothelial cells.  High levels of soluble L-selectin and CD23 are found in the serum of patients with B-CLL, although the mechanisms involved in their production are poorly characterized.  Because extracellular ATP causes shedding of L-selectin, we studied the effect of ATP on shedding of CD23, an adhesion molecule expressed on the surface of B-CLL lymphocytes.  ATP induced the shedding of CD23 at an initial rate of 12% of that for L-selectin, while the EC50 of ATP (35 uM) and BzATP (10 uM) was identical for shedding of both molecules.  Inactivation of the P2X7 receptor by pre-incubation with OxATP, an irreversible inhibitor of P2X7 purinoceptor, abolished ATP-induced shedding of both molecules.  Moreover, KN-62, the most potent inhibitor for the P2X7 receptor inhibited ATP-induced shedding of both CD23 and L-selectin with the same IC50 (12 nM).  Ro 31-9790, a membrane permeant zinc chelator which inhibits the phorbol-ester stimulated shedding of L-selectin  also inhibited shedding of CD23 from B-CLL lymphocytes, but the IC50 was different for the two shed molecules (25 versus 1 ug/ml respectively). Although L-selectin was completely shed by incubation of cells with phorbol-ester no CD23 was lost under these conditions. Also, Ca2+ inhibits ATP-induced CD23 shedding but not L-selectin shedding.     Since soluble CD23 and L-selectin are found in the serum of normal subjects and B-CLL patients, the expression of these two adhesion molecules on lymphocytes before and after transendothelial migration was studied in an in vitro model of this process.  In normal and B-CLL subjects, 71&#65533;b5% of L-selectin from both T and B cells and 90% of CD23 from B cells was lost following transmigration, while the expression of a range of other adhesion molecules such as VLA-4, ICAM-1, LFA-1 and CD44 was unchanged.  Lymphocytes incubated with OxATP retained  their capacity for transendothelial migration and showed the same loss of L-selectin as control leukaemic lymphocytes.  Ro 31-9790, which can protect ATP-induced both L-selectin and CD23 shedding, had no effect on inhibiting L-selectin and CD23 lost during transmigration.  These data show the presence of a second pathway for the downregulation of L-selectin and CD23 from the lymphocyte surface.    Data in vivo from 'knock-out' mice show that L-selectin is essential for the emigration of lymphocytes through high endothelial venules into lymph nodes. The migration of normal and B-CLL lymphocytes across confluent human umbilical vein endothelial monolayers was studied  in an in vitro model of this process.  Lymphocytes treated with ATP or BzATP showed 56&#65533;b25% or 67&#65533;b16% loss of L-selectin on the surface and 36&#65533;b24% or 64&#65533;b19% decrease of transmigration, respectively, while OxATP, which does not alter the L-selectin level, had no effect on lymphocyte transmigration.  Further experiments examined this correlation between L-selectin expression and lymphocyte transendothelial migration in this model system.  A quantitative assay for cell surface L-selectin showed that expression of L-selectin was lower on B-CLL lymphocytes (8,880&#65533;b5,700 molecules/cell) than on normal lymphocytes (29,500&#65533;b7,500 molecules/cell, p less than 0.001).  Also the rate of transmigration of B-CLL lymphocytes (1.5&#65533;b0.9 migrated cells/HUVEC) was lower than normal peripheral lymphocytes (2.4&#65533;b0.9 migrated cells/HUVEC, p=0.04).   Incubation of lymphocytes in complete medium for 24 hrs increased the expression of L-selectin on B-CLL lymphocytes by 1.5 to 2 fold while the normal lymphocyte L-selectin remained at the initial level.  This upregulation of B-CLL L-selectin correlated with a 2 fold increased rate of transendothelial migration.  A correlation was found between L-selectin expression on lymphocytes and their ability for  transendothelial migration (r^2=0.6).      This study shows that the adhesion molecules L-selectin and CD23 can be lost from lymphocytes by two different physiological pathways. One is by P2X7 receptor activation by extracellular ATP while the second is activated by transendothelial migration of these cells.  A second finding is that B-CLL lymphocytes have lower level of L-selectin expression and an impaired ability for transendothelial migration compared with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.  Do these results explain the high serum levels of soluble L-selectin and CD23 observed in B-CLL?  Although B-CLL lymphocytes do not recirculate as rapidly as normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, the greatly increased number of leukaemic cells in B-CLL ensures that much more soluble L-selectin and CD23 is generated during the recirculation of these cells through the body.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L-selectin;CD62L;CD23;transmigration;P2X7;B-CLL</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/821</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Structural and Metamorphic evolution of cretaceous high-P granulites, Fiordland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Daczko, Nathan Robert</field><field name="description">Fiordland is located southwest of South Island of New Zealand.

It finds that a-C:N deposited by several methods is essentially identical, with similar bonding environments for carbon and nitrogen atoms. Using evidence from several techniques, the saturation of nitrogen in an sp2 carbon matrix is discussed. The experimental studies on a range of carbon nitride solids show no evidence for a crystalline form of carbon nitride. In addition to the experimental characterisation of a-C:N, ab initio molecular dynamics were used to investigate bonding and structure in carbon nitride. These simulations show that the most common form of nitrogen bonding was three-fold sites with a lone pair of electrons. Two-fold nitrogen sites were also found in agreement with experimental findings. An increase of nitrogen in a-C:N decreases the sp3-carbon fraction, but this is not localised on the nitrogen and the effect is most severe at high densities. A simulation of a low density/high nitrogen content network shows that the nitrogen saturation seen experimentally may be due to the formation of N2 dimers and C-N molecules which are easily driven out of the structure. The ab initio simulations also explore the nature of charged nitrogen and carbon sites in a-C:N. An analysis based on Wannier Function centres provided further information about the bonding and allowed for a detailed classification of these sites. The removal of electrons from the networks caused structural changes that could explain the two-state conductivity in ta-C:N memory devices. Finally, a theoretical study of the electron energy-loss near-edge structure (ELNES) calculated using multiple scattering theory is presented. The calculated ELNES of diamond, graphite and boron, silicon and carbon nitride structures compare well to experiment and supports the experimental finding that no crystalline carbon nitride had (or has) been produced. These ELNES calculations will however, provide a means of identifying crystalline beta-C3N4 should it be synthesised.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">carbon nitride;CPMD;molecular dynamics;ELNES;wannier function;ultrahard;amorphous materials;bonding</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Training community pharmacists in cognitive behavioural intervention strategies for optimising the monitoring of non prescription combination analgesic products</field><field name="creator">De Almeida Neto, Abilio Cesar</field><field name="description">Analgesic products can produce serious side effects.  Because potent analgesics are not under medical surveillance but are available to the public without a medical prescription, any attempt to influence consumer behaviour in relation to these products must be via interventions at pharmacist level.  The Australian government is now pressuring the pharmacy profession to monitor effectively the use of such non-prescription medication.        The aim of this study was to train community pharmacists on brief intervention strategies for use in a pharmacy setting in relation to combination analgesic products.  Focus groups showed that participants had concerns about adopting confrontational counselling styles, as they feared this would antagonise consumers leading to loss of patronage without having an impact on consumer behaviour.  This concern was later reinforced by consumer interviews, which showed that a significant proportion of respondents thought that the use of non-prescription analgesics was their responsibility.  A protocol for the sales of analgesic products was designed with these issues in mind.  The transtheoretical model of change (TTM) and motivational interviewing were selected as theoretical frameworks, as they take into account differences among consumers in motivation and in intention to change behaviour and are congruent with pharmacists' concerns.  Consumer-centred intervention strategies were tailored to the individual consumer according to his/her readiness to change.  This approach was borrowed from the area of smoking secession in which it has been related to positive clinical outcomes.  The assumption was made that TTM-based intervention would also be effective in a pharmacy setting in relation to analgesic products.        In the initial pilot study, community pharmacists who simply attended a workshop in the cognitive-behavioural intervention strategies failed to incorporate the newly acquired skills to their practice and consequently lost their proficiency.  In the subsequent pilot study, when the workshop was followed by ongoing on-site training with immediate feedback and coaching through the use of pseudo-patron visits, the investigator was able to shape community pharmacists' practice behaviour in relation to the monitoring of pharmacist only analgesic products.  The methodology was then refined and in the final study trained pharmacists were significantly more likely than control pharmacists and baseline to engage in a number of behaviours related to the study intervention.  These included handling the sales of pharmacist only analgesics themselves, identifying inappropriate use, assessing readiness to change, and delivering an intervention according to the consumer's readiness to change.  The results suggested that in pharmacy practice post qualifying therapeutic skill transfer is not achieved by workshop presentation alone.  Modelling of the desired behaviour involving reinforcement and feedback is necessary.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">training;intervention;brief intervention;cognitive behavioural intervention;pharmacy;pharmaceutical care</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Kathakali: A study of the aesthetic processes of popular spectators and elitist appreciators engaging with performances in Kerala</field><field name="creator">Glynn, John Charles</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the diverse aesthetic approaches of onlookers to Kathakali, a traditional dance-drama extant in Kerala, India. Its particular contribution is based on fieldwork undertaken in the period 1991-93, especially in the districts of Trichur and Palghat, and distinguishes a continuum of two over-lapping broad groups: popular spectators and elitist appreciators who provide different, contesting voices in the interviews.    The aesthetic processes of individuals within these groups of onlookers and the ways in which they may gradually change form the primary focus of this work. Respondents to interviews provide diverse descriptions of their interactions with performances according to their perceived membership to groups of popular spectators or elitist appreciators. They also identify dimensions of performance that may contribute to the development of their own performance competence and their subsequent transition from one group of onlookers to another.    The influences that shape the diverse approaches of these groups and have been examined here include traditional Hindu aesthetics, religion, politics, caste structures and the changing shape of patronage, which is itself also a reflection of historical factors of governance.     Kathakali is first presented as vignettes of performance that reflect different locations, venues, patronage and program choices. It is then situated in relation to extant, contiguous performance genres that have contributed to its development and/or often share its billing in traditional settings.    The politics and aesthetics of the worlds of Kathakali are looked at not only in terms of their traditional, folkloric and classical development but also in contrast to more contemporary, secular and controversial dynamics that are impacting upon Kathakali today.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kathakali;Indian Performance;dance-drama;aesthetics;popular spectators;Kerala</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Lawsonia intracellularis-induced porcine proliferative enteropathies.</field><field name="creator">Collins, Alison Marie</field><field name="description">The porcine proliferative enteropathies (PPE) are a group of diseases ranging from intestinal adenomatosis (PIA), a chronic condition causing reduced growth rates in post weaning pigs, to the often fatal proliferative haemorrhagic enteropathy (PHE), resulting in intestinal haemorrhage.  PHE predominantly occurs in older and heavier pigs than the chronic disease PIA.  This thesis examined whether the age when susceptible pigs are infected affects the clinical response to L.intracellularis infection.    The characteristic pathologic lesion of PPE is the abnormal proliferation of crypt epithelial cells in the ileum and colon.  Closely associated with this proliferation is the presence of an obligately intracellular bacterium, Lawsonia intracellularis.  Characterisation of L.intracellularis was performed in in-vitro co-cultures of L.intracellularis extracted from PHE-affected mucosa.  The efficacy of antimicrobials to inhibit the growth of L.intracellularis in-vitro was evaluated and compared with isolates cultured in the United Kingdom.  The results were analysed with respect to medication strategies currently used to control PPE in piggeries.     PPE occurs in virtually all piggery management systems, including newly developed systems that are aimed at improving the herd health, such as segregated early weaning and multiple site production.  PPE is currently controlled in Australia with the routine addition of antimicrobials in pig feed, in particular olaquindox.  Recommendations to reduce the use of feed-based antibiotics in Australia require the development of alternate strategies to control diseases such as PPE.      Sequential outbreaks of PHE reported in minimal disease herds suggested that pigs could develop immunity to disease.  An experimental model of L.intracellularis infection was developed in this thesis to demonstrate that immunity to re-infection with L.intracellularis could be developed.  Infection was monitored by detection of faecal shedding of L.intracellularis and serum IgG antibodies against L.intracellularis.    Two in-feed antimicrobial strategies were analysed in this thesis for their ability to induce the development of immunity to L.intracellularis, while avoiding clinical signs of disease.  The first strategy evaluated the use of low levels of in-feed antimicrobials to allow subclinical infection and the development of immunity.  The second strategy evaluated the use of high levels of in-feed antimicrobials to terminate infection two weeks after exposure to L.intracellularis.     Gaining a greater understanding of how L.intracellularis infection is spread both within and between piggeries will enable the development of management strategies to control the spread of infection.  This thesis examined the possibility that other species in contact with pigs and piggeries such as rats, mice and birds may transmit infection to pigs.  The transmission of infection between pigs via the faecal/oral route was also examined, as was the survival and infectivity of L.intracellularis over time.      Ultimately this thesis aimed to understand the pattern of L.intracellularis infection and the survival and transmission of L.intracellularis in order to develop effective control measures for PPE, especially in minimal disease herds.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">lawsonia intracellularis;immunity;transmission of infection;survival of lawsonia intracellularis;control of the porcine proliferative enteropathies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/835</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the relationship between mood states, sense of self, flow and personal constructs in anorexia nervosa participants</field><field name="creator">Scicluna, Helen</field><field name="description">Public view removed at the authors request. 16/07/2006</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">experience sampling method;flow;anorexia nervosa;bulimia nervosa;sense of self</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/836</field></doc><doc><field name="title">HIV/STD Prevention in General Practice</field><field name="creator">Proude, Elizabeth Marjorie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines aspects of the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the Australian community, with a particular emphasis on HIV/AIDS in the context of general practice (or primary care settings).  The work has four broad aims:    i) To describe the primary prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, following from the arrival of the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Australia    ii) To describe HIV/STD risk behaviour     iii) To summarise previously known evidence of interventions to reduce risk and to raise awareness of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases     iv) To contribute new evidence addressing the potential of the general practitioners' role in HIV/STD prevention      The first chapter gives a brief review of the history of HIV/AIDS from its discovery in the United States of America to its appearance in Australia and New Zealand, and discusses the Australian response strategies, both initial and continuing, to confine the epidemic.  Specifically, the arrival of HIV/AIDS gave rise to increasing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, which hitherto, although sometimes chronic, were rarely fatal.  The public health risk of HIV necessitated swift government action and led to wider acceptance of publicity about sexual behaviour.  Although the thesis does not concentrate solely on HIV, this is still an emphasis.  This chapter provides useful background to ensuing chapters.    Chapter Two provides an overview of behavioural risk in sexually transmitted diseases.  It gives a review of risk factor prevalence studies, and introduces risk behaviour and cognitive models of behaviour change, as applied to STD risk.  Sexual behaviour is a complex social interaction, usually involving more than one person, and relying on the personality and behaviour patterns intrinsic to the individuals taking part.  It is therefore perhaps more challenging to alter than behaviour which is undertaken alone, being dependent on the behaviour and intentions of both parties. Moreover, comprehensive assessment of sexual risk behaviour requires very detailed information about each incident.  Its private nature makes accurate data difficult to obtain, and sexual risk behaviour is, correspondingly, difficult to measure.     Chapter Three reviews the effectiveness of interventions tested in primary health care settings to reduce sexual risk behaviour.  The candidate uses a replicable method to retrieve and critique studies, comparable with standards now required by the Cochrane Collaboration.  From 22 studies discussed, nine health interventions were short, 'one-shot', efforts owing to limited time, resources and other practical constraints.  This review demonstrates the scarcity of interventions with people who may be perceived as 'low-risk'. Only four interventions were carried out in community health centres and two in university health clinics. One of the university interventions showed no change in sexual behaviour in any of three arms of the intervention (Wenger, Greenberg et al 1992) while the other showed an increase in condom use in both groups, although the intervention group's self-efficacy and assertiveness also improved  (Sikkema, Winett &amp; Lombard 1995).   The rationale for the intervention, where given, is described.    Chapter Four analyses the content, format and quality of sexual health information brochures available in New South Wales at the time of the candidate's own planning for an interventional study.  One of the most effective ways to disseminate information widely is by the use of educational literature, especially when the subject material is potentially sensitive or embarrassing to discuss in person.  In this chapter, the candidate reviews the literature available at the time of designing the intervention used in Chapter Five.  Readability, attractiveness, clarity and the accurate presentation of facts about sexually transmitted disease risk are examined for each pamphlet. Forty-seven pamphlets were scored according to the Flesch formula, and twenty-four of these scored in the 'fairly' to 'very difficult' range.  There was, therefore, a paucity of easy-to-read material on these subjects.    Chapter Five evaluates a general practitioner-based counselling intervention to raise awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and to modify HIV/STD risk behaviour.  While adults aged 18-25 are less likely than older cohorts to have a regular general practitioner or to visit often, most people visit a general practitioner at least once a year.  This could provide an opportunity for the general practitioner to raise preventive health issues, especially with infrequent attendees.  As the effectiveness of an opportunistic intervention about sexual risk behaviour was yet to be tested, the candidate designed an innovative randomised controlled trial to raise awareness of risk and increase preventive behaviour.  The participation rate was 90% and 76% consented to followup; however the attrition rate meant that overall only 52% of the original participants completed the follow-up questionnaire. The intervention proved easy and acceptable both to GPs and to patients, and risk perception had increased at three months' follow-up; however this occurred in both the control (odds ratio 2.6) and the intervention group, whose risk perception at baseline was higher (odds ratio 1.3).    In order to establish some markers of risk in the general population, Chapter Six analyses data resulting from questions on sexual behaviour asked in the Central Sydney section of the NSW Health Survey.  The candidate advocated for inclusion of relevant questions to determine some benchmarks of sexual risk behaviour and to provide an indication of condom use among heterosexuals.  Although limited in scope as a result of competing priorities for questions in the survey, results demonstrate that, while a small percentage of people were at risk, those with higher levels of partner change or of alcohol use were the most likely to always use condoms.  Specifically, 100% of those with more than four new partners in the last 12 months had used condoms with every new partner.  In addition, 'heavy' alcohol users were more likely to report condom use every time with new partners (odds ratio 0.34).    To furnish data to inform future planning of educational activities for general practitioners, Chapter Seven presents the results of a survey of Central Sydney general practitioners' opinions and current practices in HIV risk reduction with in the broader context of sexually transmitted disease prevention. The general practitioner is in an ideal position to provide information and advice, especially if future research affirms the impact of such advice on STD risk behaviour.  General practitioners in this study said they would be slightly more likely to discuss sexual health matters with young patients than with older ones (p=0.091), but this was not significant.  The most cited barrier to discussing sexual health was inadequate remuneration for taking time to do so (over 50% gave this reason).  The next most cited obstacle was difficulty in raising the subject of STDs or HIV in routine consultations, but this reason was given by less than half the sample. Forty-six percent had participated in continuing medical education programs in STDs, HIV/AIDS, or hepatitis diagnosis or management; 32% of GPs had patients with HIV, and 55% of all GPs indicated they would like more training in management and continuity of care of HIV patients.  Approximately half (51%) wanted more training in sexuality issues, including sexual dysfunction.            Chapter Eight reviews the whole thesis and discusses future directions for the research agenda.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV / AIDS;sexual behaviour;sexually transmitted diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/838</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rival goals and values in administrative review: a study of migration decision making</field><field name="creator">Fleming, Gabriel Catherine</field><field name="description">Some form of administrative review of executive action is accepted in the common law world for the reason that it serves certain basic values and goals.  This study draws on political, legal and management theory in considering the values that underlie administrative review.  It is primarily concerned with the role of tribunal review.  A full range of values are considered, including fairness, justice, consistency, rationality, dignity, respect, accessibility, equity, efficiency and economy.  Some are seen as fundamental to the administrative review system while others have different purposes.      There is general agreement on many of the values and goals of administrative review.  In their practical application however, values compete, overlap and evolve in accordance with economic, social, political and legal change.  There are value tensions in, for instance, the role of independent tribunals as a check on the power of the executive while they are also within the executive, in the extent of the obligation on administrative tribunals to apply government policy and in the setting of proper limits of judicial review.  There is continuing tension in demands for individual dignity and rights to fair treatment on the one hand and notions of the 'public interest' on the other.  This thesis argues that the provision of tribunal review of administrative decisions is increasingly ideologically driven and focussed on 'functional' or 'management' values.  At times these have trumped other values in decisions about entitlements to procedural fairness, access to review, effectiveness in public administration and the achievement of the 'correct and preferable' decision in the instant case.      The focus of this thesis is a case study of migration decision-making.  The importance of this area of study is evident in the potentially devastating consequences that migration decisions can have for individuals and families.  In the context of Australia's history of inadequate and racially based migration policies, independent administrative review provides security against arbitrariness and discrimination in decision-making.  An analysis of administrative review of decisions made under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) by the Migration Review Tribunal, and its predecessor the Immigration Review Tribunal, illustrates the claim that values, in their application, have real, practical and local importance.       Issues of tribunal independence and accountability, the normative goal of review and procedural justice are considered in depth.  It is argued that where compromises are made in administrative review, underlying values should be revealed so that their practical consequences may be better understood.       The need to articulate and analyze these issues has never been greater.  The Australian administrative review system is in a period of change analogous to that of the introduction of the 'new' administrative law in the 1970s.  If tribunals are to continue to play an effective role then it is important to think clearly about how they can, in practice, embody the right mix of administrative law values.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">administrative law;migration tribunals;values</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/839</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jessie Tomlins: An Australian Army Nurse World War One.</field><field name="creator">Rae, Ruth Lillian</field><field name="description">There is an abundance of historical and anecdotal material relating to the experiences of the Australian soldier during World War 1.  These soldiers were conscious both during and after the war that their contribution was important and that it was recognised as such by Australian society at large.  Conversely there is an almost total absence of historical or anecdotal material about the role of the Australian nurse who served during this same conflict.  Whether these nurses had the same degree of consciousness, either during or after the war, that their contributions were valued or seen as important by Australian society remains, largely, unknown. This thesis attempts to redress, in part, this absence by telling the story of a nurse, Jessie Tomlins, who served in the Australian Army Nursing Service during this period.  At the same time specific aspects of the historical events surrounding World War One will be explored.     Jessie Tomlins served, first as a Staff Nurse and later as a Sister, in the 14th Australian General Hospital in Egypt during 1916. At the same time her brother, Fred Tomlins, was already serving in the 1st Australian Light Horse Regiment and spent the entire four years of World War 1 in Palestine and Egypt.  At the end of 1916 their younger brother, Will Tomlins, also joined the Army and became a member of the Anzac Mounted Division. The letters, postcards and photographs that Jessie, Fred and Will sent home to their mother and family, as well as Fred's fourteen diaries, form the foundation of this thesis.       This thesis provides a meaningful snapshot of one woman from rural Australia who completed her nurse training during the war and then served her country during one of the most brutal periods of humankind. Her own words clearly tell the story of her war time experiences whilst, at the same time, conveying her expectations, prior to, during and after, this event. The development of the Australian Army Nursing Service, as it affected Jessie, over this period is also considered.     It will be demonstrated that whilst ordinary men, soldiers, were at the military front line so too were ordinary women, nurses. The thesis will provide support for the contention that the contribution of Australian nurses in World War One, especially that of the ordinary nurse caring for the ordinary soldier, has been poorly recorded and as a result remains under-valued.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nursing;military;army nursing;AANS;World War One;Australian Nurses;ANZAC;Beersheba</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/840</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards an Alternative Description of Incomplete Sentences in Agglutinative Languages</field><field name="creator">Ido, Shinji Ido</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses 'incomplete sentences' in languages which utilise distinctively agglutinative components in their morphology.   In the grammars of the languages dealt with in this thesis, there are certain types of sentences which are variously referred to as 'elliptical sentences' (Turkish eksiltili c&#65533;mleler), 'incomplete sentences' (Uzbek to'liqsiz gaplar), 'cut-off sentences' (Turkish kesik c&#65533;mleler), etc., for which the grammarians provide elaborated semantic and syntactic analyses.  The current work attempts to present an alternative approach for the analysis of such sentences. The distribution of morphemes in incomplete sentences is examined closely, based on which a system of analysis that can handle a variety of incomplete sentences in an integrated manner is proposed from a morphological point of view. It aims to aid grammarians as well as researchers in area studies by providing a simple description of incomplete sentences in agglutinative languages.

Ultrasonic image reconstruction is particularly notorious in this  regard, with narrow transducer bandwidths and limited - sometimes sparsely  sampled apertures posing formidable difficulties for conventional signal  processing.  To overcome these difficulties, some form of regularisation is  mandatory, whereby the ill-posed problem is restated as a closely related,  well-posed problem, and then solved uniquely.    This thesis explores the application of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) regularisation  to the problem of reconstructing complex-valued imagery from sparsely sampled  coherent ultrasonic field data, with particular emphasis on three-dimensional  problems in the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of materials.  MaxEnt has not  previously been applied to this class of problem, and yet in comparison with  many other approaches to image reconstruction, it emerges as the clear leader in  terms of resolution and overall image quality.  To account for this performance,  it is argued that the default image model used with MaxEnt is particularly  meaningful in cases of ultrasonic scattering by objects embedded in homogeneous  media.    To establish physical and mathematical insights into the forward problem, linear  equations describing scattering from both penetrable and impenetrable objects  are first derived using the Born and physical optics approximations  respectively.  These equations are then expressed as a shift-invariant  computational model that explicitly incorporates sparse sampling.  To validate  this model, time-domain scattering responses are computed and compared with  analytical solutions for a simple canonical test case drawn from the field of  NDE.  The responses computed via the numerical model are shown to accurately  reproduce the analytical responses.    To solve inverse scattering problems via MaxEnt, the robust Cambridge algorithm  is generalised to the complex domain and extended to handle broadband  (multiple-frequency) data.  Two versions of the augmented algorithm are then  compared with a range of other algorithms, including several linearly  regularised algorithms and lastly, due to its acknowledged status as a competitor  with MaxEnt in radio-astronomy, the non-linear CLEAN algorithm.  These  comparisons are made through simulated 3-D imaging experiments under conditions  of both complete and sparse aperture sampling with low and high levels of  additive Gaussian noise.    As required in any investigation of inverse problems, the experimental  confirmation of algorithmic performance is emphasised, and two common imaging  geometries relevant to NDE are selected for this purpose.  In monostatic  synthetic aperture imaging experiments involving side-drilled holes in an  aluminium plate and test objects immersed in H2O, MaxEnt image reconstruction  is demonstrated to be robust against grating-lobe and side-lobe formation, in  addition to temporal bandwidth restriction.  This enables efficient  reconstruction of 2-D and 3-D images from small numbers of discrete samples in  the spatial and frequency domains.    The thesis concludes with a description of the design and testing of a novel  polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) bistatic array transducer that offers advantages  over conventional point-sampled arrays in terms of construction simplicity and  signal-to-noise ratio.  This ultra-sparse orthogonal array is the only one of  its kind yet demonstrated, and was made possible by MaxEnt signal processing.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">inverse problems;image reconstruction;ultrasonics;regularisation;array;maximum entropy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/842</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Plastic Behaviour of Cold-Formed Rectangular Hollow Sections</field><field name="creator">Wilkinson, Timothy James</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to assess the suitability of cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) for plastic design.  The project involved an extensive range of tests on cold-formed Grade C350 and Grade C450 (DuraGal) RHS beams, joints and frames.  A large number of finite element analyses was also carried out on models of RHS beams.  The conclusion is that cold- formed RHS can be used in plastic design, but stricter element slenderness (b/t) limits and consideration of the connections, are required.  Further research, particularly into the effect of axial compression on element slenderness limits, is required before changes to current design rules can be finalised.          Bending tests were performed on cold-formed RHS to examine the web and flange slenderness required to maintain the plastic moment for a large enough rotation suitable for plastic design.  The major conclusions of the beam tests were:      (i) Some sections which are classified as Compact or Class 1 by current steel design specifications do not maintain plastic rotations considered sufficient for plastic design.      (ii) The current design philosophy, in which flange and web slenderness limits are independent, is inappropriate.  An interaction formula is required, and simple formulations are proposed for RHS.            Connection tests were performed on various types of knee joints in RHS, suitable for the column - rafter connection in a portal frame.  The connection types investigated were welded stiffened and unstiffened rigid knee connections, bolted plate knee joints, and welded and bolted internal sleeve knee joints, for use in RHS portal frames.  The ability of the connections to act as plastic hinges in a portal frame was investigated.            The most important finding of the joint tests was the unexpected fracture of the cold-formed welded connections under opening moment before significant plastic rotations occurred.  The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre- line thus eliminating the need for the weld between the RHS, or the RHS and the stiffening plate, to carry the majority of the load.  The internal sleeve connections were capable of sustaining the plastic moment for large rotations considered suitable for plastic design.              Tests on pinned-base portal frames were also performed.  There were three separate tests, with two different ratios of vertical to horizontal point loads, simulating gravity and horizontal wind loads.  Two grades of steel were used for comparison.  The aims of the tests were to examine if a plastic collapse mechanism could form in a cold-formed RHS frame, and to investigate if plastic design was suitable for such frames.            In each frame, two regions of highly concentrated curvature were observed before the onset of local buckling, which indicated the formation of plastic hinges and a plastic collapse mechanism.  An advanced plastic zone structural analysis which accounted for second order effects, material non-linearity and member imperfections slightly overestimated the strength of the frames.  The analysis slightly underestimated the deflections, and hence the magnitude of the second order effects.  A second order plastic zone analysis, which did not account for the effects of structural imperfections, provided the best estimates of the strengths of the frames, but also underestimated the deflections.            While cold-formed RHS did not satisfy the material ductility requirements specified for plastic design in some current steel design standards, plastic hinges and plastic collapse mechanisms formed.  This suggests that the restriction on plastic design for cold-formed RHS based on insufficient material ductility is unnecessary, provided that the connections are suitable for plastic hinge formation, if required.              A large number of finite element analyses were performed to simulate the bending tests summarised above, and to examine various parameters not studied in the experimental investigation.  To simulate the experimental rotation capacity of the RHS beams, a sinusoidally varying longitudinal local imperfection was prescribed.  The finite element analysis determined similar trends as observed experimentally, namely that the rotation capacity depended on both the web slenderness and flange slenderness, and that for a given section aspect ratio, the relationship between web slenderness and rotation capacity was non-linear.    The main finding of the finite element study was that the size of the imperfections had an unexpectedly large influence on the rotation capacity.  Larger imperfections were required in the more slender sections to simulate the experimental results.  There should be further investigation into the effect of varying material properties on rotation capacity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">steel;cold-formed steel;hollow sections;cold-fromed steel;rectangular hollow sections;RHS;SHS;SSHS;bending;buckling;stability;instability;slenderness limits;web;flange;compactness;plastic design;connections;welding;bolting;rotation capacity;frame;analysis;plastic design;plastic analysis;elastic analysis;finite element analysis;design codes;specifications;FEA</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politeness Phenomena and Mild Conflict in Japanese Casual Conversation</field><field name="creator">Kitamura, Noriko</field><field name="description">Politeness Phenomena and Mild Conflict in Japanese Casual Conversation</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">politeness;conflict;Japanese linguistics;discourse analysis;conversation analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clinical and pharmacological studies of orofacial pain.</field><field name="creator">Vickers, Edward Russell</field><field name="description">For pain research, the orofacial region is unique in a number of ways. The region has complex local anatomy, including substantial sensory innervation from neural pathways, and muscles of facial expression that convey important information concerning pain intensity and associated psychological traits. Although chronic orofacial pain conditions appear prevalent, useful documentation on pain intensity ratings using well established instruments is sparse. In particular, two conditions, atypical facial pain and atypical odontalgia, are poorly understood in aetiology so that definitive treatment modalities are severely limited. The region's local biofluid, saliva, has been used to diagnose various local and systemic disease states, and to quantitate drug concentrations. However, recent studies indicate that saliva also contains some of the same peptides, e.g. bradykinin, that are involved in pain mechanisms.

Synopsis  The central hypotheses of this thesis are:    that global formulary apportionment is the most appropriate method for the taxation of transnational corporations (TNCs) in lieu of the present system commonly referred to as the separate accounting/arm's length method; and     that it is essential, in order to implement the proposed global formulary model, to create an international organisation which would fulfil, in the taxation field, a role equivalent to that of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in international trade.    The world economy is fast integrating and is increasingly dominated by the activities of transnational enterprises. These activities create a dual tax problem for various revenue authorities seeking to tax gains derived thereon:     Firstly, when two or more countries entertain conflicting tax claims on the same base, there arises what is commonly referred to as a double taxation problem.    Secondly, an allocation problem arises when different jurisdictions seek to determine the quantum of the gains to be allocated to each jurisdiction for taxation purposes.    The traditional regime for solving both the double taxation and the allocation problem is enshrined in a series of bilateral treaties signed between various nations. These are, in general, based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model Treaty.1 It is submitted, in this thesis, that while highly successful in an environment characterised by the coexistence of various national taxation systems, the traditional regime lacks the essential attributes suitable to the emerging 'borderless world'.  The central theme of this thesis is the allocation problem. The OECD Model attempts to deal with this issue on a bilateral basis. Currently, the allocation problem is resolved through the application of Articles 7 and 9 of the OECD Model. In both instances the solution is based on the 'separate enterprise' standard, also known as the separate entity theory.  This separate accounts/arm's length system was articulated in the 1930s when international trade consisted of flows of raw materials and other natural products as well as flows of finished manufactured goods. Such trade is highly visible and may be adequately valued both at the port of departure or at the port of entry in a country. It follows that within this particular system of international trade the application of the arm's length principle was relatively easy and proved to be extremely important in resolving both the double taxation and apportionment problems.  Today, however, the conditions under which international trade is conducted are substantially different from those that prevailed until the 1960s.  * Firstly, apart from the significant increase in the volume of traditionally traded goods, trade in services now forms the bulk of international exchanges. In addition, the advent of the information age has dramatically increased the importance of specialised information whose value is notoriously difficult to ascertain for taxation purposes.  * Secondly, the globalisation phenomenon which gathered momentum over the last two decades has enabled existing TNCs to extend their global operations and has favoured the emergence of new transnational firms. Thus, intra-firm trade conducted outside market conditions accounts for a substantial part of international trade.  * Thirdly, further economic integration has been achieved following the end of the Cold War and the acceleration of the globalisation phenomenon. In this new world economic order only TNCs have the necessary resources to take advantage of emerging opportunities.  The very essence of a TNC is 'its ability to achieve higher revenues (or lower costs) from its different subsidiaries as a whole compared to the results that would be achieved under separate management on an arm's length basis.'2 Yet, the prevailing system for the taxation of TNCs overlooks this critical characteristic and is therefore incapable of fully capturing, for taxation purposes, the aggregate gains of TNCs. The potential revenue loss arising from the inability of the present system to account for and to allocate synergy gains is substantial.  It follows that the perennial questions of international taxation can no longer be addressed within the constraints of the separate entity theory and a narrow definition of national sovereignty. Indeed, in order to mirror the developments occurring in the economic field, taxation needs to move from a national to an international level.  Moreover, a profound reform of the system is imperative in order to avoid harmful tax competition between nations and enhance compliance from TNCs. Such a new international tax system needs to satisfy the test of simplicity, equity, efficiency, and administrative ease. To achieve these objectives international cooperation is essential. The hallmark of international cooperation has been the emergence, after World War II, of a range of international organisations designed to facilitate the achievement of certain goals deemed essential by various nations. The need for an organisation to deal specifically with taxation matters is now overwhelming.   Consequently, this thesis recommends the creation of an international organisation to administer the proposed system. The main objective of this international organisation would be to initiate and coordinate the multilateral application of a formulary apportionment system which, it is suggested, would deal in a more realistic way with 'the difficult problems of determining the tax base and allocating it appropriately between jurisdictions'.3  The global formulary apportionment methodology is derived from the unitary entity theory. The unitary theory considers a TNC as a single business which, for convenience, is divided into 'purely formal, separately-incorporated subsidiaries'.4 Under the unitary theory the global income of TNCs needs to be computed, then such income is apportioned between the various component parts of the enterprise by way of a formula which reflects the economic contribution of each part to the derivation of profits.  The question that arises is whether the world of international taxation is ready for such a paradigm shift. It is arguable that this shift has already occurred albeit cautiously and in very subtle ways. Thus, the latest of the OECD Guidelines on the transfer pricing question provides that 'MNE [Multinational Enterprise] groups retain the freedom to apply methods not described in this Report to establish prices provided those prices satisfy the arm's length principle in accordance with these Guidelines.'5 Arguably, the globalisation process has created 'the specific situation' allowed for by the OECD. This thesis, therefore, explores the relative obsolescence of the bilateral approach to the taxation of TNCs and then suggests that a multilateral system is better adapted to the emerging globalised economy.   The fundamental building blocks of the model proposed in this thesis are the following:   * First, the administration and coordination of the proposed system is to be achieved by the creation of a specialised tax organisation, called Intertax, to which member countries would devolve a limited part of their fiscal sovereignty.  * Second, in order to enable the centralised calculation of TNC's profits, the proposed system requires the formulation of harmonised methods for the measurement of the global profits of TNCs. Therefore, the efforts of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) to produce international accounting standards and harmonised consolidation rules must be recognised and, if needs be, refined and ultimately implemented.   * Third, the major function of Intertax would be to determine the commercial profits of TNCs on a standardised basis and to apportion the latter to relevant countries by way of an appropriate formula/formulas.   Once this is achieved, each country would be free, starting from its share of commercial profits, to determine the taxable income in accordance with the particular tax base that it adopts and, ultimately, the tax payable within its jurisdiction. In the proposed system, therefore, a particular country would be able to independently set whatever depreciation schedules or investment tax credits it chooses, and adopt whatever tax accounting rules it deems fit relative to its policy objectives.   Moreover, this thesis argues that the global formulary apportionment model it proposes is not dramatically opposed to the arm's length principle. Indeed, it suggests that the constant assumption to the contrary, even with regard to the usual formulary apportionment methodology, is extravagant because both methodologies are based on a common endeavour, that is, to give a substantially correct reflex of a TNC's true profits.   It has often been objected that global formulary apportionment is arbitrary and ignores market conditions. This thesis addresses such concerns by rejecting the application of a single all-purpose formula. Rather, it recognises that TNCs operating in different industries require different treatment and, therefore, suggests the adoption of different formulas to satisfy specific industry requirements. For example, the formula applicable to a financial institution would be different to that applicable to the pharmaceutical industry. Each formula needs to be based on the fundamental necessity to capture the functions, taking into consideration assets used, and risks assumed within that industry. In addition, if the need arises, each formula should be able to be fine-tuned to fit specific situations. Moreover, it is also pertinent to note that the OECD already accepts 'the selected application of a formula developed by both tax administrations in cooperation with a specific taxpayer or MNE group...such as it might be used in a mutual agreement procedure, advance transfer pricing agreement, or other bilateral or multilateral determination.'6 The system proposed in this thesis can thus be easily reconciled with the separate accounting/arm's length which the OECD so vehemently advocates. Both models have the same preoccupations so that what is herein proposed may simply be characterised as an institutionalised version of the system advocated by the OECD.  Multilateral formulary apportionment addresses both the double taxation and the allocation problems in international taxation. It resolves the apportionment question 'without depending on an extraordinary degree of goodwill or compliance from taxpayers.'7 It is therefore submitted that, if applied on a multilateral basis with a minimum of central coordination, it also seriously addresses the double taxation problem. Indeed, it is a flexible method given that different formulas may be devised to suit the needs of TNCs operating in different sectors. Consequently, formulary apportionment understood in this sense, is a realistic alternative to the limitations of the present system.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">formulary taxation;unitary tax;arms length principle;world wide combined reporting</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/846</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hard Cash, John Dwyer and his Contemporaries, 1890-1914</field><field name="creator">Hearn, Mark Graeme</field><field name="description">John Dwyer (1856-1934) was a London docks foreman who emigrated to Australia in 1888. Leaving his London employment on his 'own accord', Dwyer embarked upon a quest for recognition - recognition of his rights as a worker and his identity as an individual. Dwyer and his family arrived in New South Wales to be greeted by the economic depression of the 1890s, and state and employer mobilisation against organised labour and working class radicals. Dwyer was soon reduced to scraping together a living as a boarding house manager in Sydney's poorest districts, as he helped organise the Active Service Brigade, which agitated on behalf of the unemployed.     Dwyer's surviving papers - twenty-one boxes of correspondence, manuscripts, minutes, handbills, tracts and newspaper clippings, plus several other volumes - document the life of a working class political radical and autodidact who embraced temperance, and who was fascinated by new ideas in religion and science - Darwinism, Theosophy and occult spiritualism. This thesis places Dwyer in the context of  the intense ideological ferment of new ideas in politics, theology and science that characterised the period 1890-1914. Ideas that aggressively challenged the old certainties, and which Dwyer embraced in his project to 'change the face of the world.' Changing the world contested with the need to endure its conditions. Theosophy and temperance appealed to Dwyer's notion of duty, and an instinct to rationalise the social and economic roles he seemed unable to escape. The fragmented nature of his papers, and stop-start bursts of public activism - in politics, theosophy and temperance - reflect the tension between an urge to fight, to understand, to create - struggling against the daily demands of making a living and feeding a family.    The thesis explores Dwyer's relationship with fellow radicals and workers, the labour movement and members of Sydney's social and political elite - men and women who shared and contested with his vision. Dwyer's complex and at times apparently contradictory values can be found amongst radicals and labourites alike - for example, William Lane, W.G. Spence and Bernard O'Dowd. Nor was Dywer's interest in theosophy or the occult as unusual as it might seem to modern readers.    Dwyer's papers provide important insights into dilemmas that have challenged historians: the problem of alienation, the role of the individual in the historical process, the nature of working class radicalism. Issues often analysed in theoretically abstract terms, or at a broad level of historical inquiry, across a national or class-wide scale. Broad analyses of social forces or ideologies tend to distort their historical impact and meaning, failing to capture the complex relationship of phenomena such as class or ideology with individual experience. Working from Dwyer's experience, this thesis argues that it is possible to build a complex picture of working class life in late nineteenth and early twentieth century Australia.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian History;Biography;narrative identity;John Dwyer;labour history;federation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Missing Links the role of phase synchronous gamma oscillations in normal cognition and their dysfunction in schizophrenia</field><field name="creator">Haig, Albert Roland</field><field name="description">SUMMARY    Introduction: There has recently been a great deal of interest in the role of synchronous high-frequency gamma oscillations in brain function. This interest has been motivated by an increasing body of evidence, that oscillations which are synchronous in phase across separated neuronal populations, may represent an important mechanism by which the brain binds or integrates spatially distributed processing activity which is related to the same object.    Many models of schizophrenia suggest an impairment in the integration of brain processing, such as a loosening of associations, disconnection, defective multiple constraint organization, or cognitive dysmetria. This has led to recent speculation that abnormalities of high-frequency gamma synchronization may reflect a core dimension of the disturbance underlying this disorder. However, examination of the phase synchronization of gamma oscillations in patients with schizophrenia has never been previously undertaken.    Method: In this thesis a new method of analysis of gamma synchrony was introduced, which enables the phase relationships of oscillations in a specific frequency band to be examined across multiple scalp sites as a function of time. This enabled, for the first time, the phase synchronization of gamma oscillations across widespread regions, to be studied in electrical brain activity measured at the scalp in humans. Gamma synchrony responses were studied in electroencephalographic (EEG) data acquired during a commonly employed conventional auditory oddball paradigm.    The research consisted of two sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, data from 100 normal subjects, consisting of 10 males and 10 females in each age decade from 20 to 70, was examined. These experiments were designed to characterize the gamma synchonizations that occurred in response to target and background stimuli and their functional significance in normal brain activity, and to exclude the possibility of these findings being due to electromyogram (EMG) or volume conduction artifact. The examination of functional significance involved the development of an additional new analysis technique. In the second set of experiments, data acquired from 35 patients with schizophrenia and 35 matched normal controls was analyzed. The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether patients showed disturbances of gamma synchrony compared to controls, and to establish the relationship of any such disturbances to medication levels, symptom profiles, duration of illness, and a range of psychophysiological variables.    Results: In the 100 normals, responses to target stimuli were characterized by two bursts of synchronous gamma oscillations, an early (evoked) and a late (induced) synchronization, with different topographic distributions. Only the early gamma synchronization was seen in response to background stimuli. The main variable modulating the magnitude of these gamma synchronizations from epoch to epoch was pre-stimulus EEG theta (3-7 Hz) and delta (1-3 Hz) power. Early and late gamma synchrony were also associated with N1 and P3 ERP component amplitude across epochs. Across subjects, the early gamma synchronization was associated with shorter latency of the ERP components P2, N2 and P3, smaller amplitude of N1 and P2, and smaller pre-stimulus beta power. The control analyses showed that these gamma responses were specific to a narrow frequency range (37 to 41 Hz), and were not present in adjacent frequency bands. The responses were not generated by EMG contamination or volume conduction.    In the 35 patients with schizophrenia, significant abnormalities of both the early and late synchronizations were observed compared to the 35 normal controls, with distinctive topographic characteristics. In general, early gamma synchrony was increased in patients compared to controls, and late gamma synchrony was decreased. These gamma synchrony disturbances were not related to medication level or the four summed symptom profile scores (positive, negative, general and total). They were, however, associated with duration of illness, becoming less severe the longer the patient had suffered from the disorder. The disordered gamma synchrony in patients was not secondary to abnormalities in other psychophysiological variables, but appeared to represent a primary disturbance.    Discussion: The early synchronization may relate to the binding of object representations in early sensory processing, or, given that a constant inter-stimulus interval was employed, may be anticipatory and related to active memory. The late response is probably involved in binding in relation to activation of the internal contextual model involved in late expectancy/contextual processing (context updating or context closure) for target stimuli.    The across epochs effects may relate to whether the focus of attention immediately prior to stimulus presentation is internal or is directed at the task. The across subjects effects suggest that a larger magnitude of the early gamma synchronization might indicate that the subject maintains a more stable and less ambiguous internal representation of the environment, that reduces the complexity of input and facilitates target/background discrimination and subsequent processing. The early gamma synchronization findings in patients with schizophrenia suggest that anticipatory processing involving active memory and forward-prediction of the environment is subject to over-binding or the formation of inappropriate associations. The late synchronization disturbances may reflect a fragmentation of contextual processing, and an inability to maintain contextual models of the environment intact over time.    Conclusion: This research demonstrates the potential importance of integrative network activity as indexed by gamma phase synchrony in relation to normal cognition, and the possible broad relevance of such activity in psychiatric disorders. In particular, the application in this study to patients with schizophrenia showed that an impairment of brain integrative activity (missing links) might be a key feature of this illness.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gamma;phase;synchrony;coherence;oscillations;high frequency;schizophrenia;event related potentials ERP;electroencephalogram EEG</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inverse compton scattering in high energy astrophysics</field><field name="creator">Cullen, Jason Graham</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates some aspects of the inverse Compton scattering process within      various physical contexts in high energy astrophysics. Initially an introduction to the      key results of Comptonization theory for the case of scattering in optically thick plasmas      is given, using a diffusion approach, since these results are required for the interpreta-      tion of Comptonized spectra.      Since Comptonization in astrophysical systems is frequently treated using numerical      techniques, an introduction to these is then presented. Such linear Monte Carlo photon      transport codes are typically applied to scattering in plasmas without temperature and      density gradients. Additionally, treating bulk motion can be difficult even for simple      cases.      It is demonstrated that these problems can be made tractable numerically with the use of      algorithms associated with non-linear Monte Carlo codes. Such codes can already treat      scattering within arbitrary velocity structures in a plasma, and an extension of the algo-      rithm is proposed that enables the easy calculation of photon transport in plasmas with      non-constant density as well as non-constant temperature and/or bulk motion. This      algorithm and code has been developed to treat scattering in astrophysical situations      where bulk motion, temperature gradients and density gradients are simultaneously      present in a plasma.      Both a semi-analytic approach and the numerical approach are then used to treat Comp-      tonization problems of current interest. Firstly, the standard two-phase disk-corona      model for the high-energy spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei is modified to include an      an outflow or wind which may provide an additional source of disk cooling. Earlier      slab disk-corona models predict a spectral index which is consistent with observations      only if all the accretion power is dissipated in the corona. For the models investigated      here, energy spectral indices that are consistent with observations can be obtained with      less accretion power being dissipated in the corona, as a result of an outflow/wind.      However, it is required that the wind extract large amounts of power from the disk, and      it it yet to be seen if this is a plausible scenario.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">comptonization;astrophysics;bulk motin scattering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intentions of the Framers of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution</field><field name="creator">McGrath, Frank Roland</field><field name="description">The thesis examines the speeches and debates in the Australasian Federation Conference of 1890, and the Australasian Federal Conventions of 1891 and 1897-8 for the purpose of establishing what the framers of the Commonwealth Constitution understood to be the meaning and purpose of the individual sections of the Constitution upon which they were called upon either to support or oppose.

The lived experiences of 14 older men and the horizon of this researcher developed an understanding of what it is like for men to grow old and, for some, to live with the effects of a major disability.   The study is grounded in the philosophical hermeneutics of Gadamer and framed in the context of embodiment, masculinity, and narrative. I conducted multiple in-depth interviews with older men aged from 67 to 83 years of age. Seven of the participants had experienced a stroke and I was able to explore the phenomenon of disability with them. Through thematic and narrative analyses of the textual data interpretations were developed that identified common meanings and understandings of the phenomena of ageing and disability.   These themes and narratives reveal that the men&#65533;s understandings are at odds with conventional negative views of ageing and disability. These older men are &#65533;alive and kicking&#65533;, they voice counternarratives to the dominant construction of ageing as decline and weakness, and have succeeded in remaking the lifeworld after stroke. Overall I have come to understand an overarching meaning of older men &#65533;working it out&#65533; as illustrative of a strong face of ageing and disability.  Older men seek out opportunities to participate actively in community life and, despite the challenges of ageing and disability, lead significant and meaningful lives. These findings challenge and extend our limited understandings of men&#65533;s experiences of ageing and living with disability.

The use of these models is limited, however, because they need many soil property values as input. The first step towards modelling is the collection of input data. Soil properties can be highly variable spatially and temporally, and measuring them is time-consuming and expensive. Efficient methods, which consider the uncertainty and cost of measurements, for estimating soil hydraulic properties form the main thrust of this study.    Hydraulic properties are affected by other soil physical, and chemical properties, therefore it is possible to develop empirical relations to predict them. This idea quantified is called a pedotransfer function. Such functions may be global or restricted to a country or region. The different classification of particle-size fractions used in Australia compared with other countries presents a problem for the immediate adoption of  exotic pedotransfer functions. A database of Australian soil hydraulic properties has been compiled. Pedotransfer functions for estimating water-retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity from particle size and bulk density for Australian soil are presented. Different approaches for deriving hydraulic transfer functions have been presented and compared. Published pedotransfer functions were also evaluated, generally they provide a satisfactory estimation of water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity depending on the spatial scale and accuracy of prediction. Several pedotransfer functions were developed in this study to predict water retention and hydraulic conductivity. The pedotransfer functions developed here may predict adequately in large areas but for site-specific applications local calibration is needed.   There is much uncertainty in the input data, and consequently the transfer functions can produce varied outputs. Uncertainty analysis is therefore needed. A general approach to quantifying uncertainty is to use Monte Carlo methods. By sampling repeatedly from the assumed probability distributions of the input variables and evaluating the response of the model the statistical distribution of the outputs can be estimated. A modified Latin hypercube method is presented for sampling joint multivariate probability distributions. This method is applied to quantify the uncertainties in pedotransfer functions of soil hydraulic properties. Hydraulic properties predicted using pedotransfer functions developed in this study are also used in a field soil-water model to analyze the uncertainties in the prediction of dynamic soil-water regimes.    The use of the disc permeameter in the field conventionally requires the placement of a layer of sand in order to provide good contact between the soil surface and disc supply membrane. The effect of sand on water infiltration into the soil and on the estimate of sorptivity was investigated. A numerical study and a field experiment on heavy clay were conducted. Placement of sand significantly increased the cumulative infiltration but showed small differences in the infiltration rate. Estimation of sorptivity based on the Philip's two term algebraic model using different methods was also examined. The field experiment revealed that the error in infiltration measurement was proportional to the cumulative infiltration curve. Infiltration without placement of sand was considerably smaller because of the poor contact between the disc and soil surface.   An inverse method for predicting soil hydraulic parameters from disc permeameter data has been developed. A numerical study showed that the inverse method is quite robust in identifying the hydraulic parameters. However application to field data showed that the estimated water retention curve is generally smaller than the one obtained in laboratory measurements. Nevertheless the estimated near-saturated hydraulic conductivity matched the analytical solution quite well. Th author believes that the inverse method can give a reasonable estimate of soil hydraulic parameters. Some experimental and theoretical problems were identified and discussed.   A formal analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the different methods in predicting water retention and hydraulic conductivity. The analysis identified the contribution of individual source of measurement errors to the overall uncertainty. For single measurements, the inverse disc-permeameter analysis is economically more efficient than using pedotransfer functions or measuring hydraulic properties in the laboratory. However, given the large amount of spatial variation of soil hydraulic properties it is perhaps not surprising that lots of cheap and imprecise measurements, e.g. by hand texturing, are more efficient than a few expensive precise ones.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">soil physics;inverse method;pedotransfer function;neural networks;uncertainty analysis;soil-water balance</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/853</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Benefits of health care beyond health: an exploration of non-health outcomes of health care.</field><field name="creator">Haas, Marion Ruth</field><field name="description">Recent interest in identifying and measuring health outcomes represents an advance in our understanding of how health care for individuals should be evaluated.  However, the concept of health outcomes has mainly focussed on improvements in health status. Non-health outcomes of health care may also be important to patients. In this thesis, four tasks were undertaken with the aim of identifying non-health outcomes and establishing the extent of their relevance and importance to patients. First, the illness experience literature was reviewed to identify potential non-health outcomes. Seven categories of non-health outcomes were identified: information, being treated with dignity, being able to trust the health care provider, having distress recognised and supported, participating in decision making, legitimation and reassurance. Second, to gain an in-depth understanding of these concepts, topic-specific literature was reviewed and synthesised. Third, in order to confirm how relevant and important the concepts were to patients, a qualitative study was conducted with each of two different groups of health service users. Broadly, patients considered that all the non-health concepts were relevant, although the extent to which they were important varied. Fourth, to test the relative importance of the seven concepts, a Stated Preference Discrete Choice experiment in the context of general practice was conducted. This study showed that most people thought their GP demonstrated behaviour likely to result in the production of non-health outcomes. The results showed that although all the non-health outcomes were, to some extent, preferred by respondents, trust was most important, followed by legitimation and recognition of and support for emotional distress. Once again, these results point to the importance of context in the evaluation of health care from the patient's perspective. While still being perceived as positive aspects of health care, the provision of information and acting autonomously or participating in decisions about their health care were the non-health outcomes considered least important by patients</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">health care;outcomes;qualitative;stated preference;discrete choice</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymptotic methods for tests of homogeneity for finite mixture models</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Michael  Ian</field><field name="description">We present limit theory for  tests of homogeneity for finite mixture models. More specifically,  we derive the asymptotic distribution of certain random quantities used  for testing that a mixture of two distributions is in fact  just a single distribution. Our methods apply to cases where the mixture  component  distributions come from one of a wide class of one-parameter  exponential families, both continous and discrete. We consider two  random quantities, one related to testing simple hypotheses, the other composite  hypotheses. For simple hypotheses we consider the maximum of the standardised  score process, which is itself a test statistic. For composite hypotheses  we consider the maximum of the efficient score process, which is itself  not a statistic (it depends on the unknown true distribution) but is  asymptotically equivalent to certain common test statistics in a certain sense.  We show that we can approximate both quantities with the maximum of a  certain Gaussian process depending on the sample size and the true  distribution of the observations, which when suitably normalised  has a limiting distribution  of the Gumbel extreme value type. Although the limit theory is not practically  useful for computing approximate p-values, we use Monte-Carlo simulations  to show that another method  suggested by the theory, involving using a Studentised version of  the maximum-score statistic and simulating a Gaussian process to compute  approximate p-values, is remarkably accurate and uses a fraction of the  computing resources that a straight Monte-Carlo approximation would.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mixture models;asymptotic distribution;test of homogeneity;extremes of Gaussian processes;empirical processes</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersectoral collaboration theory as a framework to assist in developing a local government food and nutrition policy</field><field name="creator">Dick, Mathew Philip</field><field name="description">The potential role of local government in NSW to address public health nutrition issues has received encouraging reports. This treatise deals with the question of whether intersectoral collaboration theory is useful to assist development of a relationship with local government to develop food and nutrition policy. Intersectoral collaboration theory describes six conditions necessary for successful action: necessity, opportunity, capacity, relationships, planned action, and sustained outcomes.    The project was a feasibility study carried out in a densely populated and multicultural local government area in Sydney&#65533;s southwest during April 1998. Eight Council employees and one elected representative were interviewed using the semi-structured questionnaire to collect a range of opinions and knowledge about Council&#65533;s involvement in a food and nutrition policy. Conceptual frameworks for the study included the Ottawa Charter and the food and nutrition system. Theoretical underpinning&#65533;s were provided by intersectoral collaboration theory and organisational change theory.     Using intersectoral collaboration theory, analysis of the interviews revealed that participants were very concerned with conditions of necessity, opportunity and capacity to develop food and nutrition policy. Intersectoral collaboration theory correctly predicted that the action proposed would have to assist Council to achieve their core business, gain social and political support and be possible within the current economic environment and level of other resources available.    Participants were not able to identify how a food and nutrition policy would meet these conditions and be feasible within the current capacity of the organisation, and therefore did not become fully engaged in the feasibility study. The health sector needs to develop arguments for local government involvement from their perspective. Organisational change within the heath sector is required to develop capacity for intersectoral partnerships, as an effective strategy to address public health nutrition issues.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government;food and nutrition policy;intersectoral collaboration;health promotion theory</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/856</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating Manufacturing Issues into Structural Optimization</field><field name="creator">Barton, Andrew Barton</field><field name="description">This dissertation aims to advance the field of structural optimization by creating and demonstrating new methodologies for the explicit inclusion of manufacturing issues. The case of composite aerospace structures was a main focus of this work as that field provides some of the greatest complexities in manufacturing yet also provides the greatest incentives to optimize structural performance.    Firstly, the possibilities for modifying existing FEA based structural optimization methods to better capture manufacturing constraints are investigated. Examples of brick-based topology optimization, shell-based topology optimization, parametric sizing optimization and manufacturing process optimization are given. From these examples, a number of fundamental limitations to these methods were observed and are discussed. The key limitation that was uncovered related to a dichotomy between analytical methods (such as FEA) and CAD-type methods.    Based on these observations, a new Knowledge-Based framework for structural optimization was suggested whereby manufacturing issues are integrally linked to the more conventional structural issues. A prototype system to implement this new framework was developed and is discussed. Finally, the validity of the framework was demonstrated by application to a generic composite rib design problem.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">structural optimization;composite;FEA;CAE;CAD;feature-based;knowledge-based;topology;sizing;manufacturing;aerospace</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/857</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investment Manager Characteristics, Strategy and Fund Performance.</field><field name="creator">Gallagher, David R</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents five research essays evaluating the performance of   managed funds in light of the investment strategy and manager characteristics   exhibited by institutional investment companies. An analysis of investment   performance with respect to a fund managers strategy provides important   information in determining whether performance objectives have been   achieved. There are a number of different types of investment strategies   managed funds may adopt. However, the primary dichotomy is on the basis of   whether the portfolio manager implements either an active or index approach.   Active managers attempt to outperform the market through the use of   price-sensitive information, whereas a passive manager's objective is to   replicate the returns and risk of a target benchmark index. The evaluation   of investment manager characteristics is also evaluated. This is motivated   on the basis that asset management entities place significant emphasis on   both the articulation and differentiation of their investment style relative   to competitors, and selling the strengths of their portfolio management   skills (in terms of past performance) as well identifying the key individuals   comprising their investment team and their unique attributes.   For active equity managers, the methods used in constructing portfolios and   implementing the investment strategy include security selection, in terms of   'top-down' or 'bottom-up' strategies, value-biased, growth-biased or   style-neutral strategies, and portfolios exhibiting market capitalisation   biases (i.e. preferences to large or small-cap securities). In terms of   active bond portfolio management, the most common strategies include duration   management and yield curve positioning. Active managers' strategies are   likely to extend beyond stock selection, in particular, where the fund   manager adjusts the portfolio's composition in anticipation of favourably   capitalising on future movements in the market. For index managers,   replication of both the returns and risk of the underlying index may be   achieved through either full-replication of constituent stocks comprising the   index, or through non-replication techniques (stratified sampling and/or   optimisation). Each essay provides a unique contribution to the literature   with respect to the performance of active and index funds, as well as an   analysis of funds that invest specifically in domestic equities, domestic   fixed interest, and diversified funds that invest across the broad spectrum   of asset classes.   The origins of the performance evaluation literature are ascribed to Cowles'   (1933) pioneering work, and the literature has given increasing attention to   the topic. However the most fundamental issue considered in almost all   previous studies of managed fund performance is the extent to which actively   managed portfolios have earned superior risk-adjusted excess returns for   investors. The literature has overwhelmingly documented (with a small number   of exceptions) that active funds have been unable to earn superior returns,   either before or after expenses (e.g. Jensen (1968), Elton et al. (1993),   Malkiel (1995), Gruber (1996)). While the international evidence is   supported by the few Australian managed fund studies available, Australian   research remains surprisingly scarce. This is perplexing considering the   sheer size of the investment industry in Australia (around $A717 billion as   at 30 June 2001) and the importance placed on the sector with respect to   successive Federal Governments' retirement income policies. The objectives   of this dissertation therefore involve an analysis of managed fund   performance with respect to differences in investment strategies (i.e. active   and index), as well as providing an analysis of funds invested in equities,   bonds and diversified asset classes (or multi-sector portfolios).   The first essay evaluates the market timing and security selection   capabilities of Australian pooled superannuation funds. These funds provide   institutional investors with exposure to securities across many different   asset classes, including domestic and international equities, domestic and   international fixed interest, property and cash. Surprisingly, the specific   analysis of multi-sector funds is scarce in the literature and limited to   Brinson et al. (1986, 1991), Sinclair (1990), and Blake et al. (1999). This   essay also evaluates performance for the three largest asset classes within   diversified superannuation funds and their contribution to overall portfolio   return. The importance of an accurately specified market portfolio proxy in   the measurement of investment performance is demonstrated, where the essay   employs performance benchmarks that account for the multi-sector investment   decisions of active investment managers in a manner that is consistent with   their unique investment strategy. This approach rectifies Sinclair's (1990)   analysis resulting from benchmark misspecification. Consistent with the   literature, the empirical results indicate that Australian pooled   superannuation funds do not exhibit significantly positive security selection   or market timing skill.   Given the evidence in the literature surrounding the inability of active   funds to deliver superior returns to investors, lower cost index funds have   become increasingly popular as an alternative investment strategy. Despite   the significant growth in index funds since 1976, when the first index mutual   fund was launched in the U.S., research on their performance is sparse in the   U.S. and non-existent in Australia. The second essay provides an original   analysis of the Australian index fund market, with specific analysis   applicable to institutional Australian equity index funds offered by fund   managers. While indexing is theoretically straightforward, in practice there   exist potential difficulties in exactly matching the return of the underlying   index. Therefore the magnitude of tracking error is likely to be of concern   to investors. This essay documents the existence of significant tracking   error for Australian index funds, where the magnitude of the difference   between index fund returns and index returns averages between 7.4 and 22.3   basis points per month for funds operating at least five years. However,   there is little evidence of bias in tracking error, implying that these funds   neither systematically outperform or underperform their benchmark on a before   cost basis. Further analysis documents that the magnitude of tracking error   is related to fund cash flows, market volatility, transaction costs and index   replication strategies used by passive investment managers.   The third essay presents evidence of the performance of U.S. mutual funds,   where attention is given to both active and index mutual funds for which the   applicable benchmark index is the S&amp;P 500. This essay examines both the   magnitude and variation of tracking error over time for S&amp;P 500 index mutual   funds. The essay documents seasonality in S&amp;P 500 index mutual fund tracking   error, where tracking error is significantly higher in the months of January   and May, together with a seasonal trough in the quarters ending   March-June-September-December. Statistical evidence indicates tracking error   is both positively and significantly correlated with the dividend payments   arising from constituent S&amp;P 500 securities. In terms of a performance   comparison between actively managed and index funds, active funds on average   are found to significantly underperform passive benchmarks. On the other   hand, S&amp;P 500 index mutual funds earned higher risk-adjusted excess returns   after expenses than large capitalisation-oriented active mutual funds in the   period examined. These results suggest the S&amp;P 500 is consistent with   capital market efficiency, implying an absence of economic benefit accruing   to the average investor utilising actively managed U.S. equity mutual funds.   The fourth essay presented in the dissertation examines the performance of   Australian investment management organisations with direct reference to their   specific characteristics and strategies employed. Using a unique information   source, performance is evaluated for actively managed institutional balanced   funds (or diversified asset class funds), Australian share funds and   Australian bond funds. Performance is evaluated with respect to the   investment strategy adopted, the experience and qualifications held by   investment professionals, and the tenure of the key investment   professionals. This essay also evaluates the performance of senior sector   heads to determine the skills of individuals driving the investment process,   even though these individuals may migrate to competitor organisations. The   essay finds evidence that a significant number of active Australian equity   managers earned superior risk-adjusted returns in the period, however active   managers perform in line with market indices for balanced funds and   Australian bond funds.   A number of manager characteristics are also found to predict risk-adjusted   excess returns, systematic risk and investment expenses. Of particular note,   performance of balanced funds is negatively related to the institution's age   and the loyalty of non-senior investment staff. Performance is also found to   be significantly higher for managers that predominantly operate their   portfolios using a bottom-up, stock selection approach. Interestingly, the   human capital of managers, measured as the years of tertiary education   undertaken, does not explain risk-adjusted excess returns. Systematic risk   is positively related to an institutions age and negatively related to both   senior manager loyalty and the implementation of bottom-up portfolio   management strategies. In terms of management expenses, fees are directly   related to the Australian equities benchmark allocation, the years of   tertiary education, the number of years service (loyalty) for non-senior   investment professionals and the total years experience of senior money   managers. This concluding essay also documents that changes in top   management have significant performance effects. In the 12-month period   after a change in fixed income director or chief investment officer,   performance is significantly lower and significantly higher, respectively.   There is no significant difference in performance where changes in top   management occur for Australian equities. The years of service (loyalty)   provided to asset management firms by equities directors is inversely related   to risk-adjusted return.   The fifth and final essay examines the investment performance of active   Australian bond funds and the impact of investor fund flows on portfolio   returns. This essay represents a significant and original analysis in terms   of its contribution to the literature, given the absence of Australian bond   fund performance analytics and also the limited attention provided in the   U.S. Both security selection and market timing performance is evaluated   using both unconditional models and conditional performance evaluation   techniques, which account for public information and the time-variation in   risk. Overall, the results of this essay are consistent with the U.S. and   international mutual fund evidence, where performance is found to be   consistent with an efficient market. While actively managed institutional   funds perform broadly in line with the index before expenses, the paper   documents significant underperformance for actively managed retail bond funds   after fees. The study also documents that retail fund flows negatively   impact on market timing coefficients when flow is not accounted for in   unconditional models.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field
