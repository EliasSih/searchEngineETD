Situated within the theoretical framework of international regime theory and Gramsci&#8217;s concept of hegemony, it uses the &#8220;Africa Information Society Initiative (AISI): An action framework to build ICT infrastructure in Africa&#8221; as its case study. Based on the empirical evidences gathered from the historical policy document analysis and qualitative semi-structured interviews, it provides a critical analysis of how the diffusion of global neoliberal agenda through the international organizations shaped the AISI policy prescriptions. It analyzes the challenges confronting the AISI implementation and ICTs for development agenda in Africa. In view of the inherent contradictions between the transnational character of the AISI and the national characters of the region, it examines the implication of these problems and suggests potential ways of addressing them. It concludes by stressing the importance of contextual local institutional forces and cultural ethos in the ICT policies and development process in Africa.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Africa, ECA, ITU, global information society</field><field name="subject">ICTs, development agenda, AISI, communication policies</field><field name="subject">Modernization, donors, leapfrogging , development</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213113</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Imbricated Identity and the Theatre Star in Early-Twentieth-Century Australasia</field><field name="creator">Martina Lipton</field><field name="description">This thesis examines in detail the construct we term the &#8216;theatre star&#8217;. It aims to investigate how transnational theatre stars in Australia and New Zealand in the early-twentieth century validated their professional eminence, social cachet and public adulation through the strategic development and manipulation of their on and off-stage personae and mediated afterlives. Rather than focus on the theatre star as a solitary icon, my theoretical approach examines the star as a valuable partner &#8211; social, professional and cultural &#8211; within the infrastructure of the theatre industry. While much research has been done to explicate theatre performers&#8217; burgeoning professional status and appeal as charismatic personalities and performance specialists, particularly in British and American contexts in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there is little investigation on the constructed identity of the star performer of early-twentieth-century Australasian theatre. The conceptual model of &#8216;imbricated identity&#8217; theorized in this study seeks to mark a shift in the field of theatre historiography. It articulates an intertextuality of performance that reaches beyond that defined by Marvin Carlson as &#8216;ghosting&#8217; inherent in theatre praxis, and by Jacky Bratton as &#8216;intertheatricality&#8217;. I propose that the validation of &#8216;personality&#8217; &#8211; the mysteriously elusive and &#8216;uncanny appeal&#8217; or &#8216;x&#8217; factor &#8211; is only one dynamic explanation for the theatre star&#8217;s popular success. The term &#8216;imbricated identity&#8217; is used to describe the cultural accretion of interleaved and overlapping depictions of the star&#8217;s identity: theatrical representations, civic persona, private self for public consumption, and posthumous legacy. These delineated images operate coterminously. They strategically coalesce and sometimes conflate, informing discursive framings of the star&#8217;s identity as variously invested in by the artiste, and his/her symbiotic partnerships with theatre management, media, spouse/s, family and the public. During the early-twentieth century the theatre star&#8217;s constructed identity became necessarily more complex with the advent of modernity&#8217;s mass-mediated communications. Printed media, radio and film increasingly revealed information about stars&#8217; public and private lives. Case studies of Nellie Stewart, Ada Reeve, Madge Elliott and Cyril Ritchard are used to explicate how theatre performers fashioned and articulated their distinct star images. All are performers identified as &#8216;Australian&#8217; at some phase of their careers, who also maintained strong international profiles, particularly in New Zealand, England and America. They performed variously in entertainments such as dance, drama, vaudeville and revue, radio, film and television. The work of these chosen subjects traverses paradigms of high and low culture: boundaries that became increasingly more fragile with modernity&#8217;s exchange and fusion of culture and commerce. The star&#8217;s image and cultural status are unstable and rely upon contextualization syncretized by the star and theatre management, professional colleagues, journalism, fans and audiences. The public, private, and professional partnerships of my chosen subjects had a significant impact on their acculturation as Australian stars on the transnational stage, and their mediated afterlives continue today to invite multiple readings of star personae.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">theatre star</field><field name="subject">imbricated identity</field><field name="subject">partnerships</field><field name="subject">performance intertexuality</field><field name="subject">star image</field><field name="subject">star persona</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hedgehog signalling in lung development and airway regeneration</field><field name="creator">Uda Ho</field><field name="description">Tumorigenesis is often caused by the dysregulation of developmental pathways that are activated during repair, a process that recapitulates development. The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is a signalling pathway essential for cell patterning and identity during embryogenesis. Activation of Hh signalling has been reported in small cell lung cancer progression, but the role of the Hh receptor, Patched1 (Ptch1), remains poorly understood. Therefore, it is imperative that we understand how Ptch1 is involved in development and tissue repair in order to understand its roles in cancer. This project aimed to study the role of Ptch1 during the branching process of lung development and in the regeneration of airway epithelial cells. A conditional knockout approach was utilised to excise Ptch1 by crossing Ptch1 conditional mice with Dermo1-Cre mice (Dermo1Cre+/-;Ptch1lox/lox), thereby activating the Hh pathway in the mesenchyme, independent of ligand. Dermo1Cre+/-;Ptch1lox/lox embryos died at E12.0 and showed secondary lung branching arrest leading to lobe formation defects. Expression of Ptch1, Gli1 and Foxf1 were shown to be upregulated in both proximal and distal lung mesenchyme, indicating inappropriate pathway activation and disruption of the Hh gradient. Fgf10 expression was spatially reduced in Dermo1Cre+/-;Ptch1lox/lox lungs and the addition of Fgf10 to these lungs in culture showed partial restoration of branching, thus Hh signalling was shown to regulate branching via Fgf10. Due to the patterning defect associated with our in vivo model, we took an in vitro approach to delete Ptch1 in lung explants cultures. This also showed reduced branching and validated that mesenchymal proliferation was enhanced after Ptch1 deletion, consistent with the previously reported role of Hh signalling in mesenchymal cell survival. Small cell lung cancer originates in the proximal lung and has been linked to aberrant repair processes. Therefore, Hh signalling in proximal airway repair was investigated. Ptch1 expressing cells were detected in the bronchial epithelium and stroma during homeostasis. But these cells were not detected following polidocanol-induced injury in the murine nasal septum and lung. However during naphthalene-induced repair, Ptch1 expressing cells were detected in the regenerating bronchial epithelium, suggesting that Hh dependent progenitors respond specifically to naphthalene-induced damage and perhaps are pulmonary neuroendocrine or variant Clara cells. Therefore, this project has provided insight into how Ptch1 patterns lung branching and lobe specification during development and also highlights the importance of Ptch1 in pulmonary epithelial regeneration.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hedgehog Signalling</field><field name="subject">patched1</field><field name="subject">Fibroblast Growth Factor</field><field name="subject">Lung Development</field><field name="subject">airway regeneration</field><field name="subject">Cell Patterning</field><field name="subject">Branching Morphogenesis</field><field name="subject">Mouse Model</field><field name="subject">polidocanol</field><field name="subject">Naphthalene</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:213098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Niue Inside Out: The Cultural Effects of Migration in Polynesia</field><field name="creator">Bryan David Phillips</field><field name="description">Abstract While Niue&#8217;s resident population is below 1,500, New Zealand&#8217;s Niuean population now exceeds 22,000. The vast and recent out-migration is resulting in many changes to on-island Niuean society and culture. Much research on Polynesian migration focuses on out-migrants and their new place of living, especially in relation to Tongan and Samoan migration. While drawing on the theoretical insights of previous research, this thesis focuses on the less researched Polynesian nation of Niue as the cultural homeland of Niuean out-migrants, to investigate how their on-island culture is changing as a result of the significant out-migration of its residents that began in the late 1960s. It uses the analytical lens of culture and migration to understand in greater detail the social and cultural changes in Niue by the contemporary migration. Using ethnographic field research the thesis examines and analyses the impact of &#8216;cultural migration&#8217; in relation to the central aspects of on-island Niuean social and cultural change, ranging from everyday life occurrences to once in a lifetime events. The thesis examines changes involving such items as language, Niuean youth haircutting and ear-piercing ceremonies, food habits, Niuean entertainment, arts and crafts, family and more. From ethnographic data collected in Niue and among the out-migrant Niuean community in New Zealand, the thesis argues that on-island Niueans are taking on the characteristics of out-migrant Niueans. Although New Zealand administered Niue for many years and still has a role in Niue&#8217;s status as a Pacific island-nation, Niueans themselves have been most responsible for the changes influencing their on-island society and culture.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">change, culture, cultural migration, diaspora, homeland, migration, Niue, Polynesia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215152</field></doc><doc><field name="title">WiggleZ: Survey design and star-formation in UV-luminous galaxies</field><field name="creator">Russell Jurek</field><field name="description">The WiggleZ Dark Energy survey is currently being carried out using the AAOmega instrument on the AAT.

As a result, high incidences of small or shriveled wheat kernels (screenings) are commonly generated and can substantially reduce grain value. Previous studies suggest the incorporation of the tiller inhibition (tin) gene can reduce the production of infertile tillers and increase kernel weight (KW). It was hypothesised that the incorporation of the tin gene into wheat germplasm may a) contribute to the maintenance of large KW and reduction in screenings (SCR) in terminal water deficit environments; and b) not be associated with a grain yield (GY) penalty in terminal water deficit environments. Thus, the major objective of this thesis was to evaluate the expression and performance of tin gene in terms of GY and SCR: 1) in different genetic backgrounds and across Australian production environments; 2) in various northern production environments which are particularly prone to terminal water deficit conditions; and 3) to determine the mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of large KW of tin lines in terminal stress conditions. To address the overall objective, populations of lines were genotyped for the presence/absence of the tin gene and were field tested. Line differences in GY, yield components, SCR and general growth and development attributes were determined in 22 field experiments conducted between 2005-2007. The experiments were grouped into those that evaluated: a large number of sister lines from four genetic backgrounds in multi-location experiments; selected lines from Silverstar population in multi-location experiments; and selected sister lines in detailed agronomic experiments examining the effect of plant density and controlled levels of water supply through the use of a rainout shelter facility. The effect of tin on GY and SCR varied with environment and genetic background. In the Brookton, Wyalkatchem and Chara background, there was no reduction in GY associated with tin in southern production environments. However, a 31% and 10%, advantage of free-tillering over reduced tillering Silverstar lines existed in the 2005 western and 2006 northern experiments respectively, and led to an average 12% reduction in GY of Silverstar tin lines. In northern experiments, tin lines in a Silverstar background produced up to 50% fewer SCR than Silverstar free-tillering lines. Averaged across experiments, KW of Silverstar tin lines was 10% greater than free-tillering lines. Based on stem number per plant, Silverstar lines were classified into three groups; the restricted (R) and semi-restricted (SR) tin and free-tillering lines attained 2.9, 3.4 and 4.8 stems per plant respectively. Expression of tin in terms of maximum stem number production was genetic background and genotype dependent, and unlike free-tillering lines, R tin lines in particular, were not as responsive to plant density. Head number per unit area rather than kernel number per head was strongly associated with KW determination. Therefore, to maximize KW under water limiting conditions it is more beneficial if high kernel number can be achieved via the production of low head number with more kernels per head, as can be achieved with the use of tin lines. The KW advantage of Silverstar R tin was associated with greater anthesis total dry matter, stem water soluble carbohydrate and nitrogen available per head relative to free-tillering lines, and thus R tin lines had more assimilate for translocation during the grain filling period. In a terminal water deficit experiment, individual KW data collected for Silverstar tin and free-tillering lines revealed that KW of tin lines (&#8776; 25 mg per kernel) was maintained for main stem to fourth tiller heads and across floret positions 1-4 within spikelets. In contrast, free-tillering lines (&#8776; 18 mg per kernel) generated small kernels across the entire plant, with the largest proportion originating from floret positions 3 and 4. Lines containing the tin gene had a greater mean KW and kernel width, and a higher frequency of wider kernels than free-tillering lines. The high frequency of large kernel widths was associated with significantly less SCR in tin lines. A strong positive association between maturity head number per plant and SCR indicated, for every fertile head produced, SCR increased by 11% in the terminal water deficit experiment. Reduction in SCR in the Silverstar tin material in the north, was associated with high KW and a tendency for lower GY, although tin lines with equivalent GY to Silverstar could be identified in each environment. The incorporation of the tin gene has the potential to significantly reduce the incidence of SCR in commercial wheat crops. The reduction in GY associated with the tin gene was dependent on genetic background, suggesting the potential for selection of higher-yielding tin progeny in commercial line development. However, a tailored agronomic package to optimize yield potential of tin lines needs to be developed for different target environments. With the incorporation of the tin gene into genetic material adapted to the northern wheat belt and optimisation of head density, there exists scope for simultaneous improvements in GY and KW and subsequent reduction in SCR for terminal water deficit environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drought, dryland agriculture, water stress, multi-environment experiments, grain size, kernel width</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Photochemical and Biological Activity of Novel Nitroxide-Containing Photosensitisers</field><field name="creator">Nicole A Blinco</field><field name="description">This PhD project has explored the use of novel nitroxide annulated porphyrinic macrocycles as photosensitisers (PSs) for photodynamic therapy (PDT). The PSs have been synthesised, structurally, photophysically and photochemically characterised and investigated biologically through cell assays to determine their potential as photoactivated anticancer drugs. Tetra-nitroxide annulated phthalocyanines (Pcs) were initially investigated. Each of these compounds exhibit four annulated nitroxide-containing rings in a rigid, planar arrangement with fixed distance and geometry with respect to the macrocycle core, which is a novel structural motif in Pc chemistry. The presence of the nitroxides purportedly has two effects: to quench fluorescence and to increase photochemical singlet oxygen production by the compound. While nitroxides, as paramagnetic compounds, are non-fluorescent, their reduction to diamagnetic hydroxylamines results in an increased fluorescence yield. In this way, the nitroxide Pcs can potentially be used as probes for metabolic activity in biological systems, where the primary fate of the nitroxide moiety is reduction. Here, the fluorescence properties of the nitroxide-annulated Pcs were investigated through reduction of the nitroxide moieties by biologically significant reductants and calculation of fluorescence quantum yields. The singlet oxygen quantum yields of the Pcs were determined by two methods, the chemical trapping of singlet oxygen and the direct observation of singlet oxygen luminescence. While the quantum yields of the Pcs were promising when compared to clinically relevant PSs, the tetra-nitroxide Pcs did not exhibit increased quantum yields with respect to their nitroxide-free analogues. Additionally, there was minimal photodynamic action in cell assays. Subsequent fluorescence microscopy confirmed that this was most probably due to the fact that the Pcs were not localising within the cells. To improve the photodynamic action of the Pcs, two polymer-based delivery strategies were employed to enhance their delivery in biological environments. Firstly, the nitroxide Pcs were coupled to linear polymers to create polymer Pc hybrids. The second method involved the encapsulation of the nitroxide Pcs within polymer-based micelles. The synthesis of the polymer Pc hybrids was via a fast and efficient Atom Transfer Nitroxide Radical Coupling (ATNRC) reaction. The hybrids were synthesised as Mg, Zn or free-base (2H) Pc complexes, with either hydrophobic or hydrophilic polymer arms. The hybrids displayed high fluorescence quantum yields and reasonable singlet oxygen quantum yields. Again, these attributes this did not extend to any cell growth inhibition, even for the hydrophilic derivatives. Micellisation of the Pcs with a poly(styrene)-poly(acrylic acid) (PSty-PAA) star diblock copolymer afforded micelles with a range of concentrations of Pcs encapsulated within the glassy PSty core. Fluorescence studies showed that the micelles protected the nitroxide moieties from reduction by ascorbate, a result that could find application in EPR imaging and oximetry. During singlet oxygen experiments, the micelles were found to perform as nanoreactors, supramolecular assemblies which provide a reaction volume for other reagents. Pcs in the micelle cores effectively generated singlet oxygen and while this failed to escape the micelles, it was very effective in the oxidation of a hydrophobic model compound. Although there are potential applications for the micelle systems in waste-water remediation, these systems were ineffective in the PDT assays. With the difficulties associated with the biological delivery of the nitroxide Pcs in mind, hydrophilic mono-nitroxide annulated porphyrazine (Pz) macrocycles were designed and synthesised. Pzs exhibit many of the favourable optical properties of the Pcs. Synthesis of these compounds proceeded via Linstead macrocyclisation to give the target MgPz with A3B type substitution. A nitroxide-free A4 Pz was also isolated as a side-product. Transmetallation and/or hydrolysis gave access to Mg and Zn A3B and A4 carboxylate Pzs. These compounds were structurally characterised and their fluorescence characteristics investigated. The 1O2 quantum yields of the Pzs were also studied. Significantly, nitroxide annulation was found to enhance 1O2 generation of the Pzs relative to nitroxide-free analogues. The Zn carboxylate Pzs were shown to effectively inhibit the growth of tumour cell lines in PDT assay and the MgA4 carboxylate displayed strong 2-photon fluorescence within the cytoplasm of NFF cells. Experiments on freshly excised skin showed the carboxylate Pzs to be highly effective 2-photon PSs for PDT. In conclusion, we have identified several carboxylate Pzs which should be tested further in in vivo PDT experiments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">phthalocyanine</field><field name="subject">nitroxide</field><field name="subject">porphyrazine</field><field name="subject">polymer</field><field name="subject">profluorescence</field><field name="subject">singlet oxygen</field><field name="subject">photodynamic therapy</field><field name="subject">2-photon photodynamic therapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oxytocin and oxytocic substance in blood and hypothalamus : being an investigation of (a) oxytocin and oxytocic substance in extracts of blood and hypothalami : and (b) and "enzyme" in blood and placental extracts which destroys oxytocin, antidi</field><field name="creator">Hawker, Ross Wilson, d. 1996.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">11 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="subject">110202 Haematology</field><field name="subject">Blood -- Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Oxytocin.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytogenetics and speciation in Drosophila tetrachaeta Angus.</field><field name="creator">Angus, Donald Scott.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cytogenetics.</field><field name="subject">Drosophila.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215431</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance characteristics of ammonium nitrate/fuel explosives</field><field name="creator">Hagan, T.

A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling cardiac activation from cell to body surface</field><field name="creator">Buist, Martin L.</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the forward problem of electrocardiography is investigated from a cellular level through to potentials on the surface of the torso. This integrated modelling framework is based on three spatial scales. At the smallest spatial resolution, several cardiac cellular models are implemented that are used to represent the underlying cellular electrophysiology. A bidomain framework is used to couple multiple individual cells together and this provides a mathematical model of the myocardial tissue. The cardiac geometry is described using finite elements with high order cubic Hermite basis function interpolation. An anatomically based description of the fibrous laminar cardiac microstructure is then defined relative to the geometric mesh. Within the local element space of the cardiac finite elements, a fine collocation mesh is created on which the bidomain equations are solved. Each collocation point represents a continuum cell and contains a cellular model to describe the local active processes. This bidomain implementation works in multiple coordinate systems and over deforming domains, in addition to having the ability to spatially vary any parameter throughout the myocardium. On the largest spatial scale the passive torso regions surrounding the myocardium are modelled using a generalised Laplace equation to describe the potential field and current flows. The torso regions are discretised using either finite elements or boundary elements depending on the electrical properties of each region. The cardiac region is coupled to the surrounding torso through several methods. A traditional dipole source approach is implemented that creates equivalent cardiac sources through the summation of cellular dipoles. These dipoles are then placed within a homogeneous cardiac region and the resulting potential field is calculated throughout the torso. Two new coupling techniques are developed that provide a more direct path from cellular activation to body surface potentials. One approach assembles all of the equations from the passive torso regions and the equations from the extracellular bidomain region into a single matrix system. Coupling conditions based on the continuity of potential and current flow across the myocardial surfaces are used to couple the regions and therefore solving the matrix system yields a solution that is continuous across all of the solution points within the torso. The second approach breaks the large system into smaller subproblems and the continuity conditions are iii iv imposed through an iterative approach. Across each of the myocardial surfaces, a fixed point iteration is set up with the goal of converging towards zero potential and current flow differences between adjacent regions. All of the numerical methods used within the integrated modelling framework are rigorously tested individually before extensive tests are performed on the coupling techniques. Large scale simulations are run to test the dipole source approach against the new coupling techniques. Several sets of simulations are run to investigate the effects of using different ionic current models, using different bidomain model simplifications, and the role that the torso inhomogeneities play in generating body surface potentials. The main question to be answered by this study is whether or not the traditional approach of combining a monodomain heart with an equivalent cardiac source in a two step approach is adequate when generating body surface potentials. Comparisons between the fully coupled framework developed here and several dipole based approaches demonstrate that the resulting sets of signals have different magnitudes and different waveform shapes on both the torso and epicardial surface, clearly illustrating the inadequacy of the equivalent cardiac source models. It has been found that altering the modelling assumptions on each spatial scale produces noticeable effects. At the smallest scale, the use of different cell models leads to significantly different body surface potential traces. At the next scale the monodomain approach is unable to accurately reproduce the results from a full bidomain framework, and at the largest level the inclusion of different torso inhomogeneities has a large effect on the magnitude of the torso and epicardial potentials. Adding a pair of lungs to the torso model changes the epicardial potentials by an average of 16% which is consistent with the experimental range of between 8 and 20%. This provides evidence that only a complex, coupled, biophysically based model will be able to properly reproduce clinical ECGs.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2133</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Stratigraphy and taxonomy of the Upper Triassic bivalve Monotis in New Zealand.</field><field name="creator">Grant-Mackie, J.A.(John Augustus)</field><field name="description">Some 2500 specimens of Monotis from more than 500 localities within New Zealand were studied by statistical and traditional descriptive methods. From this analysis 20 taxa are recognised as constituting the New Zealand Monotis fauna, with the future possible addition of two further taxa. M. richmondiana Zittel, claimed by some overseas workers as a junior synonym of M. ochotica (Keyserling), is established as validly separable and is seen to include Trechmann's (1918) Pseudomonotis ochotica var. acutecostata as a subspecies. The presence of the New Caledonian M. routhieri and M. ochotica gigantea (Avias, 1953) is confirmed and the latter is transferred to M. subcircularis Gabb. Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica and var. intermedia (of Trechmann, 1918) are reinstated as valid taxa and given full specific rank. M. calvata Marwick (1953) is retained as a full species. In addition, the following species and subspecies are proposed: awakinoensis, kiritehereensis, maniapotoi, marwicki, murihikuensis, murihikuensis taringatura, pinensis aotearoa, rauparaha, rauparaha aries, rauparaha mokaui, subcircularis discordans, wairakae, and warepana. Only Pseudomonotis richmondiana var. truncata Frech (1908) amongst names previously proposed for New Zealand Monotis is rejected as a nomen dubium; it is probably synonymous with M. richmondiana acutecostata (Trechmann). The species-group concept of Westermann (1973b) is formalised by the proposal of five subgeneric divisions to accommodate the 55 definite and up to 5 possible taxa included in the genus. The subgenera Monotis, Entomonotis Marwick (type: M. richmondiana), Eomonotis n.subgen. (type: Pseudomonotis scutiformis var. typica Kiparisova), Inflatomonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis salinaria var. hemispherica Trechmann), and Maorimonotis n.subgen. (type: Monotis routhieri) are differentiated on the basis of adult size, prominence and sculpture of the posterior auricle, the degree to which it is separated from the disc, shell inflation, radial ribbing and shell thickness. Eomonotis is the oldest subgenus and the stem-stock for the others; it probably evolved from Otapiria. It is unclear from morphologic evidence whether Monotis (s.s.) and Entomonotis developed one from the other or both from Eomonotis independently. Maorimonotis is confidently believed to have sprung from an Entomonotis similar to M. pachypleura (Teller) and Inflatomonotis is most likely to have evolved from an Eomonotis with strongly inflated left valve (e.g. M. jakutica (Teller) or M. iwaiensis Ichikawa). Eomonotis and Entomonotis are geographically the most widespread, the former being absent only from the Andean area of Monotis distribution and Entomonotis not having been recorded in the western or central Tethys. Monotis (s.s.) is common only in the western Tethys. Inflatomonotis and Maorimonotis are confined to New Zealand-New Caledonia except for one record of the former in British Columbia. In many regions the stratigraphic sequence of Monotis is too inadequately known for evolutionary sequences to be deduced but some examples of chronologic and geographic subspeciation are pinpointed. The only clearly defined lineage is that within Maorimonotis from maniapotoi through awakinoensis and routhieri to calvata. The genus can be seen to have a high taxonomic diversity and rapid rate of evolution. Apart from three questionable lower Triassic and lower Jurassic species, Monotis is confined to the Norian Stage, and possibly to the Columbianus and Suessi Zones of the mid and upper Norian. Monotis is postulated as having been epibyssate throughout life and normally epiplanktonic on drifting or floating marine vegetation, with coexisting taxa occupying different microenvironments on different parts of the plants. A serious objection to this mode of life is the massive algal production necessary to provide a substrate for the tremendous numbers of individuals involved in Monotis shellbeds. Reduction of the byssal ear in Maorimonotis is seen as a significant event and coupled with the trend to an equivalved condition is interpreted as indicating change to an endobyssate benthic existence for M. routhieri and calvata; this adequately explains the restricted distribution of this subgenus. Detailed stratigraphic analysis of Monotis in Murihiku sequences necessitates rejection of the Rocky Dome section as stratotype for the Warepan Stage on the grounds that although M. richmondiana has been cited as the marker fossil for the stage, past usage has clearly equated the base of the stage with the incoming of the genus, and richmondiana is not the oldest member of the genus to be found in Murihiku sections. Earlier members are absent from the stratotype which therefore must be relocated in order to retain the stage in its accepted scope. The Kiritehere coastal section suffers the disadvantage of penecontemporaneous submarine slumping, but is proposed as stratotype for a new Marakopan Stage because it is the thickest, best exposed, clearest and best known sequence of Monotis beds and adjacent strata in New Zealand. Within this stage a sequence of five formal and three informal chronozones is defined. The lower Marakopan Mokaui and Murihikuensis Chronozones can be grouped together as an Eomonotis chronozone when faunas are too poor for better correlation, and similarly the overlying Acutecostata, Richmondiana and Calvata Chronozones can be grouped as an Entomonotis chronozone. In addition a topmost Marakopan chronozone can be recognised from the absence of Monotis and basal Otapirian indicators and the presence of a fauna which at present seems common to the two stages. Monotis is the most common fossil in the Torlesse Super-group and the lower four Chronozones, and probably also the Calvata Chronozone, are all represented. Most forms present in Murihiku rocks are also present in Torlesse, but two common Torlesse forms are unknown in Murihiku sequences and this is believed to indicate both communication and barriers between the two regions in Marakopan times. Monotis-bearing Torlesse lithologies are more varied than Murihiku and indicate different depositional regimes. Whilst Murihiku Marakopan strata are all of normal clastic lithologies and show a southwards increase in grain-size, the Torlesse picture is more complex. Firstly, an increasingly deeper and offshore situation is suggested by some deposits with Murihiku faunas: inner or middle neritic origin for Monotis-bearing clasts in a (?) late Jurassic conglomerate at Morrinsville which possibly accumulated in the outer neritic zone or slightly deeper, outer neritic for in situ strata near Aria, slightly further offshore accumulation for ? middle Jurassic m&#233;lange in the Oroua Valley and Marakopan slump deposits in the Otaki Gorge, and bathyal or even abyssal deposition for argillites with scattered Monotis in the Mt Arthur-Bealey area. The Aria Monotis beds lie west of the Waipa Fault, yet fit best into Kear's (1967, 1971) Morrinsville Facies, and indicate that the Hakarimata Anticline, Waipa Fault and the facies relations postulated by Kear date from the mid-Jurassic and that there was no feature like the modern continental edge and slope during upper Triassic times in the region. Close paleogeographic relations between these areas and the Murihiku region in Marakopan times is indicated and is not disproven by any sedimentologic evidence yet known. One lithologic association not represented in and showing distinct geographic separation from the Murihiku area is the shell limestone-submarine lava-chert association, which is that containing Monotis species endemic to the Torlesse. This is postulated as having been formed in localised offshore shoal areas (guyots) formed by submarine volcanism; even these regions had some connection with Murihiku seas.</field><field name="date">1975</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2580</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation of colour perception through dynamic ICC profile modification : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science at Massey University, Albany (Auckland), New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Kloss, Guy Kristoffer</field><field name="description">Digital colour cameras are dramatically falling in price, making them a ordable for ubiquitous appliances in many applications. Change in colour perception with changing light conditions induce errors that may escape a user's awareness. Colour constancy algorithms are based on inferring light properties (usually the white point) to correct colour. Other attempts using more data for colour correction   such as (ICC based) colour management   characterise a capturing device under given conditions through an input device pro le. This pro le can be applied to correct for deviating colour perception. But this pro le is only valid for the speci c conditions at the time of the characterisation, but fails with changes in light. This research presents a solution to the problem of long time observations with changes in the scene's illumination for common natural (overcast or clear, blue sky) and arti cial sources (incandescent or  uorescent lamps). Colour measurements for colour based reasoning need to be represented in a robustly de ned way. One such suitable and well de ned description is given by the CIE LAB colour space, a device-independent, visually linearised colour description. Colour transformations using ICC pro le are also based on CIE colour descriptions. Therefore, also the corrective colour processing has been based on ICC based colour management. To verify the viability of CIE LAB based corrective colour processing colour constancy algorithms (White Patch Retinex and Grey World Assumption) have been modi ed to operate on L a b  colour tuples. Results were compared visually and numerically (using colour indexing) against those using the same algorithms operating on RGB colour tuples. We can take advantage of the fact that we are dealing with image streams over time, adding another dimension usable for analysis. A solution to the problem of slowly changing light conditions in scenes with a static camera perspective is presented. It takes advantage of the small (frame-to-frame) changes in appearance of colour within the scene over time. Reoccurring objects or (background) areas of the scene are tracked to gather data points for an analysis. As a result, a suitable colour space distortion model has been devised through a  rst order Taylor approximation (a ne transformation). By performing a multidimensional linear regression analysis on the tracked data points, parameterisations for the a ne transformations were derived. Finally, the device pro le is updated by amalgamating the corrections from the model into the ICC pro le for a single, comprehensive transformation. Following applications of the ICC based colour pro les are very fast and can be used in real-time with the camera's capturing frame rate (for current normal web cameras and low spec desktop computers). As light conditions usually change on a much slower time scale than the capturing rate of a camera, the computationally expensive pro le adaptation generally showed to be usable for many frames. The goal was to set out and  nd a solution for consistent colour capturing using digital cameras, which is capable of coping with changing light conditions. Theoretical backgrounds and strategies for such a system have been devised and implemented successfully.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer colour image processing</field><field name="subject">Colour perception</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences::280200 Artificial Intelligence and Signal and Image Processing::280208 Computer vision</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Knowledge management and contract professionals: A study of contingent employment and knowledge sharing in organisations</field><field name="creator">Rao, Sujatha</field><field name="description">Doctor of Philosophy</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">Contract professionals</field><field name="subject">Professional identities</field><field name="subject">Knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">Contingent employment</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2123/6631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Occupational Structure on Economic Performance in Australia</field><field name="creator">Jerome Clayton BREDT</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:135540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting milk protein concentration and composition of dairy cattle in the sub-tropical regions of northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">David Graham BARBER</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge of Their Seats: The Novel Manuscript 'Frantic', and the critical essay 'Suspense in Fiction: Its Operation and Techniques'</field><field name="creator">Howell, Katherine Leslie</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of the critical essay and the creative project. The critical essay is an investigation into the nature of narrative suspense, its operation, and the techniques by which an author can develop it. Narrative suspense requires that readers care for characters and feel uncertain about events. An author can use a number of story-telling techniques to make the most of this emotion and uncertainty. Readers may embark on a variety of activities including imagining outcomes and piecing together clues, and these too can be utilised by the author to build suspense. Following the examination of the subject, I explore the development of the drafts of Frantic with particular emphasis on how my research into suspense changed my approach to characterisation, structure, and the process of writing. The creative project is the manuscript Frantic, a crime thriller set in present-day Sydney. When Paramedic Sophie Phillips&#146; husband Chris is shot and their baby kidnapped, Detective Ella Marconi struggles to solve the case. Evidence suggests the act may be revenge by a bereaved father for Sophie&#146;s failure to save a mother and her newborn, and equally that senior constable Chris may have been involved in the police corruption that increasingly appears rife. Distraught Sophie knows what she believes, and when the police fail to find her son she takes matters into her own hands.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400103 Professional Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater dynamics and the salinity structure in sandy beaches</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Nick</field><field name="description">Groundwater dynamics in beaches have been investigated through field and laboratory experiments. The observations have been used to test the ability of currently available mathematical and numerical models to adequately account for the influence of processes such as vertical flow and capillarity. New 1D sand column experiments have been conducted to examine the influence of a truncated capillary fringe on periodic water table oscillations. As the fringe becomes increasingly truncated the aquifer storage term, the complex effective porosity n &#969;, is substantially reduced in agreement with previous findings under steady flow conditions. The findings are a useful starting point for an investigation of the dynamics of the water table exit point in beaches where the water table lies just below the sand surface. A simple 2D laboratory aquifer, influenced by finite-depth and capillarity effects, subject to simple harmonic periodic forcing has been used to investigate the dispersion of the water table waves. The performance of existing dispersion relation theories, accounting for both capillarity and finite-depth effects, deteriorates at higher oscillation frequencies suggesting that other, neglected processes have some influence. Horizontal flow in the capillary fringe is suggested as such a process. The generation of higher harmonics due to a sloping beach face is also investigated in the laboratory. The observations reveal that the generation process is strongest near the sand surface, likely to be due to vertical flows into the aquifer being strongest near the sand surface. A 2DV numerical model is applied to the data and does well in predicting the nature of the generation process, qualitatively reproducing the variation in oscillation amplitude with depth in the inter-tidal zone. Application of a modified Boussinesq equation to estimate aquifer recharge due to infiltration from wave runup is critically applied to field and laboratory measurements. Finite amounts of flux across the water table are seen at, and landward of, the runup limit where there is zero infiltration at the sand surface. This suggests that the capillary fringe and vertical flows in this region are significant and that application of the model be undertaken with care. Field observations of the salinity structure and its response to ocean forcing reveal no response to tidal forcing but a significant response to a wave-induced pulse in groundwater levels. The infiltration of salty ocean water due to infiltration from wave runup is shown to reverse the traditional &#147;salt-wedge&#148; scenario in the surficial aquifer with a thin salty layer overlying the fresh water.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290801 Structural Engineering</field><field name="subject">680203 Civil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy.

The study is situated primarily in the area of the history of Christian thought and is located in the area of modern Enlightenment Studies. Wesley&#146;s role as a pastoral theologian is established and his theological methodology uncovered from the perspective of his holistic vision of the God-human relationship being centred in love. This lays the foundation for an examination of his theological sources and tools derived from his extensive writings. Their interaction is explored through an examination of the doctrine and practice of Christian perfection as Wesley offered pastoral guidance to the people called Methodists. There is extensive debate within Methodist circles (particularly in North America) regarding the conception and utility of Wesley&#146;s theological method. Albert C. Outler was the key scholar who identified the components of the Wesleyan quadrilateral (Scripture, reason, tradition and experience) and proposed it as a unique and fruitful conception, with invaluable application for the Methodist movement today. Outler&#146;s claims have been much debated and in many quarters rejected, though his basic understanding remains well-established within influential sections of the church. This thesis is an examination of Wesley&#146;s writings in the light of the current debate to see if a more productive model can be established that will have greater resonance in a postmodern setting. After an overview of the scholarly debate on Wesley&#146;s location and theological method in the eighteenth century, the major focus is Wesley&#146;s own extensive writings over the course of his ministry. This is examined in three periods: 1725-39, 1740-69 and 1770-91. The study seeks to discover for each period his conception of the God-human relationship and what this implies for his theological method. The sources and tools Wesley utilised are then identified, before attention is turned to an examination of Christian perfection as a doctrine and its application in pastoral practice. The study has found that the common assessment of Wesley as a pastoral theologian is correct and this has implications for his approach to theologising. Wesley viewed the core characteristic of God&#146;s nature as love and the God-human relationship is to be defined by the qualities of trust and passion, rather than an intellectual comprehension of propositional truths about God. In his theological method Scripture, reason, community ethos and Christian experience are utilised in an interconnected dynamic network, energised by the presence of the Holy Spirit. God is clearly the sole theological authority and the components of the system are the means he uses for communication. This analysis emphasises the fundamental nature of Christianity as a relationship of love, based on trust rather than an intellectual comprehension of doctrine; it is essentially a matter of the heart rather than the head. Accordingly, pastoral theology is much more important than academic, systematic theology for Christian experience and spiritual formation. Theological method must be shaped by this understanding, and so personal knowledge is always to be valued over intellectual propositions; Christian belief concerns the encounter with God as a Person rather than the mastery of a comprehensive system of doctrines. Critical to this process is the ethos of the community, which is the intimate blending of all the elements under the guidance of the Spirit. This makes Christian experience, rather than merely life experience, of vital importance. Because love and relationships are not reducible to mechanical systems that are merely intellectually comprehended, there is an element of mystery that remains. There is a difference in the way that the Spirit utilises the means when working with the doctrinal substance and the experiential circumstance of Christian perfection. The Modernist approach that is focused on dissection and analysis results in the loss of this holistic, dynamic system and its reduction to either pure subjectivism or rationalism. Wesley&#146;s theological method is much closer to the pre-Modern approach that has been prevalent for most of history and more in harmony with much of the present developments in postmodern thought.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression in the human brain: adaptive changes associated with tobacco and alcohol exposure</field><field name="creator">Flatscher-Bader, Traute</field><field name="description">Alcohol and tobacco are drugs of abuse which are legal to sell and consume in most western societies. Addiction to these two substances has major social and health implications worldwide. The brain structure known to mediate addictive behaviour is the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system. Dopaminegic neurons arise from the ventral tegmental area, project to the nucleus accumbens and interact with the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic alcoholism elicits marked damage in the prefrontal cortex with significant loss of neurons and glia. The key components of addiction, tolerance and dependence, are thought to be the result of semipermanent adaptive changes in gene expression. Gene expression profiling of the mesocorticolimbic system from human alcoholics and alcohol-dependent animals has revealed highly region-specific alterations. How these molecular changes result in the development of alcohol dependence in humans is not fully understood. Complicating factors in human alcoholism include a high comorbidity with smoking, socioeconomic factors and the prevalence of underlying psychological pathologies. Gene expression profiling of the prefrontal cortex of six alcoholics and six controls resulted in the identification of functional gene groups sensitive to alcoholism. Mitochondrial function was found down regulated while mRNA levels of genes involved in stress response and cell protection were elevated. These results correlate with the pathology of the prefrontal cortex in chronic alcoholism. Some of the control cases used for gene expression profiling were later identified as chronic smokers, while all of the alcoholics were heavy smokers. To date the heavy co-morbidity of alcoholism with smoking has not been taken into account. Thus the expression of selected genes were investigated by realtime PCR in an extended case set of non-smoking alcoholics, smoking alcoholics, smoking non-alcoholics and non-smoking, non-alcoholics. This study revealed that alcoholism itself had a significant impact on the expression of midkine, the high affinity glial glutamate transporter, member 1 and the tissue inhibitor of the metalloproteinase 3. Heavy smoking itself led to a small but significant elevation of MDK mRNA levels as well as an increase in variation of excitatory amino acid transporter 1 and metalloproteinase inhibitor, member 3 expression. Apolipoprotein D however was induced by chronic smoking but not by alcohol dependence. These results highlight the need of careful case selection in future studies on gene expression in the human alcoholic brain. Peptide antibodies were produced to midkine and a polyclonal antibody against the excitatory amino acid transporter 1 was obtained from a collaborating laboratory. Western blots utilizing these antibodies revealed a marked increase in midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 protein in alcoholics compared to non-smoking and non-drinking controls. In coronal sections of human prefrontal cortex of alcoholics and non-smoking non-drinking controls, immunofluorescence of midkine was obtained from nuclei throughout the layers of the cortex and from the cell bodies of a distinct set of astrocytes in cortical layer II. Double staining with glial fibrillary acidic protein revealed that a portion of midkine-positive nuclei were localised in glial cells. There was no difference in immunostaining of alcohol and control sections with midkine. In summary these results indicate that midkine protein is induced in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. However, this increase in protein may not be strong enough to be visualised by immunohistochemistry. Midkine induction may be reflective of reparative processes in the prefrontal cortex of the chronic alcoholic. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in non-alcoholic, non-smoking control cases were obtained as a confluent band in cortical layer II and sparsely in deeper cortical layers. Excitatory amino acid transporter 1 immunoreactivity overlapped partially with glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling. In chronic alcoholics, excitatory amino acid transporter 1 staining in the area between the cortical layer II and VI was significantly increased. At withdrawal, glutamate levels may reach toxic levels in the cortex. The increase in cells expressing excitatory amino acid transporter 1 throughout the cortical layers may indicate a protective measure of this brain region in the chronic alcoholic. Additionally, layer specific expression of midkine and excitatory amino acid transporter 1 in the prefrontal cortex of the healthy individual may implicate a specialised role of these astrocytes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">gene expression</field><field name="subject">brain chemistry</field><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">tobacco</field><field name="subject">drug dependency</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating re-purchase intention in an experiential context using operations and marketing perspectives</field><field name="creator">Hume, Margee</field><field name="description">Abstract The purpose of this thesis is to undertake theory development and testing particular to re-purchase intention in an experiential service context, specifically the cultural performing arts. Services researchers suggest implementing a multi-disciplinary approach to research that uses theories and methods from several of the management fields will advance the domain of services research. This thesis aims to contribute to the field of service research by drawing from methods and theories offered in both service operations and services marketing fields. To date, service research has been preoccupied primarily with consumer behaviour aspects of services marketing such as satisfaction but underestimates the importance of constructs such as re-purchase intention and the subsequent implications for strategy formulation and implementation. Further to this, the current approach to services research has overlooked the nexus between marketing and operations and the importance of the implementation of strategy to achieve objectives. It is argued that failing to integrate service operations both practically and theoretically into the re-purchase intentions research framework confines its potential effectiveness. In addition, the lack of specific service context application has been identified as a significant oversight in previous services research. Construct measurements and findings have been difficult to replicate across contexts and contextual examination of constructs and relationships has been suggested as a solution. One such context deserving of attention is that of the experiential services, specifically the performing arts. Therefore, using measures and theories developed specifically for this context, this thesis will offer a more comprehensive approach to re-purchase intention research in a performing arts setting. This thesis adopts a mixed method approach by implementing a series of three integrated studies, which amalgamates both operations and marketing fields. This thesis aims to identify the aspects of a performing arts encounter that are relevant to the customer by conducting a two-staged set of qualitative interviews. This process is based on the operations technique Service Transaction Analysis (STA). First, consultant consumers and organisational personnel were used to formulate a consensus definition of a typical performing arts experience and, second, 26 in-depth interviews were conducted with potential future consumers of the performing arts based on this description of the offering. These two studies, coupled with extant literature, informed the research instrument designed for the main survey. This instrument was conducted on 273 potential future consumers of the performing arts. Qualitative work undertaken in Study 1 identifies the service experience description. Study 2 highlights the service management and marketing issues relating to re-purchase intention especially focusing on value, customer satisfaction, show experience and service quality and discloses a set of specific issues incorporated into the wording of the survey instrument. Study 3 measures and tests the key constructs of service quality, show experience, value, satisfaction and the significance of the hypothesised pathways to re-purchase intention. The proposed model is then analysed using the AMOS 5.0 Structural Equation Modelling package. This thesis is structured in the journal paper format with each of the chapters representing each of the five journal papers. In addition, an introductory and concluding chapter are appended with the concluding chapter providing an in-depth discussion of the contributions of this thesis. The papers are based on the progressive results of the research program and offer an integrated set of findings and discussions. The papers are not mutually exclusive but interrelated to comprehensively illuminate the central research theme of the thesis and discuss many aspects of marketing and operations significant to re-purchase intention. The entire thesis is drawn from the data set generated from the three integrated studies developed to address the overall research theme. The central research theme is to investigate the nature of re-purchase intention in an experiential setting using marketing and operations theories as platforms of analysis. Interestingly, the tested model of this thesis found empirically that the subjective and experiential aspects of the service, such as the emotional and artistic quality of the show, did not have a significant and direct relationship with re-purchase intention. This finding is of interest, in particular, to scholars of experiential consumption and marketing practitioners offering these types of services. Previous research has supported the desire to fulfil experiential needs as driving the initial purchase. Conversely, this finding suggests that the desire to visit again is driven by utility and value. As customer maintenance and repeat patronage are of utmost importance to practice, this is an exciting development. Offering further support, the tested model found service quality and show experience were mediated by value to satisfaction, with satisfaction inturn mediating the relationship between value and re-purchase intention. Collectively, these findings have lead to several developments and contributions for both scholarship and practice. The contributions to knowledge of this thesis highlight five main theoretical contributions and four main managerial implications. These encompass: &#183; Advancing the &#145;service management trinity&#146;, specifically strengthening the importance of the relationship between service marketing and service operations. &#183; Advancing service management theory by understanding the service offering more intricately and the importance of service description. &#183; Clarifying the roles of experiential and utilitarian attributes of the service experience in an experiential setting extending knowledge related to re-purchase intention. &#183; Particularizing and measuring the construct of re-purchase intention to the performing arts and clarifying the predictors of this construct in the context of experiential performing arts. . &#183; Testing and clarifying the relationships of value and satisfaction to re-purchase intention extending the understanding of re-purchase intention in this field and elaborating the approach and understanding of this construct for future research. This thesis further contributes to knowledge by offering several managerial contributions. These incorporate: &#183; Market segmentation and targeting strategies as critical for performing arts management. &#183; Operations service design and creation strategies in the performing arts by including important aspects of the service experience as highlighted by customer driven research. &#183; Specific recommendation for streamlining delivery through standardised mass customisation. &#183; Offering value frameworks for creating value in service delivery and targeting customer perceptions of superior value. This extending the understanding of the customer perceived value equation. By contributing to the field of service management and advancing enquiry in the field of services marketing and service operations, this thesis offers a new perspective and practical approach to service marketing context analysis making a valuable contribution to scholarship. This approach is based on improving organisational performance in experiential services specifically by applying operations and marketing theory from a customer-perspective. By doing this, findings inform organisations of ways to better meet the needs and wants of consumers through design, delivery and marketing. Moreover, the findings assist researchers in further advancing the field of services research. This research positions the future research program to focus on continuing the advancement of service management by examining the higher order constructs of service quality and show experience and examining the impact of additional customer motivations such as emotional goal attainment and involvement in experiential settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">720401 Marketing</field><field name="subject">350204 Marketing and Market Research</field><field name="subject">services marketing</field><field name="subject">services operations</field><field name="subject">performing arts</field><field name="subject">service quality</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In/visibility: Women looking at men's bodies in and through contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="creator">Bode, Katherine</field><field name="description">Masculinity is an increasingly prominent and important issue in debates within feminism, literary studies and visual theory. This study intervenes in and contributes to such debates by analysing an emerging group of Australian women&#146;s fictions (published between 1998 and 2002) which focus on male characters and, in particular, on the description and narrative potential of their bodies. The majority of these texts, and the ones that are explored in this thesis &#150; namely, Jillian Watkinson&#146;s The Architect, Georgia Blain&#146;s The Blind Eye, Mireille Juchau&#146;s Machines for Feeling, Fiona Capp&#146;s Last of the Sane Days, Sarah Myles&#146;s Transplanted and Wendy Scarfe&#146;s Miranda &#150; share two preoccupations. Firstly, male characters bodies&#146; are almost always damaged or suffering in some way; secondly, the ability (or inability) of female characters to look at these bodies is repeatedly foregrounded. I argue that the interactions between male characters&#146; bodies and female characters&#146; gazes function in complex ways both to confirm and to challenge patriarchal constructions of masculinity and male corporeality. Specifically, this occurs in relation to the engagement of each text with popular discourses of feminism and masculinity crisis, discourses that emerge and interact in complex and often contradictory ways in depictions of male visibility and exposure. While my approach is generally feminist, it is also fiction-centred. Thus, I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, including literary theory, masculinity studies, visual theory, history, sociology and philosophy, in order to unpack and engage with these contemporary Australian women&#146;s fictions. Paradoxically, one of the main consequences of this fiction-centred approach is a reengagement with and a rethinking of theoretical concepts emerging from psychoanalytic feminist film theory. In a remarkably consistent and explicitly pedagogical way, these fictions explore notions of objectification and dichotomisation, especially as they are elucidated in Laura Mulvey&#146;s analysis of Hollywood narrative cinema. Objectification is overwhelmingly aligned with oppressive power structures and identified as problematic, and the first half of this thesis explores the novels&#146; critiques of this mode of visual interaction. The second half investigates the alternatives to objectification imagined in these fictions. While, upon closer consideration, some of these alternatives recapture male and female characters within traditional patriarchal power relations, others enable a rethinking of both women&#146;s vision and desire, and men&#146;s subjectivity, visibility and desirability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">female gaze</field><field name="subject">men's bodies</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The limits of liberal justice: Normative constraints on multicultural policies and indigenous policies in Australia</field><field name="creator">Antal, Ildiko Barbara</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the question of the extent to which theories of citizenship, especially as developed in political liberalism, help to formulate an understanding of cultural diversity in relation to political stability and justice.

In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling unplanned landscape change: A Colombian case study</field><field name="creator">Etter, Andres</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this study is, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the patterns, processes and drivers of unplanned land cover change in the tropics, using Colombia as a study case. Land cover change is an important global issue because of the expanding ecological footprint of a rapidly increasing human population and per capita level of resource consumption. This has a major impact on natural ecosystems and their function at the local (hundreds of square kilometers) and global scales. The understanding of extent and rate of land cover change is an important issue confronting biodiversity conservation, land use planning, protected area management, and global climate change analysis. Tropical deforestation is the major source of global land cover change, with the highest absolute rates occurring in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where government planning is an important driver of deforestation. However, unplanned deforestation for cropping and ranching is also occurring in Colombia. This is of international concern because Colombia&#146;s diverse ecosystems support high levels of species richness and endemism. Improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers ofland cover change (both deforestation and regeneration) is an important step in developing planning and conservation strategies to address this problem. I applied a spatial and temporal statistical modelling approach to predict changes in land cover in Colombia at the local (100 km2), regional (104 km2) and national (106 km2) levels, with a timeframe spanning from decades to centuries. As dependant variable data, binary forest/non-forest data are used. Explanatory variables comprise biophysical and socioeconomic data sourced from a broad range of information sources, including remotely sensed data from aerial photographs and satellite images, secondary sources of biophysical and socioeconomic data, and historical data. At the local-level, I addressed the deforestation process over the last 60 years using six case studies of 100 km2 of humid lowland forests, by applying logistic regression and spatial analysis. At the regional-level, I studied the deforestation in the Caquet&#225; colonization front of the Colombian Amazon region from 1988-2004 by applying a forest-cover zoning method and logistic regression models to predict deforestation and forest regeneration from biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables. At the national level, I quantified and analysed patterns and drivers of land cover change over the past 500 years for key periods of Colombian history, and identified the extent and duration of impacts on broad ecosystem types. At the national and regional-levels, I also modelled current landscape transformation patterns and predicted areas at a high risk of future deforestation using a joint logistic regression and regression tree approach. I discovered that the rate of deforestation across several lowland regions of Colombia follows a simple sigmoid pattern composed of four phases of transformation: an initial phase of gradual forest loss; an intermediate phase of rapid loss; a second intermediate phase where the rate of decline slows; and a final phase where the forest loss stabilises and is balanced by forest regeneration creating a dynamic equilibrium. At the end of this final phase, the landscape is in a highly transformed state with forest cover stabilizing at 2 to 10% of the original extent and an average forest patch size of 15.4 (&#177; 9.2) ha. As a general rule, the transformed landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of remnant mature tropical forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages that is repeatedly cleared. A second important discovery was that unplanned deforestation in the Colombian Amazon moves as a colonisation wave, extending from population centres. The rate of movement was 0.84 km.yr-1 between 1989 and 2002. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between &#150;1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%. The parallel deforestation and regeneration processes operating within the colonization front showed consistent patterns and rates directly related to the proportion of forest in the neighbourhood, with the highest rates of deforestation occurring in the areas with intermediate (40-60%) forest cover, following an overall quadratic function, and therefore confirming the sigmoid pattern across an entire colonization front. Landscapes with intermediate forest cover also have the highest density of edge habitat, with the deforestation process mimicking the spread of disease. At the national-level, the study reveals two important outcomes. First, there are significant regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of land cover change. The importance of such regional differences in factors explainingland cover change is highlighted by the greatest discrimination ability shown by a regional-level classification tree model. The coefficients and significance of variables in a regional logistic regression model confirmed these differences. Overall, factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) had the strongest influence on the probability of deforestation. The second national-level outcome highlights the need for a longer-term historical perspective spanning centuries to understand present-day landscapes and their level of human impact. The historical analysis reveals that the main drivers of landscape change varied in the early colonial period, with cattle grazing becoming increasingly important, and finally the high impact of economic globalization in the 1990s. The historic land cover maps show the transformed areas increasing from approximately 15 million ha in 1500 to 42 million ha in 2000. Also, during this period, the transformed areas changed from predominantly cropping land uses in 1500 to predominantly (&lt; 75%) grazing in 2000. The research outcomes collectively provide an understanding of the spatial dynamics of unplannedland cover change in tropical forest landscapes, by showing how deforestation and regeneration processes vary along a transformation gradient, and linking the amount of remnant forests is related to the rate of change. The work has implications for policy and management. For example, the method of calculating the movement speed of a colonization front provides a spatially explicit prediction of threat that can be used in conservation planning. The improved understanding of the deforestation and regeneration dynamics over an entire colonization fronts permits more accurate calculation of carbon budgeting for climate change applications. I recommend that future work test of the generalities presented here in both, countries with unplanned deforestation and countries with planned land clearing, to evaluate the effects government controlled planning has on the end result of human transformed landscapes in tropical and subtropical forest regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymer production from synthetic carbonaceous wastewater using glycogen accumulating organisms</field><field name="creator">Dai, Yu</field><field name="description">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are polyesters produced and stored intracellularly as reserve materials for carbon and energy by a wide range of prokaryotic microorganisms under imbalanced nutritional conditions. PHA production by pure culture has been extensively studied, enabling high production yields and a variety of polymer characteristics. Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-co-3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) (PHBV) has been commercially available under the trade name Biopol. However, the high production costs of these biopolymers are a major barrier for their widespread acceptance as substitute for traditional non-biodegradable polymers. The main costs are associated with maintaining the sterile conditions required by pure cultures, the use of expensive feed materials (eg. sugars) and also the polymer extraction process. Producing PHAs using mixed cultures (such as activated sludge) can drastically simplify the production process and significantly reduce the feed costs due to the use of cheap substrates. It also has the additional benefits in reusing waste materials. To date, substantial efforts have been put into improving PHA productivity in mixed cultures, with the characteristics of these bio-polyesters largely unexplored. The main product is typically PHB, which has several inherent deficiencies in properties. These include brittleness due to its high crystallinity, and thermal instability near its melting point of 175-180&amp;degC. To overcome the drawbacks of PHB, non-3HB monomer units are incorporated in the bio-polymerisation process, but this generally requires the addition of specific and often complex precursor substrates. Glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) are emerging as an attractive alternative to other heterotrophic PHA producers due to their special metabolism. GAOs were initially identified as competitors to the polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in alternating anaerobic/aerobic wastewater treatment systems. Under anaerobic conditions, GAOs generate energy and reducing power from glycogen hydrolysis, which are used for taking up carbon sources (eg. acetate or propionate) and their synthesis into PHAs as intracellular storage products. Under aerobic conditions, the stored PHAs is partly oxidised for energy generation with the remainder used for biomass growth and glycogen replenishment. The anaerobic hydrolysis of glycogen yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA which can be condensed to form 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-hydroxyvaleryl-CoA, the precursors of 3HB and 3HV. Therefore GAOs are capable of producing multiple 3- hydroxyalkanoate (3HA) monomers even when only a single carbon source (eg., acetate) is supplied. The potential of producing copolymers without addition of particular monomer-relevant carbon sources provides GAOs an advantage over other mixed culture heterotrophs in terms of polymer quality. So far, two main bacterial species have been identified to display the GAO phenotype, namely, Candidatus Competibacter phosphatis (henceforth referred to as Competibacter) and Defluviicoccus vanus-related GAOs belonging to the Alphaproteobacteria phylum (henceforth referred to as DvGAOs). This thesis focuses on the PHA production by GAOs. The capability of GAOs to produce heterogeneous PHAs from a single carbon source is investigated by characterising the PHA products and optimising the polymer productivity. Moreover, DvGAOs are comprehensively studied for their ability to yield novel four-monomer copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3-hydroxy-2-methylvalerate (3HMV) and 3-hydroxy-3- methylbutyrate (3HMB) with controllable composition and favourable physical properties. The main contributions from this thesis are summarised below. The polymers consisting of 3HB, 3HV and minor amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB, produced by Competibacter-dominated GAOs using acetate as a sole carbon source, were identified to be true copolymers based on a detailed characterisation using &amp;sup1H and &#185;&amp;sup3C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The monomer sequence distribution analysis using a known polymer characterisation model suggests that these polyesters are mixtures of random copolymers and thus likely possess desirable properties for practical use, which was confirmed experimentally. This demonstrates that GAOs have a true potential for producing high-quality polymers from a simple and cheap carbon source. The PHAs produced by GAOs under anaerobic and aerobic conditions were characterized using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The acetate-derived copolymers possessed characteristics similar to those of commercially available PHBV products. The anaerobically produced PHA contained a relatively constant proportion of non-3HB monomers (30&#177;5 C-mol%), irrespective of the amount of acetate assimilated. In contrast, under aerobic conditions, GAOs only produced 3HB monomers from acetate causing a gradually decreasing 3HV fraction. The 3HV fraction thus obtained ranged from 7 to 35 C-mol%, depending on the amount of acetate supplied under aerobic conditions. The PHAs produced under solely anaerobic conditions featured lower melting points and crystallinity, higher molecular weights, and narrower molecular weight distributions compared to the aerobically produced polymers. However, the anaerobic production yield was limited at 28% of dry cell weight (DCW) due to the shortage of glycogen, while aerobic production obtained a maximum polymer content of 41% based on DCW. To increase the PHA yield from anaerobic production, a novel three-stage strategy was developed. It was demonstrated to be an effective approach to optimise both the quantity and quality of the copolymers produced by GAOs. Using the Competibacterdominated GAO culture, up to 48 wt% poly(3HB-co-3HV-co-3HMV) based on DCW was achieved from acetate as the sole carbon source, close to the highest copolymer yield reported to date produced by mixed cultures but using specific precursor substrates. The optimisation method comprised of an aerobic famine, an aerobic feast, and an anaerobic feast period. The glycogen storage was enhanced through the initial two aerobic periods and hence increased the energy and reducing power available for the final anaerobic polymer synthesis step. The terpolymers/copolymers thus produced displayed high molecular weights (380-460 kg/mol) with a narrow distribution range. A feeding strategy based on pH-stat was demonstrated to achieve the automatic control of feed addition. Using a highly enriched DvGAO mixed culture (95&#177;3%) copolymers of 3HB, 3HV, 3HMV and 3HMB with controllable monomer fractions were obtained from acetate and propionate substrates. Through manipulating the ratio of acetate and propionate in the medium, the 3HB and 3HMV monomer portions could be varied extensively (10 to 66 mol% 3HB and 2 to 41 mol% 3HMV). The microstructure study revealed that the PHAs produced were likely random copolymers or mixtures of random copolymers. These PHA products were demonstrated to possess favourable properties. The weight-average molecular weights were in the range 390-560 kg/mol, while the DSC traces showed melting temperatures in the range of 70 to 161 &amp;degC, glass transition temperatures between -8 and 0 &amp;degC, and melting enthalpies (&#916;Hm) between 9.1 and 31.5 J/g. The incorporation of considerable amounts of 3HMV and 3HMB constituents greatly lowered the crystallinity, potentially providing the ductile and tough materials required for many practical applications. The anaerobic metabolism of DvGAOs with acetate and propionate was found to be well described by the metabolic models previously proposed for GAOs and verified with experimental data obtained with other types of GAO cultures. The results suggested DvGAOs likely use metabolic pathways similar to those used by other GAOs for anaerobic acetate and propionate uptake. However, when both acetate and propionate were present simultaneously, DvGAOs took up these two carbon sources sequentially, with propionate uptake preceding acetate uptake. As a result, mixtures of 3HV&amp;3HMV-rich copolymers and 3HB&amp;3HV-rich copolymers were formed. Through model-based analysis, it was hypothesised that DvGAOs prefer propionate in order to maximise their production of PHAs with the same glycogen consumption, which would enhance their growth potential in the following aerobic period. This feature may explain the more efficient PHA production by DvGAOs with propionate as the carbon substrate compared to acetate. Despite very low acetate consumption when propionate was available in excess, the presence of acetate considerably stimulated the uptake of propionate in comparison to the case where only propionate was present. This was likely due to the difference of the intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level in the two cases. A lower intracellular ATP level detected in the simultaneous presence of acetate and propionate might stimulate the glycolysis process resulting in a higher propionate uptake rate. This thesis shows that GAOs have indeed a good potential as cost-effective PHA producers. They are able to efficiently generate true copolymers of up to four 3HA monomers with desirable properties from simple carbon sources. Through manipulating the feed composition, comonomer fractions can vary in a wide range resulting in a variety of polymer properties. The contribution from this work could be very useful for the current drive to cost-effectively produce good quality PHAs to replace conventional petrol-derived polymers.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">279900 Other Biological Sciences</field><field name="subject">779999 Other</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microbial ecology of equine laminitis of alimentary origin</field><field name="creator">Milinovich, Gabriel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equine, laminitis, hindgut, microbiology, microbial ecology, Streptococcus, oligofructose.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge exposed to external carbon sources</field><field name="creator">Ginige, Maneesha Prasaad</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to identify the denitrifying microbial communities in activated sludge from full-scale treatment plants and from small-scale reactors exposed to acetate or methanol as external carbon sources. Biological denitrification is currently the most widely used, sustainable and cost-effective process to remove nitrogen from wastewater. Increasingly strict effluent discharge standards are posing significant challenges to plant operators to reduce effluent NO3--N concentrations to levels as low as 2-3 mg L-1 or even lower. The lack of sufficient influent carbon in many municipal wastewater treatment plants makes it very difficult to achieve such low NO3--N concentrations in the effluent. An effective solution to the problem is to introduce additional external carbon sources to enhance denitrification. The selection of external carbon sources is not purely based on costs but is also dependent on the possible microbial transformations that these carbon sources may bring about in activated sludge. The most common carbon source used is methanol due to its low cost, but it has been found to cause long delays until an improvement in denitrification performance is observed. On the other hand, acetate has been found to improve denitrification almost instantaneously when added, but it has a significantly higher cost. In this study, methanol and acetate utilising denitrifiers were investigated in activated sludge with and without enrichment in laboratory scale bioreactors. The relevant denitrifiers were identified and evaluated in situ using culture independent methods particularly stable isotope probing (SIP), 16S rDNA cloning, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and microautoradiography (MAR). Activated sludge collected from a biological nutrient removal plant exhibiting good denitrification was enriched in an anoxically-operated sequencing batch reactor (SBR) by feeding methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron acceptor. The SBR was operated over a duration of 7 months and the SBR denitrification rate improved from 0.02 mg NO3--N mg mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS)-1 h-1 to a steady-state value of 0.06 mg NO3-N mg MLVSS-1 h-1. At steady state operation the enriched biomass was subjected to SIP with 13C-methanol to biomark the denitrifiers capable of utilising methanol under anoxic conditions. The separated 12C-DNA and 13C-DNA fractions from the SIP experiment were individually subjected to full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotype (Group-A clones) in the 13C-library was closely related to the obligate methylotrophs Methylobacillus and Methylophilus in the order Methylophilales of the Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities), while the most abundant clone groups in the 12C-library mostly belonged to the family Saprospiraceae in the Bacteroidetes phylum. Oligonucleotide probes were designed for FISH to target the Group-A clones and Methylophilales (probes DEN67 and MET1216, respectively) and the Saprospiraceae clones (probe SAP553). Application of these probes on SBR biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of SBR denitrification and relative abundance of DEN67-targeted bacteria in the SBR community. By contrast, no correlation was found between denitrification rate and the relative abundances of the well known denitrifying genera Hyphomicrobium and Paracoccus nor the Saprospiraceae-clones visualised by FISH in the SBR biomass. FISH combined with microautoradiography independently confirmed that the DEN67-targeted cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of anoxic [14C] methanol uptake in the enriched biomass. As observed in full-scale operations, the methanol-fed SBR experienced a lag period of several weeks before denitrification performance increased. Using FISH quantification, it was shown that this coincided with the lag phase in the growth of the DEN67-targeted denitrifying population. It was therefore concluded that the Methylophilales bacteria dominant in our SBR system are likely to be important in full-scale methanol-fed denitrifying sludges. The acetate utilising microbial consortium in activated sludge was investigated without prior enrichment using stable isotope probing (SIP). 13C-acetate was used in SIP to biomark the DNA of the denitrifiers. The extracted 13C-DNA fraction was subjected to a full cycle rRNA analysis. The dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the 13C-library were closely related to bacterial families Comamonadaceae and Rhodocyclaceae of class Betaproteobacteria (96-97% sequence identities). Seven oligonucleotide probes (DEN444, DEN220, DEN581, DEN441, DEN124, DEN220a and DEN1454) for use in FISH was designed to specifically target the identified phylotypes. Application of these probes on the sludge of a continuously fed denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (CFDSBR) operated over a duration of 16 days indicated a strong correlation between the level of CFDSBR denitrification and relative abundance of all probe-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community. FISH combined with microautoradiography (FISH-MAR) further confirmed that the DEN581- and DEN124-targeted cells dominating the CFDSBR were capable of taking up [14C] acetate under anoxic conditions. The initial occurrence of the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria and the final dominance of DEN581- and DEN124-targeted bacteria in the CFDSBR community were likely related to the changing in-reactor nitrite concentrations during the first few days of CFDSBR operation. Hence, the DEN444- and DEN1454-targeted bacteria were hypothesised to have low affinities for nitrite while DEN124- and DEN581-targeted bacteria have higher nitrite affinities. However, it was clear that all probe-targeted bacteria were denitrifiers capable of utilising acetate as a carbon source. The rapid increase in numbers of the probe-targeted organisms positively correlates with the immediate increase in denitrification rates. The rapid response and community shifts observed when acetate was used to enhance denitrification suggest that an intermittent application of acetate is quite effective to temporarily enhance the denitrification capacity of a treatment plant. However, the importance of a bacterial impact assessment of activated sludge subjected to intermittent acetate supplementation is recommended prior to the wide use of acetate in the wastewater industry. The acetate utilising denitrifying microbial communities investigated in the previous chapter were characterised according to their eco-physiological properties using the r- and K-selection criteria. The electron donor (acetate) and acceptor (nitrite) affinities of these probe-identified denitrifiers were used as traits for this characterisation. The substrate to microorganism (S/M) ratio was manipulated to provide high and low substrate concentrations in the reactor to create conditions favourable for r- and K-strategists, respectively. Two factors, namely feeding regimes and sludge retention times, were studied to achieve the desired S/M ratios and enable r/K characterisation. The high substrate affinities and high specific growth rates of two probe-identified denitrifiers (DEN124 and DEN581) did not enable resolution of these two organisms with the feeding regimes used in this study. However, the application of different sludge retention times as a control strategy to maintain constant high and low in-reactor S/M ratios enabled characterisation of the two probe-targeted denitrifiers DEN124 and DEN581 as K- and r-strategists, respectively. The in-reactor S/M ratios applied in this study did not facilitate the characterisation of populations targeted by probes DEN444 and DEN1454. The minor fluctuations of the S/M ratios during a cycle in the SBR operation was considered as a drawback, but conclusive results could still be obtained from the study. A chemostat reactor operation with constant loading and variable flow rates is suggested as an alternative. Conclusively, this study was able to identify specific groups of denitrifying microorganisms in activated sludge when exposed to acetate and methanol. Unlike most previous studies, which relied on culture dependent methods, this study adopted a pure culture independent approach to identify microorganisms in relation to their function, i.e. denitrification. Moreover, acetate denitrifiers were in situ characterised based on eco-physiological properties. The identification of denitrifying communities in this study has paved the way to a larger research project on the optimisation of denitrification processes with external acetate, methanol and other carbon supplements. As such, this study has contributed significantly to the understanding of the denitrification processes by linking process data with microbial investigations.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">770502 Land and water management</field><field name="subject">290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="subject">670700 Industrial Chemicals and Related Products</field><field name="subject">Wastewater treatment</field><field name="subject">Activated sludge</field><field name="subject">Nitrogen removal</field><field name="subject">External carbon</field><field name="subject">FISH</field><field name="subject">MAR</field><field name="subject">Denitrification</field><field name="subject">Bacteria</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Microorganisms</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Origins and Evolution of the North-Eastern and Central Polabian (Wendish) Religious and Political System</field><field name="creator">Zaroff, Roman</field><field name="description">The term Polabian Slavs is a generic name applied to the westernmost branch of the Western Slavs, now almost extinct. Those people are often referred to as Wends, but mainly in older historiography. In the Middle Ages they occupied the territory more or less corresponding to the former state of East Germany, the region enclosed by the Baltic Sea in the North, the Oder-Neisse rivers in the East, the Ore mountains in the South and the Elbe-Saale rivers in the West (see map 1). In Central Europe, with the exception of the Baltic Prussians and Lithuanians, some of the Polabian Slavs resisted Christianisation and remained stubbornly pagan until the middle of the twelfth century. In the course of history the Polabian Slavs came under increasing political pressure from the Franks and later from the Empire, in the period between the eighth and the twelfth centuries. From the north they were also hard pressed by the Danes and in some periods from the east by the growing strength in Poland of the Piast dynasty. By the end of the twelfth century most of the Polabian Slavs fell under German or Danish political control. Some of them in the central region, what is now the Land of Brandenburg, and the tribes in the South were fully incorporated into the Empire. Others, like the Obodrites and some of the Veleti in Western Pomerania, became part of the Empire as autonomous duchies ruled by the local princes, while the island of R&#252;gen and the adjacent mainland territories, although they continued to be ruled by the Slavic dynasts, had to acknowledge Danish suzerainty. The whole territory, despite some areas being under the Danish crown, became subject to strong German political and cultural influence. Assimilation and German colonization facilitated the process of the Germanization of almost the entire area between the Saale-Elbe and Oder-Neisse rivers. Over the centuries the Polabian Slavs have almost entirely disappeared as a distinct people. However, the process is not fully completed even today, for a small Sorb minority still retains its distinct cultural identity. The modern Sorbs, numbering around 100,000 people are living today in eastern Germany in the region of Lusatia (Lausitz in German or &#163;u&#158;ica in Sorbian), mainly around Bautzen and Cottbus. Approximately 60,000 of them still speak a Slavonic language. Although this work does not deal directly with the Sorbs of Lusatia, it is dedicated to those surviving Polabian Slavs. [No abstract available - text taken from Introduction]</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">430108 History - European</field><field name="subject">Medieval</field><field name="subject">Slavs</field><field name="subject">Western Slavs</field><field name="subject">Slavic</field><field name="subject">Slavonic</field><field name="subject">Polabian</field><field name="subject">Religion</field><field name="subject">Paganism</field><field name="subject">Sventovit</field><field name="subject">Theocracy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leading conservatoria through change. New challenges for music institutions and their leaders, 1985-2005</field><field name="creator">Lancaster, Helen May</field><field name="description">Conservatoria in the past provided prospective musicians with training in performance, generally in the classical Western European tradition. Most of them were independent of universities, free from academic constraints, focused on performance, flexible in their practice, and desirous of (yet susceptible to) high profile individual leadership. The last two decades in particular have generated significant change, placing conservatoria under increasing pressure from new challenges. Now confronting those shifting boundaries which have reshaped the artistic climate and organisational environment, many are also compelled to broaden access whilst meeting the challenge of reduced government subsidy. New higher education policies and declining resources have caused the relocation of many conservatoria into the university sector, most particularly (but not exclusively) in Australia and the USA. This development has resulted in new systems of governance and different expectations of both the conservatorium and its leaders. Thus government policy impacts on the potential shape of the conservatorium. Changing funding structures in higher education and the arts further complicate the influence government policy might have on conservatoria. For autonomous conservatoria, government arts and education policies directly effect institutional policy and financial stability. Where conservatoria exist within universities, a domino effect devolves the impact of higher education policy to internal units like the conservatorium. Compounding these circumstances is the reality that traditional performance is diminishing in social relevance and the professions into which future music graduates will move are now more diverse than ever before and clearly less dependent solely on conventional music training. Consequently contemporary conservatorium leaders now confront a different, less compliant musical environment. Decisions made by these leaders have the potential to impact well beyond conservatorium walls. Therefore, for those conservatoria which have evolved as part of the cultural infrastructure of their respective communities, internal conservatorium choices may obscure the broader ramifications these choices have for the wider community. From inside the university sector, some conservatoria are challenged to give priority to the needs of the university community, with resultant effects on their individual conservatorium characters. The time-honoured preference for conservatorium leaders to be renowned musicians does not necessarily meet all of the contemporary criteria relevant to the role. Traditionally, leaders in conservatoria were selected for their artistic profile, ostensibly to enhance that of the institution. As spokespersons and figureheads of their institutions, leaders once made more artistic considerations and connections than strategic decisions. Whereas in years past they may have maintained high profile roles as conductors, performers, composers, or musicologists, now leaders are expected to provide varying degrees of artistic direction, academic leadership, curriculum design, administration, financial management, facilities management, event production, marketing, public relations, and community liaison. These diverse roles make an external career unrealistic for most. This dissertation examines the challenges confronting conservatoria as they appear through the eyes of conservatorium leaders around the world. By analysing the leaders&#146; comments in parallel with surveys, case examples, and documentary research, I aim to develop an understanding of the impact these challenges have on conservatoria and those who lead them. Through continual reporting of the emerging results back to the field during the period of the research, I build on their credibility, shedding light on those policies which both shape the conservatorium condition and elicit resilience among some who lead them. The thesis argues that each conservatorium is distinctive, and that the challenges confronting a conservatorium must be viewed in the light of its specific, often unique context. Among conservatoria, uniqueness emerges from the common ground that all such institutions share: within the context of conservatorium family resemblances, it may be that one conservatorium has a mix of quite distinctive attributes or conditions. It is that idiosyncratic set of circumstances shaping each institutional environment which generates this uniqueness, making generalisations problematical and inappropriate to the conservatorium condition. Each context is further complicated by constant change which is both evolutionary and imposed. For these reasons, there is no single profile fitting a conservatorium leader. Rather, leadership style needs to align to shifting circumstances, which implies that conservatorium leaders need to understand how to adjust their approach to leadership as the individual setting evolves. The argument is consistent with the findings that purposive preparation is crucial for leaders of contemporary conservatoria, to give them the diversity of skills required for the role and the flexibility necessary to adapt to changing circumstances. Because a conservatorium has the potential to be part of the cultural infrastructure of the community in which it resides, these conditions carry implications which extend beyond the conservatorium and have the capacity to impact on future generations. The conservatorium culture implies natural intersections with the community through the provision of performance and teaching services. Conservatorium facilities in their turn become part of the repertoire of community performance and recording resources. The extent to which this relationship might develop relies on each conservatorium&#146;s perception of its place within its own community, and each leader&#146;s interpretation of this positioning. A leader who places emphasis on external relationships might embed the institution within the community, socially and culturally. This combined understanding of the institution&#146;s role within the community is a significant factor in the realisation of each conservatorium&#146;s individual potential.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acquisition of word order in Chinese as a foreign language: An error taxonomy</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Wenying Wendy</field><field name="description">Research in the field of Chinese second/foreign language (L2) acquisition, at present, does not match the increasing demand to learn Chinese as an L2, given that Chinese is the fastest growing foreign language (FL) in countries such as Japan, South Korea, the United States, Canada and Australia. There is a significant gap between Chinese L2 acquisition research and the large body of literature in second language acquisition (SLA), which mainly focuses on English L2. The need for more research in Chinese SLA is compelling. Particularly, research in Chinese L2 word order acquisition requires more attention because word order plays a more complex role in Chinese than in English. Chinese relies heavily on word order for information structuring of a sentence because this language lacks other means, such as verb endings indicating tense and aspect, to accomplish this function. Due to the different roles word order plays in Chinese and English, adult English-speaking learners find Chinese word order acquisition very challenging. Chinese L2 word order errors frequently occur in learners&#146; L2 production. However, Chinese L2 researchers and teachers are left with no means to adequately describe and explain these errors for instruction purposes. This dissertation develops such a means &#151; a comprehensive taxonomy of Chinese L2 word order errors. This taxonomy organizes these errors into a logical system of classification. Through the classification, explicit description of various Chinese L2 word order errors is achieved, and specific sources of these errors are traced. Data was collected from 116 native-English-speaking learners of Chinese at a large university in Australia. The Chinese L2 learners were divided into three proficiency levels based on their institutional status. Four hundred and eight word order errors were extracted by qualitatively analyzing the learners&#146; written samples. Among the 408 word order errors, 404 (99%) are successfully classified into different categories according to a new criterion proposed in this dissertation. The new taxonomy provides a principle-based description and explanation of various Chinese L2 word order errors. A word order error is deemed to constitute an error when it violates a relevant word order principle (or sub-principle). These principles not only explain why an error is an error but also provide a means for correcting the error. In a pedagogical sense, the directness and explicitness in explaining word order errors achieved by employing this taxonomy cannot be achieved by relying on any other sources of errors available in the literature. The new taxonomy overcomes the limitations of existing taxonomies in the literature that are either superficial, or unsystematic, or not empirically testable. For example, it draws on the Cognitive Functionalist Approach of L2 acquisition. Both its description and explanation of Chinese L2 word errors go beyond superficiality. The approach maintains that adult L2 learners&#146; conceptualization of the world is initially based on their L1. Their conceptualization of the world imposes constraints on the linguistic structures of their L2. Therefore, errors may occur when English learners of Chinese impose their conceptualization based on the English language onto the Chinese structures. The new taxonomy is systematic because it categorizes word order errors using one criterion. New categories emerging from the data and the existing categories from the literature are incorporated into one system. Finally, the new taxonomy is empirically testable because many new categories emerged from the data. It is an open-ended rather than a closed system. New categories can be added as necessary. The dissertation finds that violation of relevant word order principles has a high explanatory value for the various word order errors encountered in the data. This has clear pedagogical implications. Chinese L2 learners generally lack awareness of the word order principles (and sub-principles) on which the new taxonomy is based. These principles and sub-principles are seen to be of considerable importance to the acquisition of Chinese L2 word order. In order to improve learners&#146; word order performance, the results of this study indicate that it is imperative for the basic Chinese word order principles be included in a CFL curriculum.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">380201 Applied Linguistics and Educational Linguistics</field><field name="subject">751000 Communication</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vaccine-adjuvant-carrier design against group A streptococcus and human papillomavirus type-16 infection</field><field name="creator">Moyle, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions, with a plethora of vaccines marketed for disease prevention. Most vaccines require parenteral administration, potentially reducing patient compliance due to injection associated pain, as well as requiring administration by trained medical staff. The capacity to deliver vaccines via a mucosal route (e.g. via the nose or mouth) has therefore been subject to a large amount of research. Despite this interest, few mucosal vaccine candidates have successfully progressed to human clinical trials. The attachment of synthetic or bacterial lipids to peptide antigens has been shown to effectively increase the immune response to poorly immunogenic peptide antigens administered via parenteral or mucosal routes. Human clinical trials of lipopeptide vaccines suggest that they in general have a good safety profile, with few or no side effects reported. The lipid core peptide (LCP) system is a lipopeptide vaccine delivery system that incorporates a lipidic adjuvant, carrier, and peptide epitopes into a single molecular entity. The LCPsystem has been demonstrated to adjuvant peptide epitopes from several group A streptococcal (GAS) strains. Antibodies elicited following immunisation with these LCPsystems may potentially protect against challenge with homologous GAS strains. Despite this encouraging data, the LCP-system suffers the inability to be thoroughly characterised, or purified to homogeneity, thus limiting its capacity to be examined in human clinical trials. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop a human-compatible mucosal LCP-based GAS vaccine. The aim of this research was therefore to develop methods for the synthesis of readily characterisable, highly pure LCP-analogues, in decent yield. Techniques that were examined, both in solution and on a solid support, included native chemical ligation and fragment condensation. Both of these techniques suffered from solubility problems. For native chemical ligation, the addition of organic solvents to the ligation mixture helped solubilise species containing the LCP lipid adjuvant, although successful ligation was not observed. The addition of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the ligation mixture however was capable of solubilising lipidic species and enabled successful ligation. The thesis describes the use of this technique for the synthesis of two tri-epitopic GAS LCP-analogues, and a monoepitopic, tetra-valent GAS LCP-system, with the two tri-epitopic LCP-analogues assessed for their capacity to elicit systemic antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Overall, the thesis describes the development of a successful technique for synthesising highly pure, multi-epitopic lipopeptide vaccines for possible use in human clinical trials. In addition, the developed technique should be applicable for the synthesis of lipopeptide vaccines targeting other microorganisms, particularly where a multi-epitopic vaccine approach is warranted. While many studies have examined the LCP-systems capacity to elicit antigen-specific antibodies against attached peptide epitopes, few studies have examined its ability to elicit antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). The ability to elicit antigen-specific CTL responses is important for the development of therapeutic vaccines against viral infections and cancer. Described is the synthesis of a series of LCP-systems incorporating a human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) peptide antigen [HPV-16 E7(44-62)], containing a CTL, Bcell, and T-helper epitope. The vaccines were synthesised in order to investigate their capability to be used for the prevention and/or treatment of HPV-16 associated cervical cancer. Four mannose residues, both in O-acetylated and de-O-acetylated form, were attached to the vaccines to investigate the effect of potential dendritic cell mannose receptor targeting. The vaccines were assessed using a murine HPV-16 tumour model (TC-1 cells). This model demonstrated the capacity of the HPV-16 LCP-systems to reduce or eradicate TC-1 tumours when administered prior to tumour challenge (prophylactic), with mannose containing vaccines exhibiting greater efficacy. Overall, this study suggested that HPV-16 E7(44-62) LCP-systems had the capacity to elicit antigen-specific CTLs capable of clearing HPV-16 associated tumours when administered prior to tumour development. Based on this data, further research should be conducted to examine whether these vaccines are capable of eliminating or reducing the size of developed tumours, why mannose conjugation improved vaccine efficacy, and whether this was due to mannose receptor targeting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planctomycete diversity and cell biology: perspectives from the molecular, cellular and organism levels</field><field name="creator">Butler, Margaret Kay</field><field name="description">The Planctomycetes are a deep branching phylum of the domain Bacteria that incorporate a diverse group of organisms possessing a number of unusual and distinct characteristics. These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A macroscopic chemistry method for the direct simulation of non-equilibrium gas flows</field><field name="creator">Lilley, Charles Ranald</field><field name="description">The macroscopic chemistry method for modelling non-equilibrium reacting gas flows with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is developed and tested. In the macroscopic method, the calculation of chemical reactions is decoupled from the DSMC collision routine. The number of reaction events that must be performed in a cell is calculated with macroscopic rate expressions. These expressions use local macroscopic information such as kinetic temperatures and density. The macroscopic method is applied to a symmetrical diatomic gas. For each dissociation event, a single diatom is selected with a probability based on internal energy and is dissociated into two atoms. For each recombination event, two atoms are selected at random and replaced by a single diatom. To account for the dissociation energy, the thermal energies of all particles in the cell are adjusted. The macroscopic method differs from conventional collision-based DSMC chemistry procedures, where reactions are performed as an integral part of the collision routine. The most important advantage offered by the macroscopic method is that it can utilise reaction rates that are any function of the macroscopic flow conditions. It therefore allows DSMC chemistry calculations to be performed using rate expressions for which no conventional chemistry model may exist. Given the accuracy and flexibility of the macroscopic method, it has significant potential for modelling reacting non-equilibrium gas flows. The macroscopic method is tested by performing DSMC calculations and comparing the results to those obtained using conventional DSMC chemistry models and experimental data. The macroscopic method gives density profiles in good agreement with experimental data in the chemical relaxation region downstream of a strong shock. Within the shock where strongly non-equilibrium conditions prevail, the macroscopic method provides good agreement with a conventional chemistry model. For the flow over a blunt axisymmetric cylinder, which also exhibits strongly non-equilibrium conditions, the macroscopic method also gives reasonable agreement with conventional chemistry models. The ability of the macroscopic method to utilise any rate expression is demonstrated by using a two-temperature rate model that accounts for dissociation-vibration coupling effects that are important in non-equilibrium reacting flows. Relative to the case without dissociation-vibration coupling, the macroscopic method with the two-temperature model gives reduced dissociation rates in vibrationally cold flows, as expected. Also, for the blunt cylinder flow, the two-temperature model gives reduced surface heat fluxes, as expected. The macroscopic method is also tested with a number density dependent form of the equilibrium constant. For zero-dimensional chemical relaxation, the resulting relaxation histories are in good agreement with those provided by an exact Runge-Kutta solution of the relaxation behaviour. Reviews of basic DSMC procedures and conventional DSMC chemistry models are also given. A method for obtaining the variable hard sphere parameters for collisions between particles of different species is given. Borgnakke-Larsen schemes for modelling internal energy exchange are examined in detail. Both continuous rotational and quantised vibrational energy modes are considered. Detailed derivations of viscosity and collision rate expressions for the generalised hard sphere model of Hassan and Hash [Phys. Fluids 5, 738 (1993)] and the modified version of Macrossan and Lilley [J. Thermophys.

Then the pair (T1, T2) where T1 = L \M and T2 = M \ L is called a latin bitrade. Furthermore T1 and T2 are referred to as latin trades, in which T2 is said to be a disjoint mate of T1 (and vice versa). Dr&#225;pal (1991) showed that, under certain conditions, a partition of an equilateral triangle of side length n, where n is some integer, into smaller, integer length sided equilateral triangles gives rise to a latin trade within the latin square based on the addition table for the integers modulo n. A partial latin square P of order n is said to be completable if there exists a latin square L of order n such that P &#8838; L. If there is only one such possible latin square, L, of order n then P is said to be uniquely completable and P is called a defining set of L. Furthermore, if C is a uniquely completable partial latin square such that no proper subset of C is uniquely completable, C is said to be a critical set or a minimal defining set. These concepts, namely latin trades and defining sets in latin squares, are intimately connected by the following observation. If L is a latin square and D &#8838; L is a defining set, then D intersects all latin bitrades for which one mate is contained in L. In Part I of this thesis Dr&#180;apal&#8217;s result is applied to investigate the structure of certain defining sets in latin squares. The results that are obtained are interesting in themselves; furthermore, the geometric approach to the problem yields additional appealing results. These geometric results are discussed in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6. They pertain to partitioning regions (polygons in R2 that satisfy certain obvious conditions) into equilateral, integer length sided, triangles, such that no point, in the region, is a corner of more than three distinct triangles. In Chapter 2 one of the main two theorems on defining sets is established, as is a method for using the above geometric results to prove the nonexistence of certain types of defining sets. In Part II of this thesis, intersection problems, for latin squares and Steiner triple systems, are considered. The seminal works, for problems of these types, are due to Lindner and Rosa (1975) and Fu (1980). A natural progression, from the established literature, for intersection problems between elements in a pair of latin squares or Steiner triple systems is to problems in which the intersection is composed of a number of disjoint configurations (isomorphic copies of some specified partial triple system). In this thesis solutions to two intersection problems for disjoint configurations are detailed. An m-flower, (F,F), is a partial triple system/configuration, such that: F = {{x, yi, zi} | {yi, zi} &#8745; {yj , zj} = &#8709;, for 0 &#8804; i, j &#8804; m &#8722; 1, i 6= j}; and F = UX&#8712;FX. The first such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k and m &#8805; 2 such that a pair of latin squares of order n exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint m-flowers. The necessary terminology, constructions, lemmas and proof for this result are contained in Chapters 7, 8 and 9. The second such problem considered in this thesis asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for integers k such that a pair of Steiner triple systems of order u exists that intersect precisely in k disjoint 2-flowers. This result relies on the solution to the latin square problem and an additional result from Chapter 9. The further constructions and lemmas used to prove this result are detailed in Chapter 10.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">01 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="subject">latin square</field><field name="subject">latin trade</field><field name="subject">latin bitrade</field><field name="subject">triangulation</field><field name="subject">defining set</field><field name="subject">critical set</field><field name="subject">partial triple system</field><field name="subject">Steiner triple system</field><field name="subject">intersection problem</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:202172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Continuum diffusion on networks</field><field name="creator">Christophe Haynes</field><field name="description">In this thesis we develop and use a continuum random walk framework to solve problems that are usually studied using a discrete random walk on a discrete lattice. Problems studied include; the time it takes for a random walker to be absorbed at a trap on a fractal lattice, the calculation of the spectral dimension for several different classes of networks, the calculation of the density of states for a multi-layered Bethe lattice and the relationship between diffusion exponents and a resistivity exponent that occur in relevant power laws. The majority of the results are obtained by deriving an expression for a Laplace transformed Green&#8217;s function or first passage time, and then using Tauberian theorems to find the relevant asymptotic behaviour. The continuum framework is established by studying the diffusion equation on a 1-d bar with non-homogeneous boundary conditions. The result is extended to model diffusion on networks through linear algebra. We derive the transformation linking the Green&#8217;s functions and first passage time results in the continuum and discrete settings. The continuum method is used in conjunction with renormalization techniques to calculate the time taken for a random walker to be absorbed at a trap on a fractal lattice and also to find the spectral dimension of new classes of networks. Although these networks can be embedded in the d- dimensional Euclidean plane, they do not have a spectral dimension equal to twice the ratio of the fractal dimension and the random walk dimension when the random walk on the network is transient. The networks therefore violate the Alexander-Orbach law. The fractal Einstein relationship (a relationship relating a diffusion exponent to a resistivity exponent) also does not hold on these networks. Through a suitable scaling argument, we derive a generalised fractal Einstein relationship which holds for our lattices and explains anomalous results concerning transport on diffusion limited aggregates and Eden trees.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Random walk</field><field name="subject">Spectral dimension</field><field name="subject">First passage times</field><field name="subject">Continuum</field><field name="subject">Renormalization</field><field name="subject">Fractal Einstein</field><field name="subject">N- TD trees</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:205411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intergenerational Transference of Alcohol Problems: The Role of Parental and Offspring Cognitions</field><field name="creator">Justine Campbell</field><field name="description">In alcohol literature, various genetic and environmental theories have been proposed for the transfer of alcohol problems, however these have resulted in a number of unanswered questions regarding the extent that these factors influence the transmission of alcohol use behaviour. It is therefore suggested that specific cognitions related to alcohol use are fundamental in determining future alcohol use. Studies by Oei and colleagues (Baldwin, Oei, &amp; Young, 1993; Lee &amp; Oei, 1993; Oei &amp; Burrow, 2000; Oei, Fergusson, &amp; Lee, 1998) have investigated two cognitive constructs that together have shown to be predictive of the quantity and frequency of alcohol use; Alcohol Expectancies (AE) and Drinking Refusal Self-Efficacy (DRSE). Whereas a number of studies have shown that parental alcohol behaviour and attitudes can predict their offsprings&#8217;&#8217; alcohol use, no study to date has directly assessed parents&#8217; AE and DRSE with those of their children. The current thesis proposed a cognitive model for the Intergenerational Transference of Alcohol Use Behaviour (see Campbell &amp; Oei, 2010) suggesting that parental alcohol cognitions and behaviour will contribute to their offsprings&#8217; cognitions, in turn leading to their alcohol use. Study 1 (N = 1256) tested the cognitive model to determine its accuracy and the relationships it encompasses. The data was then split into younger (&lt;12 years) and older (&gt;12 years) child groups to determine if the model was consistent in offspring in differing maturational and cognitive stages of development and alcohol use. It was revealed that the overall data fit the model well. Different patterns were however revealed between the two groups suggesting that parental alcohol use behaviour was moderately associated with alcohol expectancies in their young children, whereas their AE and DRSE became more significant in the maintenance of their older offsprings&#8217; alcohol use. Study 2 (N=492) tested the model across parent/offspring gender dyads in an attempt to isolate the cognitive and behavioural aspects that are specific to gender in determining the intergenerational transference of alcohol use behaviour. Same and cross gender comparisons revealed that sons were influenced by paternal, but not maternal, alcohol cognitions, whereas no influence was exerted on daughters&#8217; cognitions or behaviour from either parent. Such findings suggest that males may be more prone to genetic influences whereas females may be more sensitive to disruptions in their home environment. As such, the role of Family Functioning was assessed in Study 3 (N =482) to determine whether this environmental factor contributes further to the overall cognitive model between sons and daughters. Results indicated that family environment was significantly related to parents higher AE and lower DRSE, but not their offsprings&#8217;. Separation of parent and child data revealed that sons, but not daughters, were influenced more by family functioning. However, upon further investigation results revealed that poor family environment had a greater impact on fathers than mothers, and that this impacted on sons but not daughters. It therefore seems plausible from these results that females (mothers and daughters) alcohol use is related to variables external to the family environment such as peers or media. The final study tested the cognitive model using longitudinal data to determine causal relationships in the transference of alcohol use behaviour. Findings suggest that the relationship between parent and offspring alcohol cognitions could explicitly predict children&#8217;s alcohol use behaviour. Specifically, the model revealed that parents&#8217; self-efficacy beliefs, but not their expectancies, was associated with children&#8217;s DRSE, and that children&#8217;s alcohol cognitions significantly predicted their alcohol consumption six months later. The study did reveal however that children&#8217;s alcohol expectancies may become less influential in the maintenance of alcohol consumption as they get older. Overall findings suggest that the cognitive model for the intergenerational transference of alcohol problems has advantages for prevention and treatment strategies, particularly given that that cognitions, and in turn behaviours are particularly modifiable to change. Theoretical implications also exist such that a testable model adds depth to the conceptualisation of the mechanisms for the transference of alcohol problems within families. Particularly, the opportunity arises to incorporate cognitive influences into the intergenerational literature, resulting in a more thorough Genotype x Environment x Cognitive theory.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alcohol</field><field name="subject">expectancies</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">Self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Intergenerational transference</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:214044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Microfluidic Platform to Enable Screening of Immobilised Biomolecule Mixtures</field><field name="creator">Michael Hines</field><field name="description">Abstract This thesis describes the design, fabrication and operation of a microfluidic device for the screening of biomolecule mixture surface mediated effects. The characterisation of a surface immobilisation strategy that will allow the robust attachment of candidate biomolecules on a substrate for use in cell culture applications. This is carried out in the form of a modified and optimised layer-by-layer surface immobilisation strategy and its subsequent thorough and robust characterisation. This was achieved by compiling and critically analysing large amounts of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) data and the model utilised to provide meaningful, physical data as an output. QCM-D data was combined with surface plasmon resonance (SPR) data to validate the assumptions used within the QCM-D model package. Further evidence demonstrating the presence of the multilayer, as described by QCM-D and SPR, is achieved using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). These results show that the multilayer surface is robustly attached to the substrate and consists of a large amount of water whilst being able to immobilise mixtures of four proteins. A custom protocol for fabricating these two layer devices was devised and is presented. Scale limitations have been overcome to provide mixing capabilities for large extracellular matrix molecules to be immobilised on the previously described, microfluidically generated surface immobilisation strategy. The optimisation and characterisation of the mixing within this microfluidic device, affected by the incorporated staggered herring bone mixer is also shown. Using dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) along with a custom designed force curve data processing and analysis package, the spatial localisation of a mixture of four immobilised biomolecules was determined. The aim of this study was to compare the spatial localization of a mixture of four biomolecules created by; standard cell culture protocols (adsorbed from bulk onto tissue culture polystyrene) and a surface created via microfluidic deposition on top of a previously described surface immobilisation strategy. The design and robust application of this custom analysis package allows the definition of a &#8220;Barricade of Specificity&#8221; such that interactions between an antibody functionalised AFM tip and a surface composed of a mixture of proteins, to be categorised as either a &#8220;true&#8221; specific interaction, or a non-specific interaction. The application of this Barricade of Specificity thus allows the spatial localisation of four immobilized biomolecules to be determined with a large degree of accuracy as a result of the large rage of non-specific interactions surveyed and the strict definition of a valid rupture force. The final chapter details the application of the microfluidic platform to enable high throughput screening of the effects of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, singly and in combination, with regards to the effect on the expression of cell surface markers on umbilical cord blood (UCB) derived CD34+ cells. Careful selection of candidate ECM molecules, cytokine and oxygen concentration has resulted in little difference in the effect on UCB derived CD34+ cells differentiation state after seven days in culture. The major effect has been the maturation towards lymphocyte and leukocyte precursors. However, of the four ECM molecules tested individually, in binary and in quaternary combinations, osteopontin (Opn) and laminin (Ln) demonstrated differences compared to other surfaces tested. In order to further assess the effect of these protein surfaces on the cell surface marker expression of UCB derived CD34+ cells, further tests are warranted for increased periods of time to enable greater discrimination in marker expression and thus increase our understanding of the fundamental biology of this rare and clinically useful cell source.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hematopoietic stem cells</field><field name="subject">multilayer photolithography</field><field name="subject">microfluidic mixing</field><field name="subject">staggered herringbone mixer</field><field name="subject">quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation</field><field name="subject">dynamic force spectroscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215361</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Generic resemblances?' : women and work in Queensland, 1919-1939</field><field name="creator">Scott, Joanne, 1965-</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">200205 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">750101 Employment</field><field name="subject">Women -- Employment -- Queensland -- History.</field><field name="subject">Women -- Queensland -- Economic conditions.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:215530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sheet Flow Sediment Transport and Swash Hydrodynamics</field><field name="creator">Paul Guard</field><field name="description">The unsteady nature of coastal hydrodynamics is associated with complex boundary layer dynamics and hence engineering predictions of shear stresses and sediment transport are difficult. This thesis explores some of the complex hydrodynamic problems and boundary layer behaviour in the coastal zone and seeks to provide new and improved modelling approaches. The latest experimental results are used to inform the model development process. New laboratory experiments carried out as part of this thesis illustrate the value of convolution integral calculations for both pressure and skin friction forces on particles on the bed. The experiments also highlight the importance of the phase differences between free stream velocity and boundary layer shear stresses. The use of a &#8220;bed&#8221; shear stress as a model input is found to be problematic whenever there is a large vertical gradient in the boundary layer shear stress. New experimental and modelling work has helped to improve our understanding of sheet flow boundary layer dynamics. This thesis builds on some of these new discoveries to propose a new simplified model framework for sheet flow sediment transport prediction using convolution integrals. This time domain technique has the advantage of simplicity while incorporating the most important physical processes from more detailed models. The new model framework could be incorporated into any depth averaged coastal hydrodynamic modelling software package. Boundary layer analysis techniques presented in the thesis provide an improved understanding of the effective roughness of mobile beds and can be used to calculate instantaneous shear stress profiles throughout the mobile bed boundary layer. New solutions for swash zone hydrodynamics are presented which illustrate the limitations of the previous benchmark analytical model for swash hydrodynamics. It is shown that real swash necessarily involves a much larger influx of mass and momentum than the analytical solution which was previously used by many in the swash sediment transport research community. Models for swash boundary layer development are also presented.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sheet flow</field><field name="subject">sediment transport</field><field name="subject">convolution integrals</field><field name="subject">bed shear stress</field><field name="subject">numerical modelling</field><field name="subject">swash</field><field name="subject">hydrodynamics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">YOUNG CHILDREN&#8217;S SOCIAL COMPETENCE: ITERATIONS BETWEEN THEORY AND MEASUREMENT</field><field name="creator">Sok Mui Lim</field><field name="description">Maintaining relationships and interacting socially are essential aspects of children&#8217;s occupational performance. Social participation occurs during many childhood occupations such as play and school work. Rather than assessing social skills deficits in isolation, occupational therapists are well placed to assess and treat children with difficulties in social participation during their daily childhood occupations. The existing models of social competence fail to consider or describe the social skills required during learning-related tasks. Therefore, a comprehensive model is needed to guide occupational therapists in understanding social competence during both interpersonal and learning-related social tasks and in specific contexts (e.g., early childhood settings) (Lim &amp; Rodger, 2008). Background and Research Aims: &#8220;Social participation&#8221; falls within the occupational therapy domain of concern according to the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework (2nd edition) (American Occupational Therapy Association [AOTA], 2008), However, surveys conducted in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada indicate that there has been limited provision of services for children with poor social skills compared to areas such as sensory processing, motor skill development and visual perceptual skills training (Brown, Rodger, Brown, &amp; Roever, 2005; Howard, 2002; Rodger, Brown, &amp; Brown, 2005). Factors such as a limited knowledge of available tools and limited access to social skills models have hampered occupational therapists&#8217; accurate assessment of social skills (Doble, Bonnell, &amp; Magill-Evans, 1991). This study was conducted in Singapore, where generally there has been limited occupational therapy research, and even less in specific early childhood and school environments. High levels of proficiency in pre-literacy and mathematic skills are expected of young Singaporean children (Ko, 1992; Tan, 2007). With the emphasis on gaining academic skills to be ready for primary education from as early as 3 to 4 years of age, Singaporean children are also expected to demonstrate compliance and ability to sit still while attending to a lesson (Tan, 2007). Hence, it is important to conduct research on specific cultural contexts such as early childhood environments in Singapore. The early childhood literature has begun to differentiate between interpersonal social skills (IPS) and learning-related social skills (LRSS). IPS is needed for maintaining friendships and engaging in play, while LRSS is required for positive classroom behaviours (e.g., staying on task) (McClelland &amp; Morrison, 2003). This research aimed to investigate the validity of the Proposed Model of Social Competence relevant to occupational therapists working with children in early childhood settings. First, this study aimed to investigate whether LRSS and IPS exist as separate unidimensional constructs as suggested in the Proposed Model of Social Competence and second, how these constructs contribute towards young children&#8217;s social competence. This research also intended to identify reliable and valid instruments that can be used for the comprehensive assessment of children&#8217;s social competence by therapists and educators in early childhood settings. Methodology and Study Findings First, a preliminary content validity study with Singaporean and Australian experts was conducted to investigate whether LRSS and IPS were represented by items from two pre-existing behaviour rating questionnaires (Lim, Rodger &amp; Brown, 2010b). Next, in the main study, 117 young children (aged 3 to 6 years) were assessed using a combination of naturalistic observational tools and behaviour rating questionnaires. The children were observed during free play and school work tasks and their teachers completed two behaviour rating questionnaires regarding the children&#8217;s social skills. Rasch analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were employed in this study to analyse the data. Results from the content validity study indicated that the two behaviour rating questionnaires selected for inclusion in this study contained items representing IPS and LRSS. In addition, the experts found it clinically useful to consider IPS and LRSS as two separate constructs exhibited by young children. In the main study, IPS and LRSS were found to exist as separate unidimensional constructs, in addition to two other constructs named Compliance and Group Social Interaction which were found to also exist. Scales with acceptable measurement properties were found within the existing social skills assessment tools to measure these constructs. Furthermore, the CFA revealed Social Competence as an underlying multidimensional factor that was composed of the four indicator variables IPS, LRSS, Compliance, and Group Social Interaction. As a result of this study, the Proposed Model of Social Competence was revised. Conclusions and Recommendations Different social skills constructs that contributed to social competence in young children were identified and validated in the study. As Social Competence is a multi-dimensional factor, it is insufficient to assess only children&#8217;s interpersonal social skills. The Model of Social Competence-Revised aims to guide occupational therapists and other professionals to consider different types of social skills and elements that may contribute to poor social competence. Depending on the different presenting concerns, practitioners can select specific instruments to assess the different types of social skills identified in this research. Instead of designing new assessment tools that measure newly hypothesised constructs, this study demonstrated a novel approach to extend the validity of existing instruments to measure new constructs (Lim, Rodger &amp; Brown, 2010a). This thesis has extended the extant body of literature by presenting the development, testing, and revision of a proposed theoretical model to assess young children&#8217;s social competence within early childhood contexts. This thesis has also contributed by identifying and validating existing assessment tools that can be used to evaluate the different social skills constructs observed in young children within early childhood environments.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social competence</field><field name="subject">interpersonal social skills</field><field name="subject">learning-related social skills</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">young children</field><field name="subject">assessment</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="subject">model</field><field name="subject">Rasch analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transnational Adoption and Constructions of Identity and Belonging: A Qualitative Study of Australian Parents of Children Adopted from Overseas</field><field name="creator">Indigo Willing</field><field name="description">Transnational adoption generates ample controversy both within and outside the adoption community. In recent times transnational adoption made international headlines following a wave of &#8216;celebrity adopters&#8217; and calls to airlift children for overseas adoption from the economically disadvantaged nation of Haiti in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake on 12th January 2010. Some see the practice as being about &#8216;rescuing&#8217; orphaned children, while others argue that it is parent-centred, intrinsically racist and represents a form of Western colonialism. Igniting such fears is the fact that transnational adoptions both in the past and at present, typically involve Non-White children from mostly Non-Western developing nations and adoptive parents of predominantly White, Western backgrounds. &#8232; &#8232; This thesis is based on research conducted from 2005 to 2010 among 35 transnationally adoptive parents who reside in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. The key question explored is: What impact does transnational adoption have on the lives of adoptive parents and their own sense of identity and belonging? In answering this question I consider the ways these parents legitimise, define and explain the role of being &#8216;suitable&#8217; carers of children adopted from overseas, with a particular focus on the racial, cultural and ethnic dimensions involved. This includes how they imagine, reconstruct and integrate aspects of adoptees&#8217; birth heritage into their family lives. &#8232; &#8232; The distinct feature of this thesis is that most existing adoption research in both Australia and overseas is overwhelmingly focused on the lives of adoptees and many of these studies are often conducted by researchers who themselves are White adoptive parents. This study represents an interesting contrast as it focuses on transnationally adoptive parents, written from the perspective of someone adopted from Vietnam into a White Australian family. &#8232; &#8232; The theoretical framework chosen to guide my research draws upon sociological studies on the family, on migration including cosmopolitanism and transnationalism, and issues of diversity such as critical race theory and studies of ethnicity. Such scholarship is well suited to explain the challenges adoptive parents face in building families who do not share blood ties or the same racial, cultural, ethnic and national backgrounds. The methodological approach is inductive, reflexive and employs multiple methods to generate qualitative data. This thesis is organised around three main stages across the participants&#8217; life course: before, during and after they have adopted. The findings were that most parents grew up in predominantly White environments, with many identifying as patriotic Australians in childhood before developing more cosmopolitan dispositions in adulthood. Most chose to adopt after struggling with issues of infertility but also claim to have been influenced by their interest in other cultures. However, in the process of adopting, the participants display frustration with the government&#8217;s adoption assessment process, which they viewed as highly bureaucratic and expecting an unfair level of cultural knowledge concerning adoptees&#8217; birth heritage.&#8232; &#8232; Despite these frustrations, all the participants were observed to attempt to integrate various &#8216;culture keeping&#8217; and symbolic ethnic practices into their lives in the lead up to adopting as well as after their adopted children joined them. A number also develop transnational ties to adoptees&#8217; countries of origin, such as sending financial remittances to surviving birth relatives and making return trips there. These combined activities and processes are observed to have a transformative effect on transnationally adoptive parents&#8217; constructions of identity resulting in a shift from many identifying as being &#8216;just&#8217; Australians to co-identifying with the ethnicity of their children or even describing themselves as &#8216;world citizens&#8217;. &#8232; &#8232; At the same time, most participants did not appear to have a significant level of understanding how issues of &#8216;racial&#8217; and cultural privilege shape and complicate their lives as Whites raising Non-White children in predominantly White environments. This includes lacking robust strategies to challenge forms of racism that can undermine their own status as &#8216;real&#8217; parents and their adopted children identities. As such, I conclude that further attention needs to be given to exposing and challenging how issues of race shape the lives of White transnationally adoptive parents and their ongoing efforts to be &#8216;suitable&#8217; carers of Non-White overseas born children.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">16 Studies in Human Society</field><field name="subject">transnational adoption</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">family</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">transnationalism</field><field name="subject">cosmopolitanism</field><field name="subject">Race</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Whiteness</field><field name="subject">adoption studies</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Goal-directed, environment-focused, outpatient rehabilitation for people with severe traumatic brain injury: process, effectiveness and influence of context.</field><field name="creator">Emmah Doig</field><field name="description">Literature: Acquired brain injury (ABI) results in significant personal, psychological, family, economic and social costs including medical, rehabilitation and care costs as well as loss of work. A primary cause of ABI is traumatic brain injury (TBI), which most commonly affects young people (19-25 years) who are in the establishment phase of their life. Research into the efficacy of treatment approaches and most appropriate outcome measures specific to people with TBI undergoing outpatient rehabilitation is scant. Firstly, goal planning and the use of goals is widely practised in neurological rehabilitation, however research investigating the efficacy of goal-directed approaches is very limited. Secondly, although goal planning and assessment tools such as the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) and the Goal Attainment Scale (GAS) have previously been used, there are no published studies investigating the clinical utility of their combined use in community-based rehabilitation for people with TBI. Thirdly, in practice, outpatient rehabilitation for this client group is conducted in clients&#8217; homes as well as hospital-based clinics (i.e., day hospitals). This reflects a broader shift toward the use of community-based services in health care. Qualitative findings suggest that providing rehabilitation in real-life, home settings may potentially be more beneficial for this client group. A systematic review of studies that compare outcomes of outpatient rehabilitation programs conducted at home with those conducted in outpatient clinic settings was conducted. Previous research had primarily focused on samples of people with stroke, often aged over 65 years. There are no previous controlled studies that investigate the impact of therapy context (real-life home contexts versus outpatient clinic contexts) on outcomes for people with TBI. Aims: The aim of this thesis was to investigate the application of community-based rehabilitation practice for people with TBI. This involved: A) exploring the process of client-centred, goal-directed rehabilitation and outcome measurement in a community-based rehabilitation context, B) determining the effectiveness of goal-directed rehabilitation, and C) investigating the influence of context on rehabilitation outcomes by comparing the effectiveness and experience of rehabilitation in a real-life setting (i.e., home and community) with a day hospital clinic context. The specific aims in terms of the process (Aim A) were: 1. to develop a set of practice principles to guide the rehabilitation of people with ABI living in the community, and 2. to investigate the clinical utility and treatment validity of the combined use of the COPM and GAS. The specific aims in relation to the effectiveness of goal-directed rehabilitation (Aim B) were: 1. to explore the clinical application of goal-directed therapy in community-based rehabilitation from the perspective of clients with TBI, their significant others and their treating occupational therapists, and 2. to compare the amount of clinical change on a range of outcome measures following a baseline and goal-directed intervention phase. The specific aims in terms of the influence of the context of rehabilitation on outcomes (Aim 3) were: 1. to determine whether the amount of clinical change differed when a goal-directed rehabilitation program was delivered in a home-based setting or a day hospital-based setting, and 2. to explore the client, family and therapist perspectives regarding the influence of the context (home and day hospital environments) on rehabilitation. Procedures: This thesis is based on two linked studies. The first was a pilot investigation of rehabilitation practice principles from the perspective of 10 health professionals experienced in working with people with ABI in community settings, using semi-structured interview techniques. Findings of the pilot investigation, and results of a review of available literature, were used to inform the development of a treatment program. The second and main study involved the implementation of the client-centred, goal-directed outpatient occupational therapy rehabilitation program. The study was a repeated measures crossover design with pre-test/post-test measures. Participants were 14 people with TBI recently discharged from inpatient rehabilitation. Following a six week baseline period, participants received six weeks of intervention at their home (A) and six weeks of intervention in a day hospital clinic (B), in addition to receiving their regularly scheduled day hospital occupational therapy program. To counterbalance order effects, participants were randomly allocated to a treatment setting sequence of home first (AB), or day hospital first (BA). Participants&#8217; program goals were set and all outcome assessments, including goal achievement, occupational performance, psychosocial integration, participation and environmental factors, were conducted by a researcher who was not involved in the treatment and was blinded to the treatment sequence. Each participant&#8217;s program was carried out to completion by one occupational therapist who was not told about the research hypothesis. The clinical utility of the combined use of GAS and the COPM was explored using parametric statistics and descriptive analysis. To determine whether the goal-directed intervention program was effective, scores post baseline and intervention phases were compared using non-parametric statistics. To determine whether there was a difference in outcomes dependent on treatment context, descriptive and non-parametric comparative analyses were used to compare change scores post the home and day hospital treatment phases on all outcome measures. The experience of the rehabilitation program and different rehabilitation contexts, from the perspective of the participants, their significant others and the treating therapists, was explored using semi-structured interviews. Two separate qualitative analyses of the interview data were conducted. First, to explore the application of goal-directed therapy, interview responses to questions relating to goal planning and goal-directed therapy were analysed thematically using the principles of the framework method. Second, to explore the interviewee&#8217;s opinions about the influence of the therapy context, the interview data were approached with a specific question, namely &#8220;how does the therapy environment (home and day hospital) impact on the process and outcomes of therapy?&#8221;. Interview data relating to this question were analysed using a manifest content analytic approach. Findings: In terms of the process of community-based rehabilitation for people with ABI living in the community, key practice principles identified by therapists in this field included the need for; 1. environment-focused and contextually appropriate rehabilitation, 2. a collaborative approach and inclusion of others in the rehabilitation process, especially the person&#8217;s support network, and 3. the use of a client-centred, goal-directed approach. In terms of the clinical utility of the combined use of the COPM and GAS in goal planning and assessment, results indicated that both measures were sensitive to change. Their combined use resulted in participants almost unanimously perceiving their goals as client-centred, despite most participants demonstrating moderate or severe impairment to self-awareness. Goal achievement was similar when participants were grouped according to no/mild, moderate or severe impairment to self-awareness. In terms of program effectiveness, the goal-directed rehabilitation program resulted in significant improvements in goal attainment, occupational performance, and psychosocial reintegration. Qualitative findings emphasised the value of goals in providing structure and motivation, the importance of goal ownership, and the importance of family involvement. A challenge of goal-directed therapy included the impact of cognitive difficulties and reduced self-awareness on goal planning. In terms of the influence of therapy context, the quantitative differences in gains made in home and day hospital settings were not statistically significant, with the exception of higher levels of client satisfaction with therapy at home. Qualitative findings in relation to the influence of therapy context on rehabilitation process and outcomes highlighted the experience of home-based therapy as more relaxing, normal, satisfying and effective compared with day hospital-based therapy. The home environment was described as a facilitator of a client-centred, functional approach, a closer therapeutic alliance, and greater therapeutic benefits, whereas the day hospital environment was described as a barrier to these processes. The day hospital environment was also described as a facilitator of: opportunities for patients to socialise with old friends and staff; easy access to a range of remedial activities; professional support for therapists; and better efficiency due to no travel time for therapists. Conclusions: The use of a client-centred, goal-directed approach is effective in assisting people with TBI undergoing outpatient rehabilitation to make clinically significant gains in performance. A therapist-facilitated, structured goal planning process in which the client, therapist and significant others work in partnership, can enhance the process of goal planning and goal-directed community rehabilitation. Impairment to self-awareness and reduced participation in goal planning, which is commonly reported in this population, may necessitate a therapist-led approach during initial goal planning. However, this approach does not necessarily result in a lack of goal identification, goal achievement or lack of participation in community rehabilitation. Furthermore, the COPM and GAS were sensitive to change, and their combined use in planning goals and measuring progress within this population was effective in enabling objective, therapist assessment of performance of individualised, client-centred goals. In terms of the treatment context, client outcomes were equivalent whether therapy was carried out in a day hospital or home setting. However, people with TBI and their family members largely preferred receiving therapy in the home setting for practical and psychological reasons. &#8195;</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Democracy and Tragedy in Ancient Athens and Today</field><field name="creator">Mark Chou</field><field name="description">Democracy and tragedy were intrinsically linked during the time of the Athenian city-state. Yet this symbiosis, vital as it was then, is largely forgotten today. The dearth of serious political discussion is all the more puzzling since political scientists and international relations scholars write extensively on tragedy and democracy, often via a return to ancient Athens. However, these efforts have largely neglected the intrinsic links between democracy and tragedy; preferring instead to focus on either democracy or tragedy. Exploration of their essential links has, by and large, become confined to studies in philology and cultural history. The objective of this Thesis is to explore the contemporary political relevance of the ancient symbiosis of democracy and tragedy. It argues that the most politically important insight of this symbiosis today stems from tragedy&#8217;s so-called multivocal form: its ability to bring a variety of &#8211; otherwise marginalised &#8211; stories, characters and voices onto the public stage and into democratic debate. In particular, this Thesis explores two novel lessons that tragedy&#8217;s multivocal form can potentially teach contemporary democrats seeking to extend the institutions and procedures of democracy in the age of globalisation. The first is the understanding that the idea and practice of democracy should not be solely concerned with the institution of order in political life. Tragedy teaches us the lesson that while order is necessary for a stable and productive communal existence sites of disorder too provide insights into dilemmas posed by political instability, inequality, exclusion, and flux. A truly democratic order must seek to include and give voice to democratic disorder. Given this, the second lesson that this Thesis highlights from its study of Athenian tragedy&#8217;s multivocal form is the need to draw on both factual and fictional sources of knowledge in an effort to negotiate and overcome contemporary democratic dilemmas. Only by broadening the scope of reality, through a resort to fiction, can democrats hope to legitimate a variety of &#8211; otherwise marginalised &#8211; stories, characters and voices today.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">international relations, democracy, Athenian tragedy, political philosophy, cultural history, theatre studies, classics.</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216174</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal Drill Assignment for Multi-Boom Jumbos</field><field name="creator">Michael Champion</field><field name="description">Development drilling is used in underground mining to create access tunnels. A common method involves using a drilling rig, known as a jumbo, to drill holes into the face of a tunnel. Jumbo drill rigs have two or more articulated arms with drills as end-effectors, that extend outwards from a vehicle. Once drilled, the holes are charged with explosives and fired to advance the tunnel. There is an ongoing imperative within the mining industry to reduce development times and reducing time spent drilling is seen as the best opportunity for achieving this. Notwithstanding that three-boom jumbos have been available for some years, the industry has maintained a preference for using jumbo rigs with two drilling booms. Three-boom machines have the potential to reduce drilling time by as much as one third, but they have proven difficult to operate and, in practice, this benefit has not been realized. The key difficulty lies in manoeuvering the booms within the tight confines of the tunnel and ensuring sequencing the drilling of holes so that each boom spends maximum time drilling. This thesis addresses the problem of optimally sequencing multi-boom jumbo drill rigs to minimize the overall time to drill a blast hole pattern, taking into account the various constraints on the problem including the geometric constraints restricting motion of the booms. The specific aims of the thesis are to: &#178; develop the algorithmic machinery needed to determine minimum- or near-minimum-time drill assignment for multi-boom jumbos which is suitable for "real-time" implementation; &#178; use this drill pattern assignment algorithm to quantify the benefits of optimal drill pattern assignment with three-boom jumbos; and &#178; investigate the management of unplanned events, such as boom breakdowns, and assess the potential of the algorithm to assist a human operator with the forward planning of drill-hole selection. Jumbo drill task assignment is a combinatorial optimization problem. A methodology based around receding horizon mixed integer programming is developed to solve the problem. At any time the set of drill-holes available to a boom is restricted by the location of the other booms as well as the tunnel perimeter. Importantly these constraints change as the problem evolves. The methodology builds these constraints into problem through use of a feasibility tensor that encodes the moves available to each boom given configurations of other booms. The feasibility tensor is constructed off-line using a rapidly exploring random tree algorithm. Simulations conducted using the sequencing algorithm predict, for a standard drill-hole pattern, a 10 - 22% reduction in drilling time with the three-boom rig relative to two-boom machines. The algorithms developed in this thesis have two intended applications. The first is for automated jumbo drill rigs where the capability to plan drilling sequences algorithmically is a prerequisite. Automated drill rigs are still some years from being a reality. The second, and more immediate application is in providing decision support for drill rig operators. It is envisaged that the algorithms described here might form the basis of a operator assist that provides guidance on which holes to drill next with each boom, adapting this plan as circumstances change.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Predictive control</field><field name="subject">mixed integer linear programming</field><field name="subject">Underground mining</field><field name="subject">mission planning</field><field name="subject">mining automation</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216172</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary Dynamics of Indo - Pacific Reef Corals throughout the Neogene</field><field name="creator">Kate Bromfield</field><field name="description">The origin of marine biodiversity in the Indo-Pacific is poorly known. Faunal turnover in scleractinian reef corals has been hypothesised over the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (~5 Ma), in the Malay Archipelago. However, there is little information available on origination and extinction events in reef corals during the same period for the broader Indo-Pacific region. This is important because many species probably had a wider distribution than previously thought, and many more genera than has previously been estimated were probably present in the Indo-Pacific during the Neogene. Here I begin to fill the gap in our knowledge by reporting on the taxonomic composition and diversity of Neogene reef coral communities sampled from Indonesia (Salayar), Papua New Guinea (New Britain), and Fiji (Vanua Balavu). Sampling locations were chosen on their reported age, fossil content and preservation quality. Ages were refined using foraminiferal assemblages and Strontium 87/86 isotope ages of samples collected at the sampling locations. This dual approach confirms a middle Miocene to early Pleistocene age range for the collection. I described 155 species of reef forming corals collected across an Indo-Pacific longitudinal gradient. Twenty-two constitute new, extinct species from the genera Alveopora, Astreopora, Caulastrea, Cyphastrea, Echinopora, Euphyllia, Galaxea, Leptoria, Leptoseris, Madracis, Montipora, Platygyra, Symphyllia and Turbinaria. A further 42 taxa could not be assigned to species level due to poor preservation, but may well be additional new, extinct species. I uncovered a general pattern of coral turnover across the Indo-Pacific by investigating the degree to which coral communities (using both presence/absence and relative abundance of both coral species and genera) varied with water depth, time and geographical distribution. Coral communities were found to vary with global sea level and time. Thus global changes in sea level through time potentially drove extinction and origination in Indo-Pacific Neogene corals. Inverse Lyellian analysis indicates that of species present in the Miocene in New Britain, a mean of 41.8% are now extinct, possibly resulting from restricted flow of oceanic currents in that region. Indonesia (mean = 9.4%); and Fiji (mean = 6.6%) both had significantly lower proportions of extinct species. However, there is a decline in the number of extinct species found at any location from the middle Miocene (mean = 23.2%) to the early Pleistocene (mean = 1.8%). This study supports previously proposed models of an early Pliocene turnover event in Scleractinia in the Indo-Pacific.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indo-pacific</field><field name="subject">Neogene</field><field name="subject">Scleractinia</field><field name="subject">origination</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:216171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of physiologic measurements of left ventricular function to guide clinical practice.</field><field name="creator">James Hare</field><field name="description">Assessment of left ventricular (LV) function is one of the most common requests made to cardiac imaging services. This demand stems from a large body of evidence that shows abnormal LV systolic and, more recently, diastolic function has important prognostic and treatment related implications for patients with a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. The vast majority of information supporting the use of conventional measures of LV function, such as ejection fraction, originates from population studies and large clinical trials. However, the application of these measurements to individual patients is far less defined, especially when used for serial evaluation. Central to these concerns is the relative paucity of data surrounding the test-retest reliability of conventional measures in clinical settings. Newer measures of LV function have been developed over recent years, with several techniques becoming widely used in clinical practice (i.e. tissue Doppler imaging) and others remaining largely research tools (i.e. 3D echocardiography, tissue strain/strain rate). Possible benefits of new technologies include improved identification and early detection of myocardial disease, improved reliability for monitoring progression of disease, and the development of novel methods to assess response to therapy. Despite this potential, the application and clinical utility of these techniques above and beyond more conventional measures remains in many cases to be adequately characterized. This thesis addresses several of these issues: from variability of novel and conventional measures of LV function in clinical practice, to new applications of novel functional measures in clinical settings.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">left ventricle</field><field name="subject">Echocardiography</field><field

Responses include intense fear, helplessness or horror. Symptoms are characterised into clusters, described as re-experiencing, avoidance, and arousal. These symptoms, which are also evident in other conditions, have been associated with dysfunctions in the central acetylcholinergic system. Benefits from administering acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEI) to people suffering these symptoms have been demonstrated. Donepezil hydrochloride, a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, is used in the treatment of conditions with difficulties in cognitive function, but has not been used in PTSD. The aim of this thesis was to determine (1) whether there was a difference in the ACh system in people with PTSD and (2) whether administration of an AChEI would change the symtomatology. IDEX (I&#185; &#178; &#179; iododexetimide) has been useful in imaging muscarinic-ACh receptors using Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography (SPECT) and was utilised to investigate whether cholinergic activity in PTSD is altered. One hundred and sixty eight potential subjects were screened and eleven PTSD subjects were enrolled in the IDEX SPECT study. Three healthy non-PTSD control subjects also completed the study. Due to technical complications only the data obtained from eight PTSD and two control subjects was available for analysis. Imaging data for 2 further healthy non-PTSD control subjects were obtained from another study. Sixteen subjects were enrolled in the donepezil open label study (assessed at baseline, Week 2, 6 and 10). Nine PTSD subjects completed the 10-week trial and seven withdrew prematurely (at or after Week 2) due to side effects or a worsening of PTSD symptoms. For the IDEX SPECT study, a voxel-by-voxel statistical analysis of the PTSD subject group versus the control group showed both areas of reduced and increased IDEX uptake. Significant clusters in the PTSD group with a reduced IDEX uptake centred around the bilateral hippocampus, left insula and right precuneus, while increased IDEX uptake appeared in the caudate head. For the donepezil study, in the per-protocol analysis (including only the 9 subjects that completed the protocol), all psychological assessments revealed a difference between the totals obtained at the Week 10 visit compared to those at the Baseline visit and the improvement was in the order of 51%. The intention-to-treat analysis (including all 16 subjects), a repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with a mixed models approach showed that all psychological measures demonstrated statistically significant benefits of the treatment. All subjects who completed the protocol recounted considerable improvement in their overall PTSD symptom profile, which covered symptoms in each of the three clusters. The results of the IDEX SPECT study suggest that alterations in ACh binding in PTSD are evident and may begin to explain a part of the altered cognitive symptomatology apparent in this condition. The pilot open label donepezil trial provided some preliminary evidence that treatment with an AChEI can lessen the intrusions and distress associated with traumatic memories in people with PTSD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; PTSD; acetylcholine; ACh; IDEX; donepezil; SPECT; acetylcholinesterase inhibitor</field><field name="subject">Acetylcholine.</field><field name="subject">Post-traumatic stress disorder.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/56315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutrient sources and dynamics in the Parafield stormwater harvesting facility and implication to water quality control.</field><field name="creator">Kim, Young-Kil.</field><field name="description">The quantity of stormwater runoff from the city of Adelaide almost matches the demand for drinking water. It therefore becomes increasingly important as an alternative source for water supply. This research focused at the Parafield Stormwater Harvesting Facility near Adelaide in order to better understand: (1) nutrient dynamics between the water column, sediments and plant community, (2) allochthonous and autochthonous sources of nutrients and (3) nutrient retention capacity of the reed bed. A weekly monitoring programme for the physical and chemical parameters of the water column, sediment and plant community was carried out over three years for specific locations within the reed bed. Ordination and clustering of the time series data revealed distinctive seasonal and spatial nutrient patterns. The concentrations for total nitrogen (TN) showed high concentrations for the summer period (1.04 to 1.86 mg/L) and low concentration for the winter season (0.25 to 0.46 mg/L). For the other nitrogen fractions in form of nitrate (NO&#8323;&#8315;) and ammonium (NH&#8324;&#8314;) the seasonal patterns were different to that of TN. In NO&#8323;&#8315; the concentrations were high during the summer and winter seasons and NH&#8324;&#8314; showed high concentration during the spring. The seasonality for total phosphorus (TP) showed high concentration for the spring period (0.049 to 0.163 mg/L) and low concentration for the other seasons (0.01 to 0.019 mg/L). A similar pattern has been observed for phosphate (PO&#8324;&#179; &#8315;) as well. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations showed high concentrations during the summer period (21.36 to 31.64 mg/L) and low concentration during the winter seasons (5.48 to 7.14 mg/L). The seasonal pattern for the nutrient contents of the plant community showed highest concentrations during summer (5.5 to 34.2 gTN/kg) and lowest concentrations in winter (0.2 to 7.7 gTN/kg). Nutrient concentrations in the sediments were highest during the non-growing seasons (autumn and winter). This result indicated that the function of sediments changes seasonally from being a sink during the non-growing season by accumulating both allochthonous and autochthonous nutrients in the rainy season, and becoming a source during the growing seasons due to nutrient release from anaerobic sediments supporting the growth of the macrophyte community. Overall the function of sediment in reed bed pond of the Stormwater Harvesting Facility was to be a source of nutrients and therefore no accumulation of nutrients occurred during the study period. The research has demonstrated that the reed bed currently performs as a reasonable nutrient retention system with following nutrient removal rates: 0.85 mg TN /m&#178;/day, 0.79 mg NO&#8323;&#8315; /m&#178;/day, 0.28 mg NH&#8324;&#8314;/m&#178;/day, 0.05 mg TP /m&#178;/day, 0.04 mg PO&#8324;&#179; &#8315; /m&#178;/day, and 5.75 mg DOC /m&#178;/day. Seasonal difference in the water retention time showed that the for most of the nutrients the removal performance was most effective during autumn and winter with the exception of the removal performance of P forms, which most effective during spring and summer. For TN, NO&#8323;&#8315; and DOC the RE was most efficient at a residence time &gt; 15days, for TP and PO&#8324;&#179; &#8315; it is 5-10 days and for NH&#8324;&#8314; it is &lt;;5days. Time&#8211;series modelling of the monitoring data resulted in rule-based prediction models for the different nutrients. Sensitivity analyses of the models revealed key driving variables for the nutrient dynamics of the reed bed. The prediction results revealed that the DO was the key driving variable influencing the nutrient concentrations in the water column and therefore to improve the water quality of the treatment water DO levels have to maintained above the threshold of 4 mg/L. Beside DO other key driving variables were turbidity, ORP and the nutrient levels from the previous site. Therefore the control of these parameters would be the start to develop a management plan for best-practice management in terms of water quality at the Parafield Stormwater Harvesting Facility.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parafield stormwater harvesting facility; constructed wetland; stormwater; nitrogen; phosphorus; dissolved organic carbon; management</field><field name="subject">Water quality management South Australia Adelaide Region.</field><field name="subject">Runoff South Australia Adelaide Region.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/57033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of viticultural treatments on the accumulation of flavonoid compounds in grapes and their contribution to wine quality.</field><field name="creator">Cordon, Nicole</field><field name="description">The grape flavonoids include anthocyanins, tannins and flavonols, all of which contribute to grape and wine quality by influencing the colour and mouthfeel of red wine. These compounds are synthesized in different parts of the berry and during different stages of berry development. In addition, environmental and viticultural factors such as light exposure can also alter the flavonoid composition of grapes. An understanding of how synthesis of these compounds is coordinated, their relationship to wine quality and the influence of bunch light exposure on the flavonoid composition of grapes, could be used to improve fruit quality by enhanced viticultural management. The first part of this study sought to investigate the relationship between the different products of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway (anthocyanins, flavonols and tannins), from two climatic regions (warm and cool) and determine their role in grape and wine quality. In collaboration with a major winery, whole Shiraz grapes were sampled at the weighbridge from a range of different vineyards from two climatic regions; warm (Riverland) and cool (McLaren Vale) in 2003 and 2004. A total of 80 grape samples were collected in each season and processed (i.e. 100 berries, separated into skin, seeds and juice, weighed and frozen). Anthocyanins and flavonols were measured, in triplicate, in skins by HPLC. Tannins were determined in the skins and seeds by two methods; phloroglucinol hydrolysis (HPLC) and protein precipitation (UV-VIS spectrophotometer). A comprehensive comparison of the two methods is discussed. In both years, the grapes from warm and cool climates formed two distinct data sets based on flavonoid composition. There was a correlation between anthocyanins and flavonols for both the warm and cool climate samples in both years, however those from the warm region had lower anthocyanin for a given level of flavonol. As expected, the level of tannin in the seeds was greater than in skin for all samples. In both years, there was a weak correlation between anthocyanin levels in the skin and skin tannins, but no relationship with seed tannins. These results suggest there is some co-ordination in the synthesis of anthocyanins, flavonols and skin tannins. Also, the two regions clearly separated based on yield and despite the weak correlations in both regions, the levels of total anthocyanins were inversely related to yield. In addition, there was no relationship with any of the flavonoids and grape quality, indicating the need for improvement in streaming fruit for quality using these flavonoid compounds. The second part of the study was to investigate the effect of bunch light exposure on flavonol synthesis and accumulation in Shiraz and Chardonnay grapes during development. Light-excluding boxes were applied to bunches at budburst. Boxes were removed at four sampling times; flowering, pre-veraison, veraison and harvest. At each sampling time, berry skins were sampled when the boxes were removed and then every second day (light induced), along with exposed controls for one week. Flavonol accumulation and flavonol synthase (VvFLS1) gene expression was determined by HPLC and Real Time-PCR (RT-PCR) respectively. As expected, for all four sampling times, flavonol accumulation and VvFLS1 expression in the boxed fruit was significantly less than bunches exposed to light. On removal of boxes at flowering, pre-veraison and veraison, flavonols accumulated to levels similar to that of the exposed control fruit over a period of 4-6 days. There was a significant increase in VvFLS1 expression 2 days after exposure to light in parallel with the accumulation of flavonols. At harvest, in Chardonnay, VvFLS1 expression peaked by day 4, while in Shiraz VvFLS1 expression increased linearly and was highest at day 6. In contrast to the results for the earlier sampling times, the total amount of flavonols accumulated at harvest was less than 50% of exposed controls in Chardonnay and Shiraz grapes. These results show that flavonols are able to be induced by bunch light exposure at different times during berry development, including times when flavonols are not normally being synthesised. This suggests bunch light exposure can override the developmental control of flavonol accumulation. To further investigate the light induced expression of VvFLS1 in grapevines the molecular mechanism of transcriptional control was explored. Using genomic walking PCR techniques, two Shiraz VvFLS1 promoter sequences were cloned and their sequences were analysed. These promoter sequences were ~800bp in length and were 99% identical. A putative MYB responsive element (MRE) and several light responsive elements (LRE) were identified in the promoter region of these genes. To functionally test the VvFLS1 promoter(s), a transient assay was developed in Chardonnay suspension cells. Cells were bombarded with constructs containing potential transcription factors and the VvFLS1 promoter(s), fused to a luciferase reporter vector. After 48hrs incubation in the dark, cells were harvested and luciferase activity measured as an indicator of VvFLS1 promoter activity. Of the different transcription factors tested with the VvFLS1 promoter(s) the highest luciferase activity was observed using AtMYB12 (a flavonol-specific regulator of AtFLS1 in Arabidopsis (Mehrtens et al. 2005). While this result shows activation of the VvFLS1 promoters by AtMYB12 and the development of a transient reporter assay for testing the VvFLS1 promoter(s) a grapevine transcription factor specific for VvFLS1 was sought. Two techniques were employed to identify potential transcription factor regulators of the VvFLS1 promoter(s). The first involved BLAST sequence search analysis in a grapevine expression (EST) database with AtMYB12 and the second involved using DNA microarray technology to identify candidate transcription factors that were up-regulated in light exposed Chardonnay cell suspension cultures. Thirteen potential transcription factors were identified and after correlative RT-PCR analysis (with VvFLS1 expression patterns) two candidates were selected for further isolation and characterisation. These results have made significant progress in unravelling the molecular mechanisms of regulation of the flavonol biosynthetic, however additional experiments are required to unravel the transcriptional control of flavonol biosynthesis. This investigation contributes to our knowledge of flavonoid synthesis in grapes; how it is coordinated, the relationship with wine quality, and the influence of light particularly on synthesis of flavonols. It also explores the molecular mechanisms of VvFLS1 control, through isolation of the VvFLS1 promoter and identification of potential transcription factors, which may regulate it. An understanding of the synthesis of flavonoids and how they may be coordinated, particularly in response to light, could be used to improve fruit quality by enhanced viticultural management.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">grapevine; flavonoids; quality; berry development; light temperature; wine; shading; transcription factor</field><field name="subject">Flavonoids</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/58582</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Affective change in adult students in second chance mathematics courses : three different teaching approaches</field><field name="creator">Miller-Reilly, Barbara Joy</field><field name="description">A case study approach was used to explore second-chance mathematics through two larger courses and one individual study program. A different teaching approach, by committed experienced teachers, was used in each course. In evaluating their effectiveness, I focused on affective change in the students, relating this to their achievement. This study contributes to research on understanding good teaching of mathematics to adults. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected over several years. Methods included: a questionnaire (including mathematics attitude and belief scales as well as demographic and open questions); interviews with students to gather more affective data and explore their reactions to the course approach; and the individual supervised study course was audio-taped for six months. Teachers of the larger courses were also interviewed about their goals for, and experiences with, the students. These multiple strands of evidence provide a complex overall picture of three, largely successful, teaching approaches. Each measure had its own contribution to make, and taken together they illuminated the ways in which affective change was related to ackevement in the three contexts. The higher achieving groups in each of the two larger courses entered the courses with more positive attitudes and beliefs than the lower achieving groups and subsequent affective changes reinforced these differences. The lower achieving groups completed the courses affectively worse off than when they started, Students' reactions to these approaches were compared and found to reflect the nature of the approach. In addition to this finding, successhl students' beliefs about mathematics changed in two of the courses. In the one-to-one course the teacher focused initially on understanding the students' fear of mathematics and early mathematical experiences. The student-focused teaching approach trusted and encouraged the growth of ths student's mathematical thinking. Six months later the student felt empowered and had come to believe that mathematics as a creative and enjoyable process of discovering patterns. The second course focused on the mathematization of realistic situations. Successful students came to regard mathematics as useful, interesting, relating to real life. Successful students in the third course appreciated the carefully structured reintroduction to mathematics and were pleased they could finally do the mathematics they hadn't been able to understand at high school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Education, Mathematics (0280)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/42</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The electronic, structural, and magnetic properties of the chromium dihalides - from the gas-phase to the solid-state : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Chemistry at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vest, Brian Michael</field><field name="description">Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (broken symmetry) density functional calculations have been used to determine the low-energy geometries of the chromium dihalide molecules (CrX2) and their clusters, Cr2X4, Cr3X6, and Cr4X8. The monomers are also investigated at a higher level, including coupled-cluster and state-average CASSCF computations. Our calculations show that the monomers have a 5B2 ground state arising from the Renner-Teller distorted 5IIg transition state, leading to a bent geometry. The global minima of the gas-phase clusters of CrF2 and CrCl2 consist of two-dimensional, anti-ferromagnetically coupled chains of CrX2 units forming four-membered, doubly bridged Cr2X2 rings, closely resembling their solid-state structures. The global minima of the CrBr2 and CrI2 clusters consist of the same two-dimensional chain-like structures for their dimers, but their trimers and tetramers consist of three-dimensional &#8217;triangular&#8217; structures which contain two capping ligands bound to three chromium atoms along with a Cr-Cr bond. Each Cr atom within these clusters has spin quantum number S=2. There is approximately a constant change in energy, between 45-55 kcal/mol, with every new CrX2 unit during cluster formation. Information about the structure of the CrCl2 clusters is used in the reanalysis of high-temperature electron diffraction data. The vapor at 1170 K contains about 77% monomeric molecules, 19% dimers, and a small amount of trimers. Monomeric CrCl2 is found to be bent with a bond angle of 149(10)degrees, in good agreement with our computations. Solid-state DFT calculations are performed on alpha-CrCl2 to determine the lattice structure and spin-coupling constants for the Cr atoms within the crystals. The GGA (PW91) method produces a structure in good agreement with the literature. In the lowest energy structure, the spins of the Cr atoms within the chains along the crystallographic c-axis are anti-ferromagnetically coupled with four parallel spins situated almost exclusively in the d-bands of Cr along these chains. This anti-ferromagnetic coupling is also seen in the CrX2 clusters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromium dihalides</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generic electric propulsion drive : a thesis in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Engineering in Mechatronics at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edmondson, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">Considerable resources worldwide are invested in the research and development of future transportation technology. The foreseen direction and therefore research of future personalised transportation is focused on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or hybrid combinations that use hydrogen fuel cells. These new transport energy systems are consider most to replace the current vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine (ICE). The research work presented in this thesis mainly focuses on the development of a software control system for future BEV prototype vehicles - a generic intelligent control system (GICS). The system design adopts a modular design concept and intelligent control. The whole system consists of four modules being communication, power supply, motor driver and transmission module. Each module uses a microcontroller as the brain and builds an embedded control system within the module. The control and communication between the modules is based on a group of specific parameters and the status of a state machine. In order to effectively implement intelligent control and simplify the system structure and programming, a generic intelligent fuzzy logic model that can be configured to a specific application with a near real-time buffered communication methodology is developed. The tests made on the fuzzy control model and the near real-time buffered communication gave a very positive outcome. The implementation of the fuzzy control and the communication methodology in each of the modules results in a communication between the modules with a steady speed, better reliability and system stability. These modules link together through the communication channels and form a multi-agent collaborative system (MACS). As the controllers are designed based on the parametric concept, the system is able to be implemented to future new modules and therefore allow prototype vehicle control systems to be developed more efficiently. The MACS is based on the core components of the control system - fuzzy logic controller (FLC), Serial Communication and Analogue input control software modules. Further work is carried out as an attempt to integrate the control software with a hardware design for a generic electric propulsion drive (GEPD). This thesis therefore outlines the design and considerations in software and hardware integration in addition to the GICS. The output from this thesis being the construction of soft programming modules for embedded microcontroller based control system has been accepted and presented at two international conferences; one in Wellington, New Zealand[1] the second in Acireale, Italy[2].</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">electric propulsion drive</field><field name="subject">mechatronics</field><field name="subject">Battery Electric Vehicles</field><field name="subject">software control system</field><field name="subject">generic intelligent fuzzy logic model</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290400 Automotive Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing nutrition risk of older New Zealanders : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Carr, Rosemary Joy</field><field name="description">As the population ages it is increasingly important to understand the factors influencing dietary habits of older people. Social, biological and psychological factors influence food intake and affect nutrition risk among older people living in the community. The purpose of this study was to identify food-related behaviours that place older people at nutrition risk and to evaluate older peoples&#8217; perceptions and experiences of various nutrition support options. Fifty-one community living people aged between 80 and 85 years were recruited in North Shore City. Food-related behaviours were explored with the use of three quantitative tools. Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) was used to evaluate social networks. Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) was used to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing. Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) assessed nutrition risk. Five people participated in a qualitative interview about nutrition support they had received. A third of the participants (31 percent) were found to be at nutrition risk. Twothirds (67 percent) showed some evidence of disability and needed assistance with everyday tasks. Nearly half (47 percent) of these older people had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. There was an inverse linear relationship between participants&#8217; self-rated health and nutrition risk (p&lt;.001). Those who perceived their health to be fair or poor were more likely to be at nutrition risk. The importance of social contact, a sense of gratitude, &#8216;getting a meal&#8217;, and &#8216;meeting the need&#8217; were common themes that emerged from interviews with participants who received nutrition support. These findings indicate that nutrition risk may be prevalent among community living older people in New Zealand. Strategies and initiatives are needed to encourage independent living and to help older people with the procurement, preparation, cooking and sharing of enjoyable meals.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nutrition</field><field name="subject">aged</field><field name="subject">old people</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/859</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of the health human resource development provisions of the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of Master of Public Policy, Massey University at Albany</field><field name="creator">Tiongco-Cruda, Beatriz</field><field name="description">Republic Act No. 9173, or the Philippine Nursing Act of 2002 enunciates a bevy of incentives under its Health Human Resource Production, Utilization and Development provisions, intended to stem the rising tide of Filipino nurses leaving the country to work overseas. Under Sections 30 to 34 of the Nursing Act, these incentives include the following: (1) upgrading the minimum base salary of nurses from salary grade 10 to 15; (2) establishing a nurse specialty program in government hospitals to upgrade the nurses&#8217; skills whereby recipients of the program are required to work in government hospitals for two years; and (3) the provision of other benefits such as scholarship grants, free medical care, etc. These provisions are the government&#8217;s policy response to mitigate the impact of nurses&#8217; migration and retain an adequate supply of skilled Filipino nurses in the country: This research is a qualitative study that seeks to assess the health human resource development provisions and their implementation and aims to help improve them. This study examines the responsiveness of the provisions to the needs of nurses, and identifies the deficiencies of the provisions by looking into the working conditions of nurses in two Philippine government hospitals. It also examines the processes and the factors affecting the implementation of the provisions. This study employed a combination of four data collection methods: (1) focus group interviews of nurses working in two Philippine government hospitals, (2) key informant interviews of officials of government agencies and private organizations tasked to implement the health human resource development provisions, (3) document analyses, and (4) researcher&#8217;s field notes/journal. The researcher conducted five focus group interviews with a total of 15 nurse participants and 12 key informant interviews.  The nurses are working under conditions of low salaries and heavy workload, that is characterized by low nurse-to-patient ratios in the National and LGU Hospitals. The problems of inadequate nurse staffing, large number iii of patients and inadequate supplies in the two government hospitals are identified as causes for the heavy workload of nurses. The nurses want a salary increase that is commensurate to their heavy workload, their professional qualifications and long years of service. For the nurses, a salary increase signifies the government&#8217;s recognition of their dedication, hard work, and commitment to provide health care to Filipinos despite working under dire circumstances. The nurse specialty training program in areas such as oncology, nephrology, critical care, etc. has not been implemented because of the limited capacities of government hospitals to provide this kind of training and the lack of regulatory framework for the practice of nurse specialists in the Philippines. The other benefits have not been implemented as well. The provisions of the Nursing Act are deficient because they do not address the causes of the heavy workload of nurses. To improve the work conditions of nurses, the Philippine government needs to prioritize to the long neglected health sector by increasing the budgetary allocation in order to create more nurse positions in government hospitals, to provide adequate supplies and equipment for government hospitals and to improve the facilities for nurses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filipino nurses</field><field name="subject">government hospitals</field><field name="subject">nurses' working conditions</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of rice bran oil margarine with Flora margarine and Flora pro-activ margarine for lowering cholesterol : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Eady, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Phytosterols have been shown to be effective in reducing serum cholesterol levels in numerous human clinical studies and regular consumption is recommended as part of therapeutic lifestyle changes aimed at reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fat based spreads have been shown to be a very successful vehicle for delivery of plant sterols, readily accepted by consumers and efficacious in reducing cholesterol levels. Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread is a new product entering into the market place. It is derived from rice bran oil and contains high levels of unsaponifiable material rich in phytosterols, triterpene alcohols, ferulic acid esters ([gamma]-oryzanol) and vitamin E isomers. As such it may have the potential to lower serum cholesterol levels when consumed on a daily basis. In order to establish the effectiveness of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread compared with Flora pro-activ&#174; margarine, a well established brand of plant sterol margarine already proven to lower cholesterol, a randomised double blind cross-over human clinical trial over 12 weeks was conducted. The study was divided into two treatment arms. The first arm of the study was to determine whether Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread (containing 1.5% plant sterols) could lower total and LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than standard Flora margarine (containing no plant sterols) or Flora Pro-activ&#174; margarine (containing 8% plant sterols). The second study arm tested the proposition that daily consumption of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread in conjunction with rice bran oil (containing 0.5% plant sterols) would lower total and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in isolation and more than Flora margarine in conjunction with sunflower oil. Eighty mildly hypercholesterolaemic individuals (total cholesterol [greater than or equal to] 5 mmol/L and [less than or equal to] 7.5 mmol/L) were recruited and randomised into two groups of forty. Participants were asked to continue with their normal dietary pattern but to replace any margarine/butter/fat consumption with the trial products. One group of 40 were then assigned to the first treatment arm of the study (margarine-only group) and were randomised to consume 20 g (4 teaspoons) Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine daily for 4 weeks, or 20 Flora pro-activ&#174; daily for 4 weeks. Phytosterol levels delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma]-oryzanol; Flora proactiv&#174; 1600 mg phytosterol; Flora margarine 0mg phytosterol. The second group of 40 were allocated to the second arm of the trial (margarine and oil group) and consumed 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread and 30 ml rice bran oil (RBO) daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine and 30 ml sunflower oil daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, changing treatment at the end of each 4-week period. Phytosterol amounts delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118 mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma] oryzanol; RBO 222mg mg phytosterol, 150 mg [gamma] oryzanol. Each participant consumed all three treatments in a random order over a 12 week period. At baseline and following each 4 week intervention period, measurements were made of weight and blood pressure. Venous blood samples were collected for analysis of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol: HDL-C, triglycerides and plasma phytosterols. Three-day diet records from each individual were also collected for analysis of normal dietary intake. Results showed that compared to a standard Flora margarine, Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread significantly reduced total cholesterol by 2.2% (P=0.045), total cholesterol:HDL by 4.1% (P=0.005) and LDL-C by 3.5% (P=0.016), but was not as effective overall as Flora Pro-activ&#174; which reduced total cholesterol by 4.4% (P=0.001), total cholesterol:HDL by 3.4% (P=0.014) and LDL-C by 5.6% (P=0.001). Consumption of Flora margarine alone produced no significant decrease from baseline figures in any of the cholesterol parameters measured. Surprisingly, in group two, the addition of rice bran oil to the Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread produced no differences in cholesterol levels. The reason for this unexpected result is being explored further. These results confirm that Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread is effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels when consumed as part of a normal diet. Studies have shown that a 1% reduction in LDL-C can equate to a 2% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk thus suggesting that the 3.5% reduction demonstrated by Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in this study could be effective in reducing CHD risk as much as 6% in a mildly hypercholesterolaemic population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human nutrition</field><field name="subject">rice bran oil margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora pro-activ margarine</field><field name="subject">phytosterols</field><field name="subject">plant sterols</field><field name="subject">reduction of serum cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of blue pigments from the callus cultures of Lavandula augustifolia and red pigments (betalain) from the hairy root culture of Beta vulgaris : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Biotechnology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Oommen, Retty</field><field name="description">Plants are used to produce many secondary metabolites that are too difficult, expensive or impossible to make by chemical synthesis. Conventional cultivation of plants is of course subject to vagaries of weather, pests and availability of land; hence, the interest in highly controlled culture of plant cells and hairy roots in bioreactors as methods of producing various products. This project focussed on production of blue and red colors of Lavandula augustifolia and Beta vulgaris, respectively. Callus and suspension cell culture were successfully produced from L. augustifolia after extensive trials, but hairy roots could not be generated from this species. In contrast, a successful protocol was developed for consistently producing hairy roots from B. vulgaris, but calli could not be generated from this species. Effects of medium composition on growth of L. augustifolia calli and freely suspended cells and production of the blue pigment by the latter, were investigated. Optimal production of callus occurred in full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2 mg/l of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1 mg/l of kinetin. Stable suspension cultures could be produced and maintained in full-strength MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l each of IAA and kinetin. In suspension culture in full-strength MS medium, the following hormone combinations were tested: (1) 1 mg/l each of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and kinetin; (2) 2 mg/l of IAA and 1 mg/l of kinetin; (3) 2 mg/l of IAA and 1 mg/l of benzyl amino purine (BAP); and (4) 2 mg/l each of IAA and BAP. Combination (3) maximized cell growth, but the highest cell-specific production of the blue pigment was seen in combination (2), although pigment production occurred at all hormone combinations. The medium formulation that gave the best production of the pigment in shake flasks was scaled up to a 2 L aerated stirred tank bioreactor, but both the biomass and pigment productivities were reduced in the bioreactor apparently due to the high shear stress generated by the Rushton turbine impeller. Compared to suspension cultures of L. augustifolia, the hairy root cultures of B. vulgaris grew extremely rapidly. Hairy roots also produced large amounts of the red pigments. Growth of hairy roots was influenced by the composition of the medium. Although the full strength MS medium better promoted biomass growth compared to the half-strength MS medium, the final concentration of the biomass and the pigment were nearly the same in both media. Attempts were made to enhance production by using various hormones (i.e. naphthalene acetic acid, BAP, IAA added individually at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l), but none of the hormones proved useful. BAP adversely affected the growth of hairy roots. In summary, production of pigments by suspension culture of L. augustifolia and hairy root culture of B. vulgaris, is technically possible, but requires substantial further optimization for enhancing productivity than has been possible in this project. iii</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pigment production</field><field name="subject">biomass growth</field><field name="subject">lavender</field><field name="subject">beetroot</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Motor memory : reworking the past : a thesis (or dissertation, etc.) presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Masters in Fine Arts at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Titheridge, Johnathon Daniel</field><field name="description">Taking my own personal history as a starting point this paper will look at how we inherit culture and in turn shape it through the stories and objects that drive its formation. This extends into how these objects proliferate within our culture and the way in which the passing of History impacts on the way we view them and as a consequence ourselves as individuals and as a group. Identity is then passed on through generations through the act of storytelling, and this process is integral to this research paper. This is also a personal journey, taking place in varying sites, from a rusting car hulk in a back yard in North Canterbury, to a University in Wellington and another rusted car, which has gone through a strange restoration. The Morris Minor has been embraced as a narcissistic object that I have chosen to double in order to explore my individual and wider national cultural history and identity. One of the key themes of this inherited identity is largely based around Nostalgia for an ideal past. This ideal is a fiction, a layering of intended futures as well as a selective past. This works in the same way as the modern artistic preoccupation with gothic histories, but instead of a positive ideal we have the creation of a basement of horrors that lurks beneath the surface. Be it positivist idealism or Gothic inversion, one way of focusing on the way these fictions differ markedly from the reality of the objects existence, is to show the artifice of the stories told by enhancing the components of the story that are already exaggerated, for the Morris Minor this means getting as far away from its existence as a rusting hulk in the backyard as possible. The longing for a past that may or may not exist, is less important as existing in reality but instead for what these fictions supply in their retelling. The concept of the Uncanny is integral to this retelling of memory, in that through a memories reanimation it can only approximate the original event leaving gaps for circumspection and invention. This retelling necessitates a reorientation in the relationship between the teller of the tale and the listener and between the viewer and the object viewed. The research culminates in the alteration of a Morris Minor to appear as one continuous surface. The intention of which is to engage with the differing versions of the objects past through taking an active part in its reconstruction as artwork with the aim of reassessment not only of my individual approach to the object but also the viewers.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Morris Minor</field><field name="subject">Cultural artifacts</field><field name="subject">New Zealand culture</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Public prototyping : a participatory design process exploring the application of co-creative sketching : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design, Massey University, Institute of Communication Design, College of Creative Arts, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Pittar, Luke</field><field name="description">The objective of this research is to demonstrate that co-creative sketching as a part of the participatory process has the potential to support the developmental nature of a visual communication tool used to promote the exchange of experience. The tool is intended to create an informative hub that influences a travellers experience of a location. Ethnographic research as reflective sketching was conducted in the Tongariro National Park. Within this setting reflective sketching located the kitchen and common area of traveller specific accommodation as an ideal collaborative environment to conduct participatory design research. In this collaborative environment snowboarders and skiers who are aged between 20-30 years are identified as the target audience. This specific audience participated in co-creative sessions throughout the design process, resulting in the participatory design of the tool. The design aim of the visual communication tool was to promote the exchange of experience between snowboarders and skiers about a specific location. This was achieved by adapting generative tools made up of a visual language which supported the word of mouth exchange and individual expression. The exchange of experiences was facilitated by co-creative sketching with the visual language during a state of play. Playful co-creative sketching supported word of mouth dialogue between the snowboarders and skiers in a way that co-created an informative visual representation of the dialogue or contextmap. The resulting contextmap represented an image for experience which was beyond an individuals conception and made individuals tacit-knowledge accessible to audiences within and outside the moment of exchange, creating an informative hub which influenced the specific audiences view of experience for a location. An action research methodology is used during the course of this research, informed by the approaches of co-creation, context-mapping and generative tools. These approaches constructed a theoretical framework for the participatory development and co-creative sketching of the communication tool. This supportive thesis discusses the context, the theoretical concepts and provides an in depth account on the research through design process; the week-by-week participatory process undertaken to develop the visual communication tool.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication design</field><field name="subject">Co-creation</field><field name="subject">Visual communication</field><field name="subject">Snowboarding</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410300 Cinema, Electronic Arts and Media Studies::410306 Communications and media studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informative ornament: &#8216;The machine&#8217; : enhancing the communicative potential of colour : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design in Illustration at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Malcolm, Sabrina Barkley</field><field name="description">Accompanying workbook not available in digital format</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Illustration</field><field name="subject">Colour-blind</field><field name="subject">Visual communication design</field><field name="subject">Patterned colour</field><field name="subject">Wordless picture books</field><field name="subject">Fantasy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410202 Fine arts studies (incl. sculpture and painting)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combining Farmer Decision Making With Systems Models for Restoring Multi-Functional Ecohydrological Systems in Degraded Catchments</field><field name="creator">Justin Ryan</field><field name="description">In agricultural landscapes, native ecosystems are largely replaced by non-native crop and pasture species, with the extent of modification dependent on land use history and the management practices of current farmers. The result is greater complexity in some parts of the landscape, while other areas become more simplified. Of critical importance, however, is that many landscapes become &#8216;leaky&#8217; due to the impaired feedback mechanisms between the types of vegetation present (i.e. land cover) and their ability to efficiently cycle water, sediment, nutrients and carbon between the lower atmosphere, vegetation, soil, and hydrological systems, causing landscapes to become ecohydrologically dysfunctional. In many mixed cropping-grazing landscapes of Australia, ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes exhibit declines in soil condition, water quality and quantity, rising salinity levels, higher wind speeds and temperatures, reduced rainfall, and a loss of biodiversity and production capacity. Ecohydrologically dysfunctional landscapes also are less resilient to climatic variations, which during extended dry periods, can result in water shortages with potentially dire socioeconomic consequences. This Thesis focuses on how landscape designs comprised of particular types and locations of land covers can improve and restore the ecohydrological functioning of mixed cropping-grazing landscapes. The specific aim of this Thesis is to show &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; for the &#8211; development of a new modelling approach which automatically calculates the effects that land cover changes at specific locations across hillslopes have on ecohydrological systems functioning, and to use this information to delineate landscape designs that enhance water retention within the landscape while minimising sediment and nutrient export to the catchment. To support this aim, the Thesis has three major objectives: 1) develop a complex adaptive systems conceptual model of ecohydrological systems functioning within landscapes; 2) develop a participatory survey method to capture the expert knowledge of farmers in terms of preferences for a given land use and changes in these preferences during seasonal variations in rainfall; and 3) demonstrate &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; that a combination of expert systems and hydrological process models can be employed to automatically delineate landscape designs which restore ecohydrological functioning within mixed cropping-grazing landscapes in sub-tropical Australia. The development of a rigorous theoretical basis of ecohydrological systems function within the landscape in terms of adaptations to environmental flux in climate and human forcings such as land cover change, was achieved by integrating the concepts of both complex adaptive systems and landscape ecology theories. The resulting framework, termed &#8216;Complex Adaptive Landscapes&#8217; (CAL), derived six core tenets which described the system dynamics of a landscape: 1) a continuum of scales; 2) open systems; 3) non-linear feedback mechanisms; 4) aggregation of components; 5) self-organisation; and 6) multiple meta-stable states. The participatory survey method resulted in the development of the &#8216;Graphical Landscape Map Survey&#8217; (GLAMS). This process applied three-dimensional representations of the landscape (i.e. Graphical Landscape Maps) in combination with Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) to capture farmer&#8217;s expert knowledge. GLAMS generated probability estimates (P) that highlighted the importance of ecohydrological functioning to farmers and the locations and change in land use through time in both average and extended dry seasons. Achievement of the last objective resulted in the &#8216;Landscape Ecohydrological Attenuation Configuration System (LEACS). This system utilised farmer decision rules as probability estimates (P) for a given land cover within the STELLA systems software, and then revised these P estimates depending on the magnitude of runoff from a hillslope following an intense thunderstorm event as calculated by a distributed hydrological process model (MIKE SHE). The fundamental dynamics of the LECAS model was based on iterative feedback between the outputs of water at the end of the catchment and changing the spatial locations of particular land covers within the catchment over time. Together the three objectives highlighted the following major implications for natural resource and catchment management: i) the CAL framework may be used to design both sampling and monitoring strategies in natural resource and catchment management. CAL suggested that monitoring timeframes should be decadal in time-frame, and the feedback mechanisms of landscape must be accounted for if the longer-term sustainability of human-modified landscapes is to be achieved. A basis to such complexity is likely to form around aggregated components such as native vegetation patches, and these in turn, are important for self-organisation of a desirable landscape state to be maintained through increased resilience to disturbances and climatic fluxes; ii) participatory survey methods, such as GLAMS, are an excellent means to capture farmer expert knowledge in a manner that is intuitive to the farmers. The GLAMS approach accounted for any desired set of management actions put forward by a Landcare group or catchment body, differentiated between property sizes, and incorporated landscape heterogeneity in time and space. The framework helped to prioritise the level of support for a given set of NRM actions by farmers, including where activities were best placed. The approach also aided in identifying future landscape states based on a priori conditions and farmer preferences; and iii) the LEACS model demonstrated an approach capable of providing estimates of where it would be best to locate land cover changes (e.g. tree belts) to aid in the restoration of ecohydrological functioning in the landscape. A secondary outcome for simulations which tested the effects of tree belts in specific configurations was that these designs were an effective ecohydrological restoration technique that reduced water velocities and increased infiltration across steep hillslopes in the Maronghi Creek catchment, Southeast Queensland.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:131285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors affecting milk protein concentration and composition of dairy cattle in the sub-tropical regions of northern Australia.</field><field name="creator">David Graham BARBER</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:151571</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and promoter analysis of Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase gene</field><field name="creator">Nontachaiyapoom, Sureeporn</field><field name="description">Legume-rhizobia symbioses contribute at least 20% of the biosphere's supply of reactive nitrogen. These unique associations rely on the exchange of specific molecular signals between nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, collectively called rhizobia, and their host plants and, with few exceptions, result in the formation of root nodules, which provide an environment suitable for nitrogen fixation. However, nitrogen fixation is energetically expensive and nodule proliferation, in much the same manner as the proliferation of other meristems in plants, must be controlled in order to attain equilibrium between cell proliferation and differentiation. Nodule proliferation is controlled primarily and systemically by autoregulation of nodulation (AON). A gene central to this process was first isolated by map-based cloning from soybean (Glycine max) and was named G. max Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK) in accordance with its biochemical and physiological functions. Expression patterns of GmNARK have been described by several investigators; however, these reports were based on either non-quantitative methods or a limited number of tissue types. More importantly, the expression domains of GmNARK were completely unknown. The study described in this thesis utilised techniques such as quantitative RT-PCR (QRTPCR), transcription start site mapping, promoter-reporter gene fusion, and promoter deletion, to analyse the expression levels and domains of GmNARK across a variety of tissues as well as identify the promoter elements that are responsible for the basal and tissue-specific expression of GmNARK. In addition, the promoter activity of GmNARK was also compared with that of Lotus japonicus HAR1, the GmNARK orthologue, in both homologous and heterologous transformation systems. Based on QRT-PCR, GmNARK was expressed to varying levels throughout the plant; the transcript was detected at high levels in mature leaves and roots but to a lesser extent in young leaves, shoot tips and nodules. The transcript level was not significantly affected by Bradyrhizobium japonicum during the first week following inoculation. Histochemical analysis of L. japonicus plants carrying either a 1.7 kb GmNARK promoter or 2.0 kb LjHAR1 promoter fused to a beta-glucuronidase reporter gene localised GUS activity to living cells within vascular bundles, especially phloem cells in leaves, stems, roots, and nodules. Phloem-specific expression was also detected in soybean hairy roots carrying these constructs. These results suggested that both cis- and trans-acting elements required for the transcriptional regulation of these orthologous genes are likely to be conserved. In contrast, 1.7 kb of the GmNARK promoter did not drive phloem-specific expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, indicating the absence of the trans-acting elements required for the tissue-specificity of GmNARK in this distantly related species. The comparison of 2.0 kb of promoter sequences of GmNARK, LjHAR1 and Medicago truncatula SUNN, another GmNARK orthologue, using bioinformatics and computational approaches indicated several highly conserved motifs including a putative negative regulatory region (NRR), which was previously reported to repress gene expression in non-phloem cell types. Deletion analysis of the GmNARK promoter, however, ruled out the possibility that this motif, found at -308 bp with respect to the translation start site, was truly functional and located the region controlling phloem-specific expression to DNA sequence between 908 bp and 1.7 kb upstream of the start codon. Two other candidate regions were identified by Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME). These regions, namely MEME3 and MEME4 showed strong sequence similarity to the corresponding regions of the LjHAR1 promoter. Interestingly, the MEME3 motif was also found in the MtSUNN promoter at a similar location to that of LjHAR1. Potential NRRs in the LjHAR1 and MtSUNN promoters were found in the MEME3 motifs, whereas only a variant form of a NRR in the GmNARK promoter was found in this region. Additionally, an identical semi-palindromic sequence was also observed in the MEME3 motifs of the three orthologous promoters. Based on these findings, the semi-palindromic sequence and the variant form of the NRR are proposed to be positive and negative regulatory elements for the phloem-specific expression of GmNARK, respectively. The computational approaches also identified two potential TATA elements in the GmNARK promoter. Rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends and promoter deletion analysis have confirmed that they were functional. The two TATA elements in GmNARK promoter appeared to cooperatively direct transcription of GmNARK, but either was adequate for basal transcription. The finding that the expression of AON receptor-like kinase genes is phloem-specific has contributed to a better understanding of AON signalling pathways. The QRT-PCR study and the discovery of cis-acting regulatory regions have also provided crucial information on the transcriptional regulation of GmNARK as well as plant genes in general. Additionally, the promoters of GmNARK and LjHAR1 could potentially be used to drive phloem-specific expression in legume biotechnology research.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300203 Plant Improvement (Selection, Breeding and Genetic Engineering)</field><field name="subject">legumes</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of hnRNPs A/B in cancer cells and their roles in carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">He, Yaowu</field><field name="description">The identification of specific and reproducible biomarkers is critical for the early diagnosis of cancer, which has a profound effect the survival rate of patients. Comprehensive laboratory and clinical evidence needs to be collected to confirm the accuracy of the biomarkers prior to their clinical use. Heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and B1 have been suggested as biomarkers for cancer since 1988 when hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression was first linked with the occurrence of lung cancer. Later studies established a correlation between the expression levels of these hnRNPs and other cancers, such as breast, pancreatic, and lymphatic tumours. In this study, the expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, A3, and B1 has been investigated in various cancer cell lines. hnRNPs A1 and A3, in addition to A2 and B1, were found to be overexpressed in some cancer types. However, the overexpression of none of the hnRNP A/B proteins was universal, and their upregulation may be limited to a few cell types, suggesting they may be effective biomarkers for a subset of cancers. The upregulation of hnRNP A/B proteins in tumours and cancer cell lines led to the hypothesis that they are involved in the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer. According to our Western blot analysis, expression of the hnRNP proteins, A1, A2, and B1, is dependent on the cell cycle whereas no significant change was detected for hnRNP A3, implying that the former three are needed during certain cell cycle stages. The results, together with the transcription factor analysis of the promoter regions of the HNRPA1, HNRPA2, and HNRPA3 genes, suggest that hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 may have distinct regulatory machineries and cellular functions although they have high amino acid sequence identity. However, their mRNA levels were unchanged across the cell cycle, suggesting the cell-cycle-dependent expression of hnRNPs A1, A2, and B1 is modulated at the translational level. Previous studies showed higher expression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 in rapidly proliferating cells than in quiescent cells, suggesting a role of these proteins in cell proliferation. Though interruption of hnRNP A1 expression did not result in significant change in the viability of murine CB3 cells, simultaneous suppression of hnRNPs A1 and A2 caused apoptosis in a few cell lines. Consistent with this, suppression of hnRNP A1 or A3 expression in our study in Colo16 squamous cells using RNA interference did not affect cell proliferation, but simultaneous suppression of both caused slow cell proliferation. By contrast, reduction of the hnRNP A2 level alone slowed the proliferation of Colo16 cells. These results suggest that although hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3 share some roles in cell proliferation, each of them may have distinct tasks. This conclusion is supported by the data from the comparative analysis of the downstream targets of hnRNPs A1, A2, and A3, which has shown that these three proteins share a limited number of common downstream proteins. The observed impact on cell proliferation of suppressing hnRNP A2 subfamily proteins is in accord with our finding that the downstream targets of hnRNP A2 are overrepresented by genes involved in proliferation regulation, as shown in microarray and real-time PCR analysis. These include cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p21 and p27, and their regulatory proteins, such as Skp2 and Rpn10. Skp2 controls the ubiquitination of p21 and p27, and Rpn10 links them to the 26S proteasome, the complex that degrades these two CDK inhibitors. hnRNP A2 also regulates the transcription of securin and separin, which are essential for sister chromatid separation during late anaphase. In addition, hnRNP A2 can also influence cell proliferation through cell growth factors, including fibroblast, vascular endothelial, transforming, and insulin growth factors. Our gene array and real-time PCR analysis have shown that hnRNP A2 regulates the expression of these factors, their receptors, or associated proteins such as IGFBP7 and TGFBR2. The data presented in this thesis link the overexpression of hnRNP A/B proteins, in particular the A2/B1 subfamily, in cancer with their regulatory roles in cell division and cell proliferation. Our findings provide mechanistic evidence that these proteins may be a driving force for the uncontrolled cell growth in cancer, suggesting that some of hnRNP A/B proteins may be potential therapeutic targets for cancer. However, further studies are needed to obtain a global view of the roles of these proteins in cancer.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270201 Gene Expression</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of motivation through repertoire in intermediate cello students</field><field name="creator">Berry, Anne Irma</field><field name="description">The decision to research motivation through repertoire in intermediate cellists arose from two different perceived areas of need. Firstly, it was found that there was a scarcity of availability and accessibility of Australian compositions for intermediate cellists. Secondly, the literature suggested that there was a need for the further research of intrinsic motivation in the field of instrumental pedagogy. A review of the literature found that research into intrinsic motivation in instrumental pedagogy was mostly related to the 'process' of developing and maintaining motivation. Of the research which examined the aspect of 'content' in the maintenance of intrinsic motivation, this was mostly related to 'student choice'. This study emerged as a way of providing information to composers and teachers about what aspects of repertoire may be motivational. It investigates intrinsic motivation by questioning students and their teachers about which aspects of music repertoire are most likely to inspire students to practice more and strive for excellence. A discussion of the philosophies of Bruner and Csikszentmihalyi is included to give meaning and context to 'intrinsic motivation' in instrumental pedagogy. Research was conducted through purpose-designed questionnaires distributed to cello teachers and their students in Queensland. Questionnaires for teachers and students were very similar although the student questionnaire was a little shorter. The questionnaires gathered information on the most frequently used general teaching repertoire, as well as teachers&#146; experiences in teaching contemporary and Australian repertoire. Musical aspects investigated included style, emotional content, harmony, articulation, tempo (speed), tonality, and rhythm as well as cellistic techniques. This information was balanced with questions regarding the technical developmental requirements perceived necessary for intermediate students. In comparison with other motivators such as verbal encouragement, ensemble participation and preparation for performances and exams, repertoire was found to be a significant motivator for 'students' best work'. Students' preference for challenging music, or by contrast, beautiful music was a persistent theme throughout the results. The three characteristics which were nominated as most motivating by both teachers and students were fast and lively, from the Romantic period and for cello and piano. The strongest difference between results for teachers and students was on the characteristic of folk feel which produced opposite results for the two groups of respondents. Some differences were also found within the respondent groups on the basis of gender and age. It is noted that students acknowledged the benefits of learning more advanced aspects of technique, such as thumb position, in expanding the pool of repertoire which they would be able to play. It was confirmed that Australian repertoire was not often taught to students at this level and that this was, at least in part, because of a lack of availability. Suggestions have been made for both composers and teachers in choosing techniques and repertoire for intermediate students. However, the importance of asking students about their preferences is borne out by the volume and detail of students' individual responses. Also, by questioning their students, teachers are likely to be stimulating the valued development of 'metacognitive strategies' in adolescent students.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">410101 Music</field><field name="subject">750201 The performing arts (incl. music, theatre and dance)</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective transport of attached particles across the froth phase</field><field name="creator">Seaman, David Richard</field><field name="description">Over many years, researchers in the field of flotation have developed an in-depth understanding of processes occurring in the pulp phase of flotation machines. Until recently, however, the froth phase has received little attention. The froth phase serves to separate bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry in a flotation cell. The mechanism of recovery by entrainment, its relationship to water recovery and particle size dependency is well understood. Froth recovery, (the fraction of particles entering the concentrate launder that entered the froth phase attached to air bubbles), is not well understood. Up until now, there has been doubt over whether this property is dependent on particle size and hydrophobicity. Difficulties in measuring froth recovery had previously prevented researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the transport of attached particles across the froth phase. A novel device was designed and tested to measure froth recovery by isolating bubble-particle aggregates in the pulp-phase of flotation machines through the determination of the bubble loading in the pulp phase (mass of particles attached per unit volume of air bubbles). This technique can be used with other measurements to investigate froth selectivity by directly comparing these captured particles to those found in the froth phase. Evidence was collected at Red Dog Mine, Alaska and Newmont Golden Grove Operations, Western Australia which showed that the froth phase selectively transported more hydrophobic and smaller sized particles across the froth than less hydrophobic and larger particles. Particles collected in the device were compared to those found in the concentrate stream on a size by mineral by liberation class. Froth recovery was also calculated on a size by mineral by liberation class for two valuable sulphide minerals in a continuous 3m&#179; flotation cell. These results show that the froth phase is responsible for the upgrading of attached particles across the froth phase as well as for the separation of bubble-particle aggregates from suspended slurry. The pulp phase is responsible for creating bubble-particle aggregates through the attachment of hdyrophobic mineral particles to air bubbles. Many complex factors affect the extent to which this occurs including the size and hdyrophobicity of the particles, the size and number of air bubbles produced by the flotation machine, the rate of collisions between particles and bubbles and the overall chemistry of the system. This measurement of bubble loading presents an opportunity to measure the impact of all these factors on the successful creation of bubble-particle aggregates. Based on a literature review suggesting that there was a high probability of particles being detached at the pulp-froth interface due to the aggregates change in momentum, a three phase description of a flotation cell was proposed. The three phases were: pulp, pulp-froth interface and upper froth zones. A second froth recovery measurement technique (changing froth depth) was used in combination with the bubble load technique to determine the recovery across each of the two froth zones. It was found that the pulp-froth interface appears to be responsible for the selectivity observed across the froth phase as a whole. These findings will enable more in-depth research into the sub-process of the froth phase as well as assisting flotation cell design through a better understanding of the roles of the pulp-froth interface and the upper froth region.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290702 Mineral Processing</field><field name="subject">640300 First Stage Treatment of Ores and Minerals</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158293</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the Edge of Their Seats: The Novel Manuscript 'Frantic', and the critical essay 'Suspense in Fiction: Its Operation and Techniques'</field><field name="creator">Howell, Katherine Leslie</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of the critical essay and the creative project. The critical essay is an investigation into the nature of narrative suspense, its operation, and the techniques by which an author can develop it. Narrative suspense requires that readers care for characters and feel uncertain about events. An author can use a number of story-telling techniques to make the most of this emotion and uncertainty. Readers may embark on a variety of activities including imagining outcomes and piecing together clues, and these too can be utilised by the author to build suspense. Following the examination of the subject, I explore the development of the drafts of Frantic with particular emphasis on how my research into suspense changed my approach to characterisation, structure, and the process of writing. The creative project is the manuscript Frantic, a crime thriller set in present-day Sydney. When Paramedic Sophie Phillips&#146; husband Chris is shot and their baby kidnapped, Detective Ella Marconi struggles to solve the case. Evidence suggests the act may be revenge by a bereaved father for Sophie&#146;s failure to save a mother and her newborn, and equally that senior constable Chris may have been involved in the police corruption that increasingly appears rife. Distraught Sophie knows what she believes, and when the police fail to find her son she takes matters into her own hands.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">400103 Professional Creative Writing</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158213</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Groundwater dynamics and the salinity structure in sandy beaches</field><field name="creator">Cartwright, Nick</field><field name="description">Groundwater dynamics in beaches have been investigated through field and laboratory experiments. The observations have been used to test the ability of currently available mathematical and numerical models to adequately account for the influence of processes such as vertical flow and capillarity. New 1D sand column experiments have been conducted to examine the influence of a truncated capillary fringe on periodic water table oscillations. As the fringe becomes increasingly truncated the aquifer storage term, the complex effective porosity n &#969;, is substantially reduced in agreement with previous findings under steady flow conditions. The findings are a useful starting point for an investigation of the dynamics of the water table exit point in beaches where the water table lies just below the sand surface. A simple 2D laboratory aquifer, influenced by finite-depth and capillarity effects, subject to simple harmonic periodic forcing has been used to investigate the dispersion of the water table waves. The performance of existing dispersion relation theories, accounting for both capillarity and finite-depth effects, deteriorates at higher oscillation frequencies suggesting that other, neglected processes have some influence. Horizontal flow in the capillary fringe is suggested as such a process. The generation of higher harmonics due to a sloping beach face is also investigated in the laboratory. The observations reveal that the generation process is strongest near the sand surface, likely to be due to vertical flows into the aquifer being strongest near the sand surface. A 2DV numerical model is applied to the data and does well in predicting the nature of the generation process, qualitatively reproducing the variation in oscillation amplitude with depth in the inter-tidal zone. Application of a modified Boussinesq equation to estimate aquifer recharge due to infiltration from wave runup is critically applied to field and laboratory measurements. Finite amounts of flux across the water table are seen at, and landward of, the runup limit where there is zero infiltration at the sand surface. This suggests that the capillary fringe and vertical flows in this region are significant and that application of the model be undertaken with care. Field observations of the salinity structure and its response to ocean forcing reveal no response to tidal forcing but a significant response to a wave-induced pulse in groundwater levels. The infiltration of salty ocean water due to infiltration from wave runup is shown to reverse the traditional &#147;salt-wedge&#148; scenario in the surficial aquifer with a thin salty layer overlying the fresh water.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">L</field><field name="subject">290801 Structural Engineering</field><field name="subject">680203 Civil</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158177</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dark husk of beauty</field><field name="creator">Leggett, Andrew Alfred George</field><field name="description">In my dissertation &#8211; a collection of poems entitled Dark Husk of Beauty &#8211; I struggle with the dualities of beauty and ugliness, of creation and destruction. This Dark Husk of Beauty is what remains when I follow the exhortation of John Scott&#8217;s magician Aosman to take the ugly, or the deformed, or the old, and transcend &#8230; natural revulsion by uniting with it aesthetically &#8211; sometimes even physically. The body, subject to such a union, becomes the central metaphor of this creative work. The poems in the title section address the fierce disintegrative beauty of the body subject to the ravages of passion, disease and death. Those of the second section take up the metaphor of &#8220;Prophecy&#8221; &#8211; Ezekial&#146;s prophecy over the plain of dry bones that, gathered together, grow flesh and are restored to life. In the third section, &#8220;Wings of Desire&#8221;, the poems defiantly transcend aesthetic dualism, undeterred by the punishments inflicted on the body for the artists&#8217; heresy. The final poem, a sequence of versions of lesser known works of Rilke, attempts to negotiate the portal separating such extremes through grace. My critical essay &#8211; A Psychoanalytic Discourse on Creation, Destruction, Perversion, Reparation and Creation in the Works of John Scott &#8211; addresses the problems of such creation by means of a psychoanalytic literary discourse. The relationship between creativity and perversion is discussed in the course of comparatively examining issues of indebtedness, desire, damage, destruction and repair in the poetry and fiction of John Scott and in my Dark Husk of Beauty.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of how John Wesley's theological methodology functions in pastoral practice, illustrated by his doctrine of Christian perfection</field><field name="creator">McEwan, David Bernard</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the theological methodology of John Wesley as he used it in pastoral practice. The study is situated primarily in the area of the history of Christian thought and is located in the area of modern Enlightenment Studies. Wesley&#146;s role as a pastoral theologian is established and his theological methodology uncovered from the perspective of his holistic vision of the God-human relationship being centred in love. This lays the foundation for an examination of his theological sources and tools derived from his extensive writings. Their interaction is explored through an examination of the doctrine and practice of Christian perfection as Wesley offered pastoral guidance to the people called Methodists. There is extensive debate within Methodist circles (particularly in North America) regarding the conception and utility of Wesley&#146;s theological method. Albert C. Outler was the key scholar who identified the components of the Wesleyan quadrilateral (Scripture, reason, tradition and experience) and proposed it as a unique and fruitful conception, with invaluable application for the Methodist movement today. Outler&#146;s claims have been much debated and in many quarters rejected, though his basic understanding remains well-established within influential sections of the church. This thesis is an examination of Wesley&#146;s writings in the light of the current debate to see if a more productive model can be established that will have greater resonance in a postmodern setting. After an overview of the scholarly debate on Wesley&#146;s location and theological method in the eighteenth century, the major focus is Wesley&#146;s own extensive writings over the course of his ministry. This is examined in three periods: 1725-39, 1740-69 and 1770-91. The study seeks to discover for each period his conception of the God-human relationship and what this implies for his theological method. The sources and tools Wesley utilised are then identified, before attention is turned to an examination of Christian perfection as a doctrine and its application in pastoral practice. The study has found that the common assessment of Wesley as a pastoral theologian is correct and this has implications for his approach to theologising. Wesley viewed the core characteristic of God&#146;s nature as love and the God-human relationship is to be defined by the qualities of trust and passion, rather than an intellectual comprehension of propositional truths about God. In his theological method Scripture, reason, community ethos and Christian experience are utilised in an interconnected dynamic network, energised by the presence of the Holy Spirit. God is clearly the sole theological authority and the components of the system are the means he uses for communication. This analysis emphasises the fundamental nature of Christianity as a relationship of love, based on trust rather than an intellectual comprehension of doctrine; it is essentially a matter of the heart rather than the head. Accordingly, pastoral theology is much more important than academic, systematic theology for Christian experience and spiritual formation. Theological method must be shaped by this understanding, and so personal knowledge is always to be valued over intellectual propositions; Christian belief concerns the encounter with God as a Person rather than the mastery of a comprehensive system of doctrines. Critical to this process is the ethos of the community, which is the intimate blending of all the elements under the guidance of the Spirit. This makes Christian experience, rather than merely life experience, of vital importance. Because love and relationships are not reducible to mechanical systems that are merely intellectually comprehended, there is an element of mystery that remains. There is a difference in the way that the Spirit utilises the means when working with the doctrinal substance and the experiential circumstance of Christian perfection. The Modernist approach that is focused on dissection and analysis results in the loss of this holistic, dynamic system and its reduction to either pure subjectivism or rationalism. Wesley&#146;s theological method is much closer to the pre-Modern approach that has been prevalent for most of history and more in harmony with much of the present developments in postmodern thought.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simultaneous Lift, Moment and Thrust Measurements on a Scramjet in Hypervelocity Flow</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Matthew</field><field name="description">This study investigates the stress wave force balance technique for the measurement of forces on a fuelled hypersonic flight vehicle in an impulse-type test facility. A three component force balance for the measurement of lift, thrust and pitching moment on a supersonic combustion ramjet engine was designed, built, calibrated and tested. The force balance was designed using finite element analysis and consisted of four stress bars instrumented for the measurement of strain. Relative errors of less than 2% were obtained for the recovered simulated calibration loads, while errors of less than 3% were obtained for lift and thrust components for simulated fuel-on and fuel-off force loading distributions. Tests in a calibration rig showed that the balance was capable of recovering the magnitude of point loads to within 3% and their lines of action to within 1% of the chord of the model. Additional errors result when testing in a wind tunnel. The uncertainties for the experiments with fuel injection are estimated at 9%, 7% and 9% for the coefficients of lift, thrust and pitching moment. The scramjet vehicle was 0.566m long and weighed approximately 6kg. It consisted of an inlet, combustion chamber and thrust surface. Fuel could be injected through a series of injectors located on the scramjet inlet. The scramjet model was set at zero angle of attack. Experiments were performed in the T4 Free Piston Shock Tunnel at a total enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg, a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa and a Mach number of 6.6, with equivalence ratios up to 1.4. Fuel-off force coefficients were measured to within 2% of theoretical values based on predictions using CFD and hypersonic theory. The fuel-off centre-of-pressure was measured to within 4% of the predicted value. The force coefficients varied linearly with equivalence ratio. Good comparison of the measured lift and thrust forces with theoretical values was obtained with increasing flow rates of fuel. The lift-to-drag ratio increased from 3.0 at the fuel-off condition to 17.2 at an equivalence ratio of 1.0. Poor agreement between the measured pitching moment and theoretical values was obtained due to difficulties in predicting the pressure distribution with heat addition on the latter parts of the thrust surface. A shift in the centre-of-pressure of approximately 10% of model chord was measured as the equivalence ratio varied from 0.0 to 1.0. For the design tested, the thrust produced was not enough to overcome drag on the vehicle, even at the highest equivalence ratio tested. Tests at higher stagnation enthalpies (up to 4.9MJ/kg) showed the lift and pitching moment coefficients remained constant with an equivalence ratio of 0.8 but the thrust coefficient decreased exponentially with increasing stagnation enthalpies. Good agreement of experimental values of lift and thrust force with predicted values was obtained for equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. Choking occurred at stagnation enthalpies of less than 3.0MJ/kg and a nozzle supply pressure of 32MPa with fuel injection at an equivalence ratio of approximately 0.8, resulting in a drag force of approximately 2.5 times the fuel-off drag force. Tests at a nozzle supply enthalpy of 3.3MJ/kg and nozzle supply pressures of 32, 26 and 16MPa were performed at equivalence ratios of 0.0 and 0.8. The fuel-off lift coefficient remained constant but the thrust coefficient increased. This is attributed to a reduction in skin friction associated with longer lengths of laminar boundary layers as the Reynolds number was decreased. The measured fuel-off lift and thrust coefficients agreed with the predicted values to within the known test flow and force prediction uncertainties. Combustion did not occur at a nozzle supply pressure of 16MPa. This work has demonstrated that overall scramjet vehicle performance measurements (such as lift-to-drag ratio and shifts in centre-of-pressure) can be made in a free piston shock tunnel.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">290299 Aerospace Engineering not elsewhere classified</field><field name="subject">690302 Space transport</field><field name="subject">shock tunnel</field><field name="subject">force measurement</field><field name="subject">scramjet</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158040</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In/visibility: Women looking at men's bodies in and through contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="creator">Bode, Katherine</field><field name="description">Masculinity is an increasingly prominent and important issue in debates within feminism, literary studies and visual theory. This study intervenes in and contributes to such debates by analysing an emerging group of Australian women&#146;s fictions (published between 1998 and 2002) which focus on male characters and, in particular, on the description and narrative potential of their bodies. The majority of these texts, and the ones that are explored in this thesis &#150; namely, Jillian Watkinson&#146;s The Architect, Georgia Blain&#146;s The Blind Eye, Mireille Juchau&#146;s Machines for Feeling, Fiona Capp&#146;s Last of the Sane Days, Sarah Myles&#146;s Transplanted and Wendy Scarfe&#146;s Miranda &#150; share two preoccupations. Firstly, male characters bodies&#146; are almost always damaged or suffering in some way; secondly, the ability (or inability) of female characters to look at these bodies is repeatedly foregrounded. I argue that the interactions between male characters&#146; bodies and female characters&#146; gazes function in complex ways both to confirm and to challenge patriarchal constructions of masculinity and male corporeality. Specifically, this occurs in relation to the engagement of each text with popular discourses of feminism and masculinity crisis, discourses that emerge and interact in complex and often contradictory ways in depictions of male visibility and exposure. While my approach is generally feminist, it is also fiction-centred. Thus, I draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives, including literary theory, masculinity studies, visual theory, history, sociology and philosophy, in order to unpack and engage with these contemporary Australian women&#146;s fictions. Paradoxically, one of the main consequences of this fiction-centred approach is a reengagement with and a rethinking of theoretical concepts emerging from psychoanalytic feminist film theory. In a remarkably consistent and explicitly pedagogical way, these fictions explore notions of objectification and dichotomisation, especially as they are elucidated in Laura Mulvey&#146;s analysis of Hollywood narrative cinema. Objectification is overwhelmingly aligned with oppressive power structures and identified as problematic, and the first half of this thesis explores the novels&#146; critiques of this mode of visual interaction. The second half investigates the alternatives to objectification imagined in these fictions. While, upon closer consideration, some of these alternatives recapture male and female characters within traditional patriarchal power relations, others enable a rethinking of both women&#146;s vision and desire, and men&#146;s subjectivity, visibility and desirability.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">420303 Culture, Gender, Sexuality</field><field name="subject">751001 Languages and literature</field><field name="subject">masculinity</field><field name="subject">female gaze</field><field name="subject">men's bodies</field><field name="subject">contemporary Australian women's fiction</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158036</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeny, morphology and physiology of the secondary vascular system in fishes</field><field name="creator">Skov, Peter Vilhelm</field><field name="description">Vascular casts of three chondrichthian, one dipnoan, one chondrostean and 14 teleostean species were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy in order to give a qualitative and quantitative analysis of interarterial anastomoses (iaas) that indicate the presence (or absence) of a secondary vascular system (SVS). Anastomoses were found to originate from a variety of different primary blood vessels, many of which have not been previously identified as giving rise to secondary vessels. Segmental arteries derived from the dorsal aorta and supplying body musculature were major sites of origin of the SVS, although there was considerable variation in where, in the hierarchy of arterial branching, the anastomoses occurred. The degree of investment in a SVS was species specific, with more active species having a higher degree of secondary vascularisation. This difference was quantified using an absolute count of iaas between Anguilla reinhardtii and Trachinotus baillonii. A range of general features of the SVS is also described. No evidence of iaas was found on the coeliac, mesenteric or renal circulation in any species. Evidence of interarterial anastomoses were lacking in the dipnoan (Sarcopterygii) and chondrichthyan species examined, suggesting that a SVS is restricted to actinopterygian fishes. The presence and distribution of a secondary vascular system does not appear to be exclusively linked to phylogenetic position, but rather to the physiological adaptation of the species. Histological sections of primary segmental arteries and associated interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels from the long-finned eel, Anguilla reinhardtii, were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Secondary vessels were found to originate from the primary vasculature as depressions through the tunica intima and media, from where they ran perpendicularly to the adventitial layer, before coiling extensively. From here the anastomoses travelled a relatively linear path in the outer margin of the adventitia to re-anastomose with a secondary vessel running in parallel with the primary counterpart. Secondary vessels had a structure quite similar to that of primary vessels; they were lined by endothelial cells on a continuous basement membrane, surrounded by single layer of smooth muscle cells surrounding the vessel. Smooth muscle cells were also found in the vicinity of interarterial anastomoses in the adventitia, but these were more longitudinally orientated. The presence of smooth muscle cells on all aspects of the secondary circulation suggests that this vascular system is regulated in a similar manner as the primary vascular system. Because interarterial anastomoses are structurally integrated with the primary vessel from which they originate, it was anticipated that flow through secondary vessels would to some extent be affected by an increase in primary vascular tone. Immunohistochemical studies showed that primary segmental arteries displayed moderate immunoreactivity to antibodies against 5-hydroxytryptamine and substance P, while interarterial anastomoses and secondary vessels showed dense immunoreactivity. Secondary vessels were followed to the surface of the animal through consecutive sections, where they eventually give rise to capillary beds overlying the scales. Secondary capillary beds were found to supply chloride cells in the skin, suggesting that this vascular system may be involved in cutaneous ionic exchange. Branchial vascular casts from two species of Tetraodontiformes showed that the vessels previously reported as nutrient vessels are with certainty part of the secondary vascular system. In the three-barred porcupine fish, Dicotylichthys punctulatus, interarterial anastomoses originated at high densities from efferent filamental and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they formed progressively larger secondary vessels. Small branches of this vascular system entered the filament body, where it gave rise to numerous side-vessels along the way. Large secondary vessels running in parallel with the efferent branchial arteries were found to constitute an additional arterio-arterial pathway, in that they exited the branchial basket in company with the afferent mandibular artery, the carotid artery and the efferent branchial arteries, from where they gave rise to vascular beds immediately after exit. The secondary vessels in this species were not found to supply the filament musculature; rather this vascular system was supplied by a single vessel derived from the efferent branchial artery, running in parallel with the afferent branchial artery. Secondary vessels were not found on any branchial component in the banded toadfish, Marylina pleurosticta, but in all other aspects the branchial vascular anatomy was similar to that of D. punctulatus. It is proposed that four independent vascular pathways may be present in the teleostean gill. The blood volume and flow rates of the primary (PVS) and secondary vascular system (SVS) were examined in the catadromous euryhaline teleost Lates calcarifer in order to determine whether any of these parameters were subject to change in individuals acclimated to seawater, compared to a group acclimated to freshwater. There was no significant difference in any measured parameter for the two groups. The volumes of the SVS were 0.67 &#132;b 0.13 and 0.76 &#132;b 0.13 mL 100g-1 body mass for FW and SW acclimated animals respectively. This constituted approximately one-third of the total blood volume in both groups. Turnover times for the SVS ranged from 21.0 to 25.2 minutes, demonstrating in accordance with previous publications, that this system is considerably more dynamic than previously assumed.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270604 Comparative Physiology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">secondary vessels</field><field name="subject">anatomy</field><field name="subject">control</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">immunohistochemistry</field><field name="subject">histology</field><field name="subject">blood vessels</field><field name="subject">primary</field><field name="subject">secondary</field><field name="subject">volume</field><field name="subject">flow</field><field name="subject">chondrichthyes</field><field name="subject">dipnoi</field><field name="subject">actinopterygii</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Limitations to plant root growth in highly saline and alkaline bauxite residue</field><field name="creator">Kopittke, Peter Martin</field><field name="description">Revegetation of bauxite residue is hampered by a lack of understanding of the limitations imposed on plant growth in highly saline and alkaline growth mediums. In this study, several of these growth limiting factors were investigated. The toxicity of the hydroxyl ion (OH-) was examined using a solution culture system developed to allow studies at high pH without nutritional limitations. Also using this solution culture system, the effect of the high Na and Mg concentrations of bauxite residue on the Ca nutrition of plants was investigated. As the toxicity of Al at high pH is not known, a study was conducted to examine the rhizotoxicity of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and polycationic Al at high pH. The ability of plant roots to reduce rhizosphere pH in bauxite residue was also considered. A novel gypsum application method was assessed for its efficiency at improving the Ca status of bauxite residue. Manual adjustment, ion exchange resins and automated titration were examined for their suitability for nutrient solution pH control in alkaline conditions. For short-term studies, it was found that a solution without supply of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, and aerated with CO2 depleted air, greatly reduced nutrient precipitation at high pH, thus eliminating nutritional differences between treatments. Manual pH adjustment and the use of ion exchange resins as pH buffers were unsuitable methods of pH control. In contrast, pH control by automated titration had little effect on solution composition while maintaining constant pH. The solution culture system was used to examine OH- toxicity in mungbeans (Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek cv. Emerald), with root length reduced at a bulk solution pH of 8.5 and greater. The effect of Ca activity ratio (CAR) and pH on Ca uptake by mungbeans and Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana cv. Pioneer) in Na dominated solution cultures and in soil was investigated. Changes in pH in the alkaline range were shown to have no effect on the critical CAR of 0.024 (corresponding to 90 % relative root length) for mungbeans grown in solution culture. Results from soil grown mungbeans confirmed those from solution culture, with a critical CAR of 0.025. A critical CAR of 0.034 was also established for soil grown Rhodes grass. However, using dilute nutrient solutions dominated by Mg at pH 9.0, root growth was found to be more limited than had been observed for Na solutions, with growth reduced beneath a critical CAR of 0.050. Using a CAR equation modified with plasma membrane binding constants (to incorporate the differing antagonistic effects of Mg and Na), new critical CAR values were calculated for Na (0.56) and Mg (0.44) dominated solutions. This modified CAR equation permits the calculation of CAR irrespective of the dominant salt present. Solubilities of various gypsum sources and size fractions in seawater were studied to investigate the effectiveness of gypsum addition to the residue sand pipeline, rather than as a direct field application. The dissolution rate constant varied with gypsum source (analytical grade (AR) &gt; phosphogypsum (PG) &gt; mined gypsum (MG)) due to reactivity and surface area differences, generally reaching saturation within 15 s (AR) to 30 min (MG &gt; 2.0). The ability of bauxite residue to remove Ca from solution (due to cation exchange and precipitation) was also examined; the quantity of the total solution Ca adsorbed was found to be small (5 %). These low rates of solution Ca adsorption, comparatively rapid dissolution rates, and long pumping times (20 min), preclude the application of gypsum to the residue sand/seawater slurry as a method for residue amelioration. Dilute, alkaline (pH 9.5) nutrient solutions were used to investigate the effects of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) on mungbean root growth. Although root growth in Al(OH)4- solutions was slightly limited, the symptoms associated with this growth reduction were observed to be similar to those caused by the Al13 polycation at concentrations lower than that which can be detected. Also, when roots displaying these symptoms were transferred to fresh Al(OH)4- solutions, no root tip lesions were observed, and root hair growth on the lateral roots improved. Thus, Al(OH)4- is considered to be non-toxic, with the observed reduction in root growth in solutions containing Al(OH)4- due to the gradual formation of toxic Al13 in the bulk nutrient solution resulting from the acidification of the alkaline nutrient solution by the plant roots. The effect of Mn deficiency in Rhodes grass and of legume inoculation in lucerne (Medicago sativa L. cv. Hunter River), on the rhizosphere pH of plants grown in highly alkaline bauxite residue was investigated. In response to Mn deficiency in residue sand, Rhodes grass was observed to increase acidification of its rhizosphere (being up to 1.22 pH units lower than the bulk soil). Due to its ability to fix atmospheric N2 rather than relying on soil N (NO3-) reserves, inoculated lucerne (1.75 pH unit decrease) was also found to acidify its rhizosphere to a greater extent than non-inoculated lucerne (1.16 pH unit decrease).</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300804 Environmental Impact Assessment</field><field name="subject">770806 Remnant vegetation and protected conservation areas</field><field name="subject">Aluminate toxicity</field><field name="subject">alkalinity</field><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">rhizosphere pH</field><field name="subject">gypsum dissolution</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anterior-Posterior Ground Reaction Force Characteristics for Post-Block Foot Contacts in Sprint Running</field><field name="creator">Watts, Mark Charles</field><field name="description">Past research on the acceleration phase in sprint running has concentrated on the kinematics of sprint blocks set-up and the initial steps after exiting the sprint blocks. In contrast, there has been limited research on the ground reaction forces (GRF) generated during the initial post-block foot contacts. These initial foot contacts in sprinting are important for optimising performance in the initial acceleration phase of sprinting. However, little is known about the GRF elite sprinters generate during the initial foot contacts and how these GRF characteristics relate to performance. It is the anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF that are of most importance as they indicate the sprinter&#146;s motion from the start to the finish line. This thesis investigates the A-P GRF of the first two foot contacts of the sprint start after leaving the blocks. The participants included seventeen male and six female sprinters with a mean age of 22.6 (SD 4.4 years). Seventeen of the sprinters had competed at international/national level competitions and six at recreational/amateur level competitions. The athletes were classified as senior male elite (SME), senior female elite (SFE), junior male elite (JME) and senior male recreational (SMR). The sprinters were instructed to perform block starts at maximal effort to produce the fastest time over 5 metres on a 30 metre indoor laboratory track. Timing gates were used to record 5 metre times and two strain gauge force plates were placed in series to collect GRF data from the first two foot contacts after leaving the starting blocks. From the GRF data, braking time, maximum A-P braking force, A-P braking impulse, propulsive time, maximum A-P propulsive force, A-P propulsive impulse and A-P contact impulse were determined for each trial. The A-P propulsive phase constituted greater than 90% of the total contact time, had approximately twice the magnitude of the maximum force of the braking phase and accounted for more than 95% of the total contact impulse across the four groups of sprinters. The SME group produced a significantly larger A-P propulsive impulse on the first and second steps compared to the SFE (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively), JME (not significant and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The SME group&#146;s maximum A-P propulsive force was significantly larger on the first and second steps than the SFE (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively), JME (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The SME group&#146;s propulsive time on the first and second steps was not significantly different compared to the SFE (both not significant) but was significantly shorter compared to the JME (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) and SMR (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05 respectively) groups. The maximum A-P propulsive force correlated strongly with 5 metre time for the first step (rs = -0.670, p less than 0.01), second step (rs = -0.621, p less than 0.01) and the addition of the first and second steps (rs = -0.678, p less than 0.01) across all the sprinters. Whereas, the A-P propulsive impulse correlated strongly with 5 metre time for the first step (rs = -0.525, p less than 0.01), second step (rs = -0.592, p less than 0.01) and the addition of the first and second steps (rs = -0.584, p less than 0.01). Three A-P GRF patterns were observed during the first and second foot contacts of the sprinters examined in this study. A braking-propulsive (B-P) pattern was the most frequently observed followed by a propulsive-braking-propulsive (P-B-P) and a no braking (NB) pattern 82.7%, 15.4% and 1.9% respectively. The P-B-P and NB patterns, which have not been described previously, appeared most frequently in the least experienced sprinters. In the past, some sprinters and their coaches have tried to minimise the braking phase and maximise the propulsive phase of the first two foot contacts after exiting the blocks during sprinting. This study suggests that increasing the maximum propulsive force is the best way to increase performance over the first 5 metres of the acceleration phase. The research also suggests that there will be little benefit gained from trying to increase performance by focusing on the braking phase during these first two steps after exiting the blocks. As such, sprinters and coaches should focus their attention primarily on producing a large A-P propulsive force during the first two steps of a sprint.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321405 Sports Medicine</field><field name="subject">750203 Organised sports</field><field name="subject">running</field><field name="subject">sprint</field><field name="subject">post-block</field><field name="subject">foot contacts</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157980</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Complexity approach to national IT policy making: The case of Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)</field><field name="creator">Abdul Wahab, Amirudin</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT This dissertation examines the design and implementation of Malaysia's national Information Technology (IT) policy with a focus on the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) project. Qualitative research methods, including in-depth interviews, document analysis and literature analysis, were used to build an understanding of the development of the MSC. The analysis adopts a holistic approach that draws upon the multidisciplinary perspectives of complex adaptive systems in order to understand how social, economic, political and institutional forces interact in a changing environment. This research contributes a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and methods. It is one of the first public studies of the MSC and one of very few complex systems analyses of a socio-economic system in a developing country. It has been argued that many countries around the world are competing rapidly to produce 'visionary' reports and policy statements on the future of their nations and societies in the 'Information Age'. This is due to the belief that IT can play critical role in stimulating the socio-economic growth of the countries. In Malaysia, the government embarked on an ambitious program to establish the MSC as an attempt to achieve Vision 2020, a national vision and Malaysia's statement of national goals that articulates the country's objective for developed-nation status, while moving towards the creation of an information-rich society by the year 2020. Despite the importance of national IT policies and the major commitment of resources to implement them, there are few critical studies of the positive and negative impacts of 'post-industrial' or 'information society' policy, particularly in the developing countries like Malaysia. This study seeks in part to fill this gap by providing a critical assessment of a Malaysian national IT policy. This research argues that IT policy for national development must be viewed holistically, taking into consideration innovations needed in the social, economic, political and institutional spheres, rather than taking limited view of IT as an economic growth engine. This is a paradigm shift that represents a movement from the traditional worldview (TWV), that was based on the Cartesian/Newtonian paradigm into new ways of thinking and action that is labelled here as the emerging worldview (EMV). The EMV is grounded in complexity theory, an interdisciplinary endeavour that draws upon ideas from a number of fields and seeks to understand and model systems with many interacting parts. This approach can help policy makers and analysts to understand, assess and develop a more balanced and comprehensive policy for the evolution of new technology such as IT and to tackle the complexity of socio-economic change of a dynamic real world setting. The data collection method is from in-depth, open-ended interviews and document analysis. This qualitative exploratory approach was chosen to understand and capture the points of view of other people without specifically limiting the lines of inquiry through questionnaires etc. This research was influenced by multiple theoretical frameworks, because taking one framework alone in analysing the complex issues involved in ICT would not provide a comprehensive understanding of the interplay of the socio-technical and techno-economic paradigms. This resulted in the contribution of a policy framework called Goal-Policy-Implementation-Outcome (GPIO), which is used to understand, describe and assess the MSC policy design and method. This research found that the MSC policy plan and process were not working as intended to achieve the goals of Vision 2020. The strategy of clustering businesses in one physical location to establish synergy did not work as anticipated because: (1) Cyberjaya was not yet fully ready with all the necessary people, infrastructure and community since many basic amenities have yet to be competed; (2) The distance of Cyberjaya to key cities were perceived to be too far; (3) Operational costs in Cyberjaya were perceived as high; (4) The Cyberjaya ecosystem lacks attractive incentives; and (5) Most of the current and potential MSC firms, customers and suppliers were already located outside Cyberjaya with existing networks of people and facilities in other locations. (6) The current environment of the MSC was also found not to be conducive to facilitating a self-organizing system due to the lack of a wide consultative and participatory process. Consequently, drastic changes to the organizational structure and behaviour are needed before success can happen. It was found that the key challenges and barriers to the transformation process in and through the MSC lie in the nature of the existing mindset, the operational practice, culture and power structural arrangements within and among the policy, people and institutions of the MSC. Discussion on the MSC tends to be centred on the technological and commercial without recognizing that technological change relies on concomitant social and political shifts. By succumbing to technology driven views and 'information society' rhetoric, policy makers are allowing real economic and social choices to be smothered. This dissertation argues that instead of presenting technology as something which is external to the society, with a dynamics of its own, and to which society must learn to adapt, effective debate about new technology must acknowledge the related political choices, power relationships and value judgments about the shape and direction of the society using the technology. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop policies to ensure that the economic benefits and social engineering associated with Malaysia&#146;s knowledge economy are managed through participatory and partnership methods at all levels of the country. This research has shown that complex systems analysis can lay the groundwork for a new approach that more accurately represents societal choices and outcomes than past approaches. Few researchers have undertaken complex systems analyses of social systems, with still fewer examining the context of a national public IT policy in a developing country like Malaysia. Further, there are very few thorough public studies done of the MSC itself, with most studies on the MSC either being done in confidence and/or being conducted by foreign consultants appointed by the government or by the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC). As such, public accessibility to critical studies on the MSC or public documents on them is rarely available. This research, if not the first, is one of the first attempts made to provide a thorough constructive critical study on the MSC policy project since its official launch in 1996. It is also, if not the first, one of the first attempts made to apply the emerging paradigm or the new science of complexity in a real world national policy case study, specifically the MSC policy project. Moreover, there is a huge lacking of research done on behalf of 'marginalized communities'. This research is not carried out on behalf of private enterprise or national governments but rather it is done on behalf of its citizens.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">360203 Research, Science and Technology Policy</field><field name="subject">729901 Technological and organisational innovation</field><field name="subject">Multimedia Super Corridor</field><field name="subject">MSC</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="subject">Complexity</field><field name="subject">IT Policy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Late Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Burrow, Carole J</field><field name="description">The acanthodians were a common and widespread group of fishes throughout the world during the mid-Palaeozoic. In this study, a full-scale systematic analysis of Silurian to Middle Devonian acanthodian taxa of eastern Australia was undertaken, incorporating a review and updating of historical records and descriptions of taxa. Phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early gnathostomes are uncertain. The structure, function and modes of growth of acanthodian scales were described and investigated, and these features were used for comparisons between different taxa within the group, and between acanthodians and other early vertebrates. Histological and morphological characters of the scales were incorporated in a cladistic analysis of genera erected for articulated fish. This analysis did not support the traditional ordinal level groups, the Climatiida, Ischnacanthida and Acanthodida. Therefore, the highest taxonomic level used in the study was the family. Rarely were acanthodians preserved as articulated fossils. The only examples known from the Silurian-Middle Devonian of Australia are one specimen of the putative acanthodian Yealepis douglasi Burrow &amp; Young 1999 from the Ludlow of Victoria, five specimens of an indeterminate ?ischnacanthidid from the late Givetian of New South Wales and a rich assemblage from the Givetian lacustrine shales of Mt Howitt, Victoria. The latter fauna (originally dated as Late Devonian) includes six incomplete specimens of the culmacanthidid Culmacanthus stewarti Long 1983 and about 60 specimens of acanthodidid Howittacanthus kentoni Long 1986. In contrast, disassociated remains of the group are ubiquitous in microvertebrate faunas from the mid-Palaeozoic of eastern Australia. Although scales of other fish groups are sometimes more common in particular facies, acanthodian elements are found in all depositional environments, from deep shelf marine to transitional to freshwater. Most of the taxa, particularly those only preserved as isolated scales, had not been systematically described by other workers. This thesis incorporates descriptions of new taxa, and revision and updating of other taxa. Several overseas studies have produced biostratigraphic charts based on acanthodian scales. A similar biostratigraphic overview was undertaken based on a systematic analysis of the Early Devonian acanthodians of eastern Australia, permitting comparisons with acanthodian faunas of other regions. Acanthodian scales and fin spines are the most common elements in the few vertebrate faunas that are known from the Silurian of Australia. Diversity and geographic distribution of the acanthodian faunas peaked during the Early Devonian. This study has been hampered by the low numbers of scales in many samples, and by uncertainty over their dating (particularly for the faunas from non-limestone deposits). Nevertheless, the work shows that changes in the marine assemblages are broadly correlated with the pattern of marine transgressions and regressions. Composition of the acanthodian faunas, and their abundance relative to other vertebrates in the assemblages, depend on the depositional environment. This correlation is best illustrated in Lower Devonian deposits, in which acanthodians are the most prolific and diverse. In transitional and marginal marine deposits, thelodonts are dominant, and acanthodians a minor element of the fauna. In off-shore assemblages, acanthodians and placoderms are dominant, and thelodonts are rare or absent. Vertebrate faunas are poor in the earliest Devonian deposits, but become more common by the late Lochkovian, with near-shore assemblages characterized by Trundlelepis cervicostulata and ANostolepis@ guangxiensis, and deeper shelf assemblages by a new genus, possibly assignable to the Ischnacanthidae. The vertebrate record is sparse through the middle Pragian, though AN.@ guangxiensis is present low in the Coopers Creek Limestone (upper sulcatus-pireneae zones), being replaced by Nostolepoides platymarginata, Gomphonchus? bogongensis, and Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. (Gomphonchus) liujingensis by the kindlei Zone. Microvertebrate assemblages are more common by the late Pragian (pireneae Zone), with Radioporacanthodes sp. aff. R. liujingensis in deeper shelf deposits, and N. platymarginata and G.? bogongensis dominating near-shore assemblages. The earliest Emsian (dehiscens Zone) is marked by the incoming Cheiracanthoides wangi. Middle Emsian (perbonus-serotinus zones) assemblages are characterized by two new species, possibly assignable to Gomphonchus.The Middle Devonian cosmopolitan association of Cheiracanthoides comptus and AAcanthoides@ dublinensis, which characterizes early Middle Devonian faunas from North America, Europe and China, appears first in the latest Emsian at the serotinus-patulus zone boundary. As well as showing the value of acanthodians in biostratigraphy and as indicators of environmental settings, their use in biogeography was demonstrated. Although many of the acanthodian taxa are endemic, several are also found in other regions. The Silurian to earliest Devonian faunas of eastern Australia are most closely related to coeval Chinese assemblages. Several latest Silurian-earliest Devonian taxa are also recorded from the circum-Arctic region. The late Lochkovian to early Emsian assemblages, particularly from south-eastern Australia, have many taxa in common with Chinese faunas. The mid-Emsian taxa show highest endemicity; and the latest Emsian-Eifelian assemblages have the most cosmopolitan aspect. Acanthodian faunas become rarer and depauperate in the Middle Devonian, particularly in the south-eastern corner, and are mostly in poorly dated, ?fluviatile/marginal marine deposits. This study of acanthodian faunas has encompassed a full scale systematic review of the group in this region, an appraisal of phylogenetic relationships within the group and with other early vertebrates, their palaeoecology, and their use in biostratigraphy and biogeography.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">260112 Palaeontology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="subject">Acanthodii</field><field name="subject">Devonian</field><field name="subject">Silurian</field><field name="subject">bistratigraphy</field><field name="subject">biogeography</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vaccine-adjuvant-carrier design against group A streptococcus and human papillomavirus type-16 infection</field><field name="creator">Moyle, Peter Michael</field><field name="description">Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective public health interventions, with a plethora of vaccines marketed for disease prevention. Most vaccines require parenteral administration, potentially reducing patient compliance due to injection associated pain, as well as requiring administration by trained medical staff. The capacity to deliver vaccines via a mucosal route (e.g. via the nose or mouth) has therefore been subject to a large amount of research. Despite this interest, few mucosal vaccine candidates have successfully progressed to human clinical trials. The attachment of synthetic or bacterial lipids to peptide antigens has been shown to effectively increase the immune response to poorly immunogenic peptide antigens administered via parenteral or mucosal routes. Human clinical trials of lipopeptide vaccines suggest that they in general have a good safety profile, with few or no side effects reported. The lipid core peptide (LCP) system is a lipopeptide vaccine delivery system that incorporates a lipidic adjuvant, carrier, and peptide epitopes into a single molecular entity. The LCPsystem has been demonstrated to adjuvant peptide epitopes from several group A streptococcal (GAS) strains. Antibodies elicited following immunisation with these LCPsystems may potentially protect against challenge with homologous GAS strains. Despite this encouraging data, the LCP-system suffers the inability to be thoroughly characterised, or purified to homogeneity, thus limiting its capacity to be examined in human clinical trials. The ultimate aim of this research is to develop a human-compatible mucosal LCP-based GAS vaccine. The aim of this research was therefore to develop methods for the synthesis of readily characterisable, highly pure LCP-analogues, in decent yield. Techniques that were examined, both in solution and on a solid support, included native chemical ligation and fragment condensation. Both of these techniques suffered from solubility problems. For native chemical ligation, the addition of organic solvents to the ligation mixture helped solubilise species containing the LCP lipid adjuvant, although successful ligation was not observed. The addition of 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) to the ligation mixture however was capable of solubilising lipidic species and enabled successful ligation. The thesis describes the use of this technique for the synthesis of two tri-epitopic GAS LCP-analogues, and a monoepitopic, tetra-valent GAS LCP-system, with the two tri-epitopic LCP-analogues assessed for their capacity to elicit systemic antigen-specific IgG antibodies. Overall, the thesis describes the development of a successful technique for synthesising highly pure, multi-epitopic lipopeptide vaccines for possible use in human clinical trials. In addition, the developed technique should be applicable for the synthesis of lipopeptide vaccines targeting other microorganisms, particularly where a multi-epitopic vaccine approach is warranted. While many studies have examined the LCP-systems capacity to elicit antigen-specific antibodies against attached peptide epitopes, few studies have examined its ability to elicit antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs). The ability to elicit antigen-specific CTL responses is important for the development of therapeutic vaccines against viral infections and cancer. Described is the synthesis of a series of LCP-systems incorporating a human papillomavirus type-16 (HPV-16) peptide antigen [HPV-16 E7(44-62)], containing a CTL, Bcell, and T-helper epitope. The vaccines were synthesised in order to investigate their capability to be used for the prevention and/or treatment of HPV-16 associated cervical cancer. Four mannose residues, both in O-acetylated and de-O-acetylated form, were attached to the vaccines to investigate the effect of potential dendritic cell mannose receptor targeting. The vaccines were assessed using a murine HPV-16 tumour model (TC-1 cells). This model demonstrated the capacity of the HPV-16 LCP-systems to reduce or eradicate TC-1 tumours when administered prior to tumour challenge (prophylactic), with mannose containing vaccines exhibiting greater efficacy. Overall, this study suggested that HPV-16 E7(44-62) LCP-systems had the capacity to elicit antigen-specific CTLs capable of clearing HPV-16 associated tumours when administered prior to tumour development. Based on this data, further research should be conducted to examine whether these vaccines are capable of eliminating or reducing the size of developed tumours, why mannose conjugation improved vaccine efficacy, and whether this was due to mannose receptor targeting.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planctomycete diversity and cell biology: perspectives from the molecular, cellular and organism levels</field><field name="creator">Butler, Margaret Kay</field><field name="description">The Planctomycetes are a deep branching phylum of the domain Bacteria that incorporate a diverse group of organisms possessing a number of unusual and distinct characteristics. These features include budding reproduction, the planctomycetecharacteristic crateriform structures on their cell surface, a cell wall that lacks peptidoglycan, internal compartmentalisation and unique molecular features of their rRNA genes. This study chose to investigate a number of aspects of planctomycete cell biology and diversity to further our knowledge of this unique group. In a study of the diversity of ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA, one molecule of relevance to cell biology and compartmentalisation in planctomycetes, RNase P RNA genes were sequenced for species from all genera of planctomycetes for which a pure culture exists. Secondary structures for RNase P RNA of these strains were deduced, taking to 26 the number of planctomycete RNase P RNA structures. Nucleotide positions were identified in which some planctomycetes possess a less common form, including one thought to be otherwise conserved within all Bacteria and Archaea. Phylogenetic analysis of RNase P RNA genes was relatively consistent with that of 16S rRNA genes with the exception that clustering of Gemmata and anammox sequences occurred, possibly due to either long-branch attraction or lateral gene transfer. Analysis of RNase P RNA secondary structures revealed unusual features of planctomycetes relative to all other bacteria, including an additional helix within the P13 helix of &#145;Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans&#146;, &#145;Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis&#146; and all Gemmata sequences. The longest P12 helix of any bacteria type A RNase P RNA was found in a Gemmatalike isolate. The short tandem repeats in P12 helices of two Gemmata-like isolates are possibly analogous to short tandem repetitive repeat sequences of some cyanobacteria RNase P RNA. In experiments using Gemmata obscuriglobus as a model for planctomycete cell biology and compartmentalisation functions, electron microscope-level in situ hybridisation (EMISH), and subsequent statistical analysis, was developed to localise 16S rRNA, 23S rRNA and RNase P RNA to particular regions within Gemmata obscuriglobus, the first instance of EMISH being applied in this way to bacteria. Statistical analysis localised 16S rRNA to both nuclear body and to riboplasm outside this region but it was absent from paryphoplasm. While co-localisation of both 16S rRNA and 23S rRNA molecules, which might indicate assembled ribosomes, was rarely observed, 23S rRNA, like 16S rRNA, was distributed in both riboplasm-containing areas of the cell. While statistical analysis revealed minor DNA within riboplasm outside the nuclear body, the majority was localised to that body. These results suggest at least some uncoupling of translation from transcription involving ribosomes in the riboplasm. RNase P RNA was localised both to the nuclear body and to the riboplasm outside this region, suggesting that pre-tRNA processing occurs both within nuclear body, where RNA transcripts are presumably generated, and outside nuclear body, separated from the origin of these transcripts. This is also consistent with the hypothesis that processed tRNA is required in the riboplasm outside the nuclear body, due to occurrence of some uncoupled translation. In research on planctomycetes not yet examined with respect to cell plan or structure, 16S rRNA gene sequencing of isolate ATCC 35122 confirmed its very close relationship to the type strain of Pirellula staleyi and its membership of the phylum Planctomycetes. Morphological characteristics, including polar crateriform structures and the occurrence of a unique internal, single membrane-bounded compartment enclosing nucleoid and ribosome-like particles, the pirellulosome, and a polar cap region, are also consistent with its membership of the planctomycetes and of genus Pirellula. Cells often displayed pointed, hump-like protrusions opposite each other on the cell, constituting prosthecae. Also re-examined using a number of methods were uncultured species Planctomyces bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis. Samples could be enriched for Pl. bekefii via either addition of ferric citrate or ampicillin. An application of a novel approach, laser microdissection and pressure catapulting, was also used physically to enrich P. bekefii rosettes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation provided the first molecular evidence of Pl. bekefii and Pl. guttaeformis as Planctomycetes. Also confirming Planctomycetes membership of Pl. bekefii was the presence of a cytoplasm divided into two regions by an intracytoplasmic membrane, consistent with membership to the genus Planctomyces. Two new planctomycete-like organisms, MBLW1 and MBLW2, were isolated in this study and possessed a Gemmata-like cell plan. 16S rRNA gene sequencing confirmed these isolates belonged to the Gemmata clade within phylum Planctomycetes, though they may comprise a separate but closely related genus. Via EMISH, both ATCC 35122 and MBLW1 were hybridised with a planctomycete-specific probe, consistent with membership to the planctomycetes. Statistical analysis showed that 16S rRNA was present in both regions of the riboplasm of MBLW1, identical to the distribution observed G. obscuriglobus. This is another example of possible uncoupled translation within a member of the planctomycetes and within organisms in the Gemmata clade of planctomycetes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270399 Microbiology not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158079</field></doc><doc><field name="title">2-Iodoxybenzoic Acid: Acidity Investigations and The Total Synthesis of 5,14-bis-epi-Spirovibsanin A</field><field name="creator">Mr Michael Gallen</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ibx, acidity, pka, oxidation, spirovibsanin a, diterpene, total synthesis, natural product, spirolactone</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Water Movement in Unsaturated Concrete: Theory, Experiments, Models</field><field name="creator">Leech, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">Prediction of contaminant transport in concrete subjected to short cyclical wetting and drying processes is integrally bound to prediction of the moisture flux. The concrete is unsaturated and the non-linear contaminant and moisture fluxes are not described by simple constant diffusion methods. This thesis presents, and partially justifies, a thermodynamic model for prediction of moisture movement in concrete, at all moisture contents commonly encountered. The wetting process is examined with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) images during a simple absorption (sorptivity) experiment. Diffusivity functions are derived via a novel analytical approach and a universal diffusivity is suggested. Water sorption and desorption isotherms are measured on large concrete samples. van Genuchten&#146;s retention function is successfully used to model the results. The unrelia-bility of the water sorption method at high moisture contents is illustrated by comparison with Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry (MIP). The BJH method is exploited to provide a methodology for estimating the water sorption isotherm from MIP. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is assessed with the water retention and NMR results. This thorough validation of the model yields a tortuosity parameter that is different to that commonly assumed. An analytical relationship between the sorptivity and the saturated permeability suggests the experimental the long-term unsaturated permeability overesti-mates the unsaturated conductivity function, and as such should be used judiciously when predicting unsaturated flow processes. Mualem&#146;s conductivity model is further exploited to provide unsaturated air and vapour functions that are experimentally justified. The thermodynamic description of water movement and the hydraulic functions that are developed in the thesis are incorporated into T r inCet , a transient heat and mass trans-fer model based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). The complex coupled behaviour of air, liquid, vapour and temperature are well handled under a variety of common cyclical boundary conditions. The thesis presents all necessary experimental results required for validation of a com-plex, but easily described, model for moisture movement. It covers disparate ground to provide a powerful numerical model of unsaturated moisture movement in concrete under short-term cyclical processes.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="subject">680299 Other</field><field name="subject">sorptivity</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">concrete</field><field name="subject">water retention</field><field name="subject">moisture</field><field name="subject">MIP</field><field name="subject">unsaturated</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="subject">numerical</field><field name="subject">FEM</field><field name="subject">water</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157970</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Models of fault-tolerant quantum computation</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Christopher Malcolm</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with certain theoretical problems that arise naturally in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Fault-tolerance can be defined as the art of building reliable devices from unreliable components, and is of particular importance for quantum computers that aim to precisely control the dynamics of extremely sensitive quantum systems. A model of quantum computation is a specification of the basic building blocks by which a quantum computation is implemented. The best known model is the quantum circuit model, where computations are implemented by means of unitary quantum gates that are applied to two-level quantum systems known as qubits. In a physical implementation of a quantum circuit, the gates and qubits will inevitably be affected by noise. Fault-tolerant quantum circuits are designed to be resilient against the effects of this noise, provided that it is not too strong. Fault-tolerance in the quantum circuit model is well developed thanks to the theory of quantum error-correcting codes. These codes allow for the correction of small numbers of errors introduced by a variety of noise processes. In a fault-tolerant quantum circuit, qubits are replaced with encoded qubits, and quantum gates with encoded gates that are immediately followed by special quantum circuits for error correction. Provided the rate at which errors occur is below a constant threshold value, the accumulation of errors can be checked so that the correct output of the computation correctly determined. The threshold acts as both a measure of how good the design of a quantum circuit is, and also as a target for experimenters aiming to implement quantum circuits. Much current research in quantum computation is aimed at designing quantum circuits that increase the noise threshold, hopefully to the point where it becomes within the reach of experimenters. A fault-tolerant encoded quantum gate must limit the propagation of errors so that the code&#146;s corrective capabilities are not overwhelmed. It is not so easy to design encoded gates that satisfy this property, and to date only a finite handful of such gates are known. In a faulttolerant quantum circuit, all quantum gates must be decomposed or compiled in terms of those that may be implemented fault-tolerantly. In the first part of this thesis, we present two results that may be applied to this problem of gate compilation. The first is a generic method based on the Solovay-Kitaev theorem that may be applied to all quantum gates, but is most effective for those that act on single qubits. We present the Solovay-Kitaev theorem in its simples known form as an algorithm, together with novel constructions that can be used to implement it. Following this we give a two specialized methods for two-qubit gate decomposition, based on the Cartan decomposition of the Lie group SU(4). The cluster-state model of computation is an alternative to the quantum circuit model, and makes use of quantum measurements and highly entangled cluster-states to implement a quantum computation. The fault-tolerant techniques developed for quantum circuits are not immediately applicable in this model, so in order for it to be a realistic candidate for performing computations we prove that such techniques are possible. In the second part of the thesis we prove that constant fault-tolerance thresholds may be achieved in the cluster-state model, and in particular in an adaption to an optical implementation. Following this we design a complete error correction scheme for optical cluster-state computation, and numerically determine the threshold of this model in the face of the dominant noise models likely to affect such an implementation.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">249999 Physical Sciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bivalves and the Bucephalidae: A parasitic system on the Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="creator">Bott, Nathan James</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine, for the first time, both the molluscan intermediate and the teleost definitive hosts of a major assemblage of trematode parasites present on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The parasite taxon was the Bucephalidae which occur in piscivorous fishes as sexually reproducing adults and in bivalves as asexually reproducing stages. The goal was to characterise the overall richness of the system and to explore patterns of host-specificity. Because of the size of this fauna it was not possible to incorporate all the taxa found in this study. This thesis reports the results of a survey of bivalves from this region, taxonomic studies on several elements of the fauna of fishes, and efforts to link life-cycles between bivalves and fishes. I surveyed 2256 bivalve individuals (47 species, 17 families) from South-east Queensland, Heron Island (southern GBR) and Lizard Island (northern GBR). Infections of trematode species from three families, Bucephalidae, Gorgoderidae and Monorchiidae, were found. Overall prevalence of infection was 2.3%. The Bucephalidae (11 species) was the most commonly found family. A single gorgoderid infection was found from a venerid, Lioconcha castrensis. This is the first report of a gorgoderid from a marine bivalve and phylogenetic analysis suggests that the species belongs to the Gorgoderinae. Monorchiids (5 species) were found from Tellinidae and Lucinidae. All infections are new host/parasite records. I deduce that this study produced lifecycle information, but no actual identifications, for 10% of the species of trematodes that infect bivalves of Queensland marine waters. Prosorhynchoides apogonis n. sp. is described from the intestine of the apogonid Cheilodipterus macrodon from the southern GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from the teleost family Apogonidae. Prosorhynchoides lamprelli n. sp. is described from the intestine of the carangid Caranx papuensis from off Lizard Island, GBR. This is the first bucephalid to be described from Caranx papuensis. A new trematode genus, Grammatorcynicola n. g. (Dolichoenterinae), and two new species, G. brayi n. sp. and G. nolani n. sp., are described from the intestines of the scombrids, Grammatorcynus bicarinatus and Gr. bilineatus respectively. Grammatorcynicola n. g. differs from other dolichoenterine genera in having a simple sucker-like rhynchus, the ovary anterior to the testes and by not having a particularly thick cirrus-sac wall. Six new species of bucephalid trematodes from the prosorhynchine bucephalid genera Prosorhynchus Odhner, 1905 and Neidhartia Nagaty, 1937 are reported from the epinepheline serranid genera Cephalopholis, Cromileptes, Epinephelus and Variola from the GBR. Two species of Prosorhynchus and one Neidhartia are reported from Epinephelus spp., P. jexi n. sp. from E. quoyanus, P. lafii n. sp. from E. fuscoguttatus, and N. epinepheli n. sp. from E. maculatus. The other species are P. robertsthomsoni n. sp. from several species of Cephalopholis, P. conorjonesi n. sp. from Cromileptes altivelis, and P. milleri n. sp. from Variola louti. I examined three species of Plectropomus (Serranidae: Epinephelinae), Pl. laevis, Pl. leopardus and Pl. maculatus from off Heron Island and Lizard Island on the GBR. Nine bucephalid species from the Prosorhynchinae were found, three species of Neidhartia and six species of Prosorhynchus. The three species of Neidhartia, N. haywardi n. sp., N. plectropomi n. sp. and N. tyleri n. sp., are readily distinguishable by morphology. Two of the six species of Prosorhynchus (P. lesteri n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp.) are easily distinguished from their other congeners by morphology but the other four species (P. adlardi n. sp., P. heronensis n. sp., P. munozae n. sp. and P. plectropomi n. sp.) are highly similar in morphology and were only distinguished convincingly by comparing their ITS2 rDNA sequences. Both P. adlardi n. sp. and P. wrightae n. sp. have also been found once in V. louti at Lizard Island. This is also the first study to identify life-cycle matches of the Bucephalidae using molecular techniques. I found two perfect life-cycle matches (identical sequences). The bivalve host of Prosorhynchoides lamprelli is a tellinid, Exotica clathrata; Rhipidocotyle sp. from the sphyraenid Sphyraena jello also has E. clathrata as its first intermediate host. Bayesian Inference Analysis shows that all seven species from bivalves that were sequenced belong to the Bucephalinae. Perhaps the most striking finding of the study was that one bivalve species, E. clathrata, was shown to harbour four separate species. Matching of ITS2 rDNA sequences between life-cycle stages is highly effective in circumstances of great richness such as the Great Barrier Reef. Based on my data collected, the total bucephalid species in the system is estimated to be 84.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300508 Parasitology</field><field name="subject">780105 Biological sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158287</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modeling unplanned landscape change: A Colombian case study</field><field name="creator">Etter, Andres</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this study is, to contribute to a broader and more comprehensive understanding of the patterns, processes and drivers of unplanned land cover change in the tropics, using Colombia as a study case. Land cover change is an important global issue because of the expanding ecological footprint of a rapidly increasing human population and per capita level of resource consumption. This has a major impact on natural ecosystems and their function at the local (hundreds of square kilometers) and global scales. The understanding of extent and rate of land cover change is an important issue confronting biodiversity conservation, land use planning, protected area management, and global climate change analysis. Tropical deforestation is the major source of global land cover change, with the highest absolute rates occurring in South America, especially in the Brazilian Amazon, where government planning is an important driver of deforestation. However, unplanned deforestation for cropping and ranching is also occurring in Colombia. This is of international concern because Colombia&#146;s diverse ecosystems support high levels of species richness and endemism. Improving the understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers ofland cover change (both deforestation and regeneration) is an important step in developing planning and conservation strategies to address this problem. I applied a spatial and temporal statistical modelling approach to predict changes in land cover in Colombia at the local (100 km2), regional (104 km2) and national (106 km2) levels, with a timeframe spanning from decades to centuries. As dependant variable data, binary forest/non-forest data are used. Explanatory variables comprise biophysical and socioeconomic data sourced from a broad range of information sources, including remotely sensed data from aerial photographs and satellite images, secondary sources of biophysical and socioeconomic data, and historical data. At the local-level, I addressed the deforestation process over the last 60 years using six case studies of 100 km2 of humid lowland forests, by applying logistic regression and spatial analysis. At the regional-level, I studied the deforestation in the Caquet&#225; colonization front of the Colombian Amazon region from 1988-2004 by applying a forest-cover zoning method and logistic regression models to predict deforestation and forest regeneration from biophysical and socio-economic explanatory variables. At the national level, I quantified and analysed patterns and drivers of land cover change over the past 500 years for key periods of Colombian history, and identified the extent and duration of impacts on broad ecosystem types. At the national and regional-levels, I also modelled current landscape transformation patterns and predicted areas at a high risk of future deforestation using a joint logistic regression and regression tree approach. I discovered that the rate of deforestation across several lowland regions of Colombia follows a simple sigmoid pattern composed of four phases of transformation: an initial phase of gradual forest loss; an intermediate phase of rapid loss; a second intermediate phase where the rate of decline slows; and a final phase where the forest loss stabilises and is balanced by forest regeneration creating a dynamic equilibrium. At the end of this final phase, the landscape is in a highly transformed state with forest cover stabilizing at 2 to 10% of the original extent and an average forest patch size of 15.4 (&#177; 9.2) ha. As a general rule, the transformed landscape will have two forest components: a stable component of remnant mature tropical forests, and a dynamic component of secondary forests of different ages that is repeatedly cleared. A second important discovery was that unplanned deforestation in the Colombian Amazon moves as a colonisation wave, extending from population centres. The rate of movement was 0.84 km.yr-1 between 1989 and 2002. The regional average annual deforestation rate was 2.6%, but varied locally between &#150;1.8% (regeneration) and 5.3%. The parallel deforestation and regeneration processes operating within the colonization front showed consistent patterns and rates directly related to the proportion of forest in the neighbourhood, with the highest rates of deforestation occurring in the areas with intermediate (40-60%) forest cover, following an overall quadratic function, and therefore confirming the sigmoid pattern across an entire colonization front. Landscapes with intermediate forest cover also have the highest density of edge habitat, with the deforestation process mimicking the spread of disease. At the national-level, the study reveals two important outcomes. First, there are significant regional differences in the spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of land cover change. The importance of such regional differences in factors explainingland cover change is highlighted by the greatest discrimination ability shown by a regional-level classification tree model. The coefficients and significance of variables in a regional logistic regression model confirmed these differences. Overall, factors related to accessibility (distance to roads and towns) had the strongest influence on the probability of deforestation. The second national-level outcome highlights the need for a longer-term historical perspective spanning centuries to understand present-day landscapes and their level of human impact. The historical analysis reveals that the main drivers of landscape change varied in the early colonial period, with cattle grazing becoming increasingly important, and finally the high impact of economic globalization in the 1990s. The historic land cover maps show the transformed areas increasing from approximately 15 million ha in 1500 to 42 million ha in 2000. Also, during this period, the transformed areas changed from predominantly cropping land uses in 1500 to predominantly (&lt; 75%) grazing in 2000. The research outcomes collectively provide an understanding of the spatial dynamics of unplannedland cover change in tropical forest landscapes, by showing how deforestation and regeneration processes vary along a transformation gradient, and linking the amount of remnant forests is related to the rate of change. The work has implications for policy and management. For example, the method of calculating the movement speed of a colonization front provides a spatially explicit prediction of threat that can be used in conservation planning. The improved understanding of the deforestation and regeneration dynamics over an entire colonization fronts permits more accurate calculation of carbon budgeting for climate change applications. I recommend that future work test of the generalities presented here in both, countries with unplanned deforestation and countries with planned land clearing, to evaluate the effects government controlled planning has on the end result of human transformed landscapes in tropical and subtropical forest regions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">270704 Landscape Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Discovery of novel downstream target genes regulated by the hedgehog pathway</field><field name="creator">Ingram, Wendy Jill</field><field name="description">Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a secreted morphogen involved in patterning a wide range of structures in the developing embryo. When cells receive the Shh signal a cascade of effects begin which in turn regulate downstream target genes. The genes controlled by Sonic hedgehog provide messages instructing cells how to differentiate or when to divide. Disruption of the hedgehog signalling cascade leads to a number of developmental disorders and plays a key role in the formation of a range of human cancers. Patched, the receptor for Shh, acts as a tumour suppressor and is mutated in naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS). NBCCS patients display a susceptibility to tumour formation, particularly for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The discovery of Patched mutations in sporadic BCCs and other tumour types further highlights the importance of this pathway to human cancer. The identification of genes regulated by hedgehog is crucial for understanding how disruption of this pathway leads to neoplastic transformation. It is assumed that the abnormal expression of such genes plays a large role in directing cells to divide at inappropriate times. Only a small number of genes controlled by Shh have been described in vertebrate tissues. In the work presented in this thesis a Sonic hedgehog responsive embryonic mouse cell line, C3H/10T1/2, was used as a model system for hedgehog target gene discovery. Known downstream target genes were profiled to determine their induction kinetics, building up a body of knowledge on the response to Shh for this cell type. During this work, it was discovered that C3H/10T1/2 cells do not become fully competent to respond to Shh stimulation until the cells reach a critical density, a factor that had to be taken into account when determining timepoints of interest for further investigation. Several techniques were employed to identify genes that show expression changes between Shh stimulated and control cells. In one of these techniques, RNA from cell cultures activated with Shh was used to interrogate cDNA microarrays, and this provided many insights into the downstream transcriptional consequences of hedgehog stimulation. Microarrays consist of thousands of spots of DNA of known sequence gridded onto glass slides. Experiments using this technology allow the expression level of thousands of genes to be measured simultaneously. Independent stimulation methods combined with northern blotting were used to investigate individual genes of interest, allowing genuine targets to be confirmed and false positives eliminated. This resulted in the identification of eleven target genes. Seven of these are induced by Sonic hedgehog (Thrombomodulin (Thbd), Glucocorticoid induced leucine zipper (Gilz), Brain factor 2 (Bf2), Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 1 (Nr4a1), Insulin-like growth factor 2 (Igf2), Peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp22), Lim and SH3 Protein 1 (Lasp1)), and four are repressed (Secreted frizzled related proteins 1 and 2 (Sfrp1 and Sfrp2), Macrophage inflammatory protein-1 gamma (Mip-1?), and Anti-mullerian hormone (Amh)). The majority of these represent novel downstream genes not previously reported as targets of Shh. The new target genes have a diverse range of functions, and include transcriptional regulators and molecules known to be involved in regulating cell growth or apoptosis. The corroboration of genes previously implicated in hedgehog signalling, along with the finding of novel targets, demonstrates both the validity and power of the C3H/10T1/2 system for Shh target gene discovery. The identification of novel Sonic hedgehog responsive genes provides candidates whose abnormal expression may be decisive in initiating tumour formation and future studies will investigate their role in development and disease. It is expected that such findings will provide vital clues to the aetiology of various human cancers, and that an understanding of their roles may ultimately provide greater opportunities in the future design of anti-tumour therapies.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">hedgehog</field><field name="subject">patched</field><field name="subject">sonic hedgehog</field><field name="subject">C3H/10T1/2</field><field name="subject">10T1/2</field><field name="subject">basal cell carcinoma</field><field name="subject">BCC</field><field name="subject">microarray</field><field name="subject">microarrays</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157937</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implications of Adult Attachment Theory for Chronic Pain</field><field name="creator">Meredith, Pamela Joy</field><field name="description">This thesis presents empirical evidence supporting the relevance of adult attachment theory in understanding the chronic pain experience. The thesis arose from the recognition that, although pain-related psychosocial variables have been used to differentiate subgroups of individuals in chronic pain, little is known about the developmental origins or cognitive, behavioural, or affective correlates of these subgroups. Attachment theory offers a development framework, which is of potential value in guiding early pain intervention and prevention efforts, as well as tailoring interventions to suit specific patient needs. In order to investigate the value of applying adult attachment theory to the chronic pain field, five central research questions were identified: 1) Does insecure attachment contribute to a more negative experience of acute pain for those not diagnosed with a chronic pain condition? That is, does the association between insecure attachment and maladaptive pain-related variables precede the onset of chronic pain)? 2) How do the subgroups of adult attachment, identified in a chronic pain sample, compare to the clusters identified by pain-related psychosocial measures in the same sample? 3) Are the documented associations between attachment and psychosocial variables (i.e., cognitive appraisals, self-efficacy, coping, social support) evident in the context of chronic pain? 4) Do attachment variables moderate the associations between these psychosocial variables and painrelated variables?, and 5) What is the association between adult attachment variables and outcomes from chronic pain rehabilitation programs? To address the first question, an experimental study was designed to explore the perceptions, emotions and coping patterns of 58 pain-free individuals exposed to an acute (coldpressor) pain experience. Findings revealed that higher levels of anxiety over relationships were associated with lower pain thresholds, more stress, depression and anxiety, diminished perceptions of control over pain, and diminished ability to decrease pain. More secure attachment, on the other hand, was associated with greater perceptions of control over pain, and lower levels of depression and catastrophizing. In order to explore research questions 2-5, data from two clinical samples were collected on the first and last days of participation in one of two chronic pain rehabilitation programs (program length varied from two to three weeks). A total of 152 participants completed questionnaires before treatment, with 100 of these participants also completing questionnaires after treatment. Participants were aged between 18 and 82 years (M = 38.8, SD = 12.4), and had been in pain for an average of 3.7 years (SD = 6.9). Approximately 41% of participants were women, and 58% were men (gender for one participant was unknown). In order to address question two regarding the similarity between adult attachment subgroups and pain clusters based on a psychosocial pain measure (Multidimensional Pain Inventory, MPI), pre-treatment data were analyzed. The clustering approach using the MPI, known as Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP), identifies three subgroups of individuals, labeled interpersonally distressed, dysfunctional, and adaptive copers. These clusters were compared with the four subgroups and two dimensions obtained with adult attachment measures. Results revealed that the interpersonally distressed MAP subgroup was associated with fearful attachment, while the dysfunctional MAP subgroup was linked with avoidant (low comfort) attachment. The comfort attachment dimension was associated with more adaptive MPI variables, while the anxious attachment dimension was linked with more maladaptive MPI variables. Consideration of research questions three to five prompted development of an integrative model, the Attachment-Diathesis Model of Chronic Pain (ADMCP), which provided a framework for exploring the psychosocial mechanisms linking attachment security with the outcome variables of perceived pain intensity, disability, and treatment outcomes. Based on predictions emerging from this model, a set of five studies explored pre-treatment associations between adult attachment variables, six psychosocial mechanisms (pain appraisal, depression, pain self-efficacy, anxiety, perceptions of social support, and coping), and outcome variables pre-treatment. One further paper was devoted to implications of adult attachment for treatment outcome. In general, findings from these studies revealed that variables representing attachment insecurity were significantly associated with more maladaptive coping, cognitive, affective and interpersonal characteristics, both before and after treatment, compared to variables reflecting secure attachment. Overall, both securely and insecurely attached individuals made progress in response to pain rehabilitation. Finally, a summary of the evidence of associations between attachment variables, psychosocial mechanisms, and treatment outcomes revealed by this research is presented, permitting discussion regarding the explanatory value of the ADMCP and clinical implications. Limitations to the present research, including family-wise error, the use of self-report measures, and the self-selecting nature of the sample, are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed. The evidence presented in this thesis advances our understanding of the developmental origins of chronic pain conditions, and provides a lens through which to view the heterogeneity of people with chronic pain. Overall, this project highlights the value of applying adult attachment principles to this field. It is anticipated that findings will assist in the development of a more differentiated range of treatment approaches for the individuals who experience chronic pain. In addition, the findings of this project may have important implications for prevention and early intervention of these conditions.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Capability-based Description and Discovery of Services</field><field name="creator">Devereux, Drew</field><field name="description">Whenever autonomous entities work together to meet each other's needs, there arises the problem of how an entity with a need can find and use entities with the capability to meet that need. This problem is seen in Web service architectures, agent systems, and data integration systems, among others. Solutions have been proposed in each of these fields, but they are all dependent on implementation and interface. Hence all are restricted to their particular field, and all require their participants to conform to certain assumptions about implementation and interface. This failure of support for service autonomy is conceptually unattractive and impractical. In this thesis we show how to describe and matchmake service capabilities and client needs in a way that is implementation and interface independent. The result is a service discovery solution that fully supports the rights of services to choose their own implementation and interface. Our representation is capable of capturing capabilities across a range of service types, from Web services to agents to data sources, while ignoring the implementation and interface details that distinguish them. Thus, our solution unifies these fields for description and discovery purposes, allowing data sources with complex language interfaces to compete against form-based Web services and frame-and-slot agents, for example. Moreover, our solution captures all of the most important aspects of capability, such as: the conceptual meaning and limitations on what a service can achieve; what requests can be expressed through a service's interface, and limitations on what attributes of information a service can return. The provision of an interface independent capability description raises the additional question of how to enable a client to invoke the service to which it has been matched, and correctly interpret the results returned; we solve this by providing an interface description that maps from client objectives onto invocations, and from returned results onto a canonical result format.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">280107 Global Information Systems</field><field name="subject">700102 Application tools and system utilities</field><field name="subject">semantic Web</field><field name="subject">capability</field><field name="subject">data integration</field><field name="subject">Web services</field><field name="subject">agents</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:157966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with autism spectrum disorder</field><field name="creator">Ashburner, Jill</field><field name="description">Many occupational therapists recommend adaptations to school tasks and classroom environments to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), on the assumption that sensory processing impacts on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes. The purpose of this study was to explore the rationale underpinning this practice. Specifically, the first aim was to determine whether or not children with ASD differ significantly from typically developing children with regard to sensory processing. The second aim was to provide descriptive information about the nature and prevalence of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD. The third aim was to explore associations between the sensory processing patterns and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in children with ASD and typically developing children. This study employed a matched case-control design. To control for differences in teaching styles, classroom environments and educational programs, two typically developing children were selected as controls from each of the classes of thirty students with ASD aged between 6 and 10 years. Twenty-eight children with ASD and fifty-one age- and gender-matched typically developing children were included in the final analysis. The children were all included in mainstream classrooms and were screened using the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test to ensure that their estimated IQ was within the average range. Sensory processing was measured using the Short Sensory Profile. Other independent variables that may have impacted on classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes included symptoms of ASD, IQ and classroom environmental factors. Symptoms of ASD were measured using the Gilliam Asperger Disorder Scale and Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. The Kaufmann Brief Intelligence Test was used as an estimate of IQ, as well as for screening purposes. The investigator recorded observations of the sensory aspects of each classroom environment, including estimates of visual clutter, crowding and background noise. The dependent variables, which included classroom emotional regulation, behaviour regulation (e.g., compliance, attention and social behaviours) and educational outcomes, were measured using two teacher questionnaires: the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form and the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form Revised &#150; Long Form. No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to IQ or age in months, suggesting that the two groups were well matched. Observations of the classroom environments revealed high levels of background noise, visual clutter and unpredictable tactile input. The majority of the typically developing children achieved scores at or near ceiling level on both the measures of classroom emotional and behavioural outcomes and sensory processing. This suggested that most of these children processed sensory input in a typical way and were coping well with the emotional, behavioural and academic demands of school. No significant relationships were found between the measures of sensory processing and classroom emotional, behavioural and educational outcomes in the typically developing children. The teachers rated the children with ASD as demonstrating significantly more difficulties with attention, emotional and behaviour regulation and social skills and significantly poorer academic performance than the controls. The Short Sensory Profile scores suggested a high prevalence of atypical sensory processing in the children with ASD. There were highly significant group differences on all of the Short Sensory Profile scores (p &gt; .001), with the exception of the Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity (p = .016). Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores: Under-responsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering accounted for 47% of the variance in academic performance as measured by the Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessment Teacher Report Form. As estimated intelligence and autistic symptoms were not predictors in this multiple regression model, these specific sensory processing difficulties appeared to contribute significantly to academic underachievement. The Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering was also associated with inattention as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Auditory Filtering and social problems as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .019). Auditory filtering difficulties therefore appeared to be highly problematic for the children with ASD and likely to be exacerbated by high levels of background noise in classrooms. Multiple regression analysis suggested that the Short Sensory Profile scores for Tactile Sensitivity and Auditory Filtering accounted for 36% of the variance in the score for Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for inattention. The Short Sensory Profile score for Tactile Sensitivity accounted for 22% of the variance in a Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form measure of the combined symptoms of ADHD (including inattention and hyperactivity). The Short Sensory Profile score: Movement Sensitivity accounted for 22% in the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form score for oppositional behaviours. An association between Short Sensory Profile Score: Tactile Sensitivity and oppositional behaviours as measured by the Conners&#146; Teacher Report Form approached significance (p = .015). As atypical sensory processing was found to be associated with difficulties in learning, attention and behaviour regulation at school, sensory processing may need to be considered in the planning of educational programs for students with ASD. The development of effective strategies to accommodate the atypical sensory processing of these students is a priority.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">321024 Rehabilitation and Therapy - Occupational and Physical</field><field name="subject">730303 Occupational, speech and physiotherapy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:158222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pedogeomorphic terrain analysis for forestland resource management: Science and practice</field><field name="creator">Thwaites, R.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis</field><field name="creator">Chan, V.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">320503 Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:107194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a conceptual framework for managing Australian tourism information: A national tourism information model</field><field name="creator">Carson, D.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">710599 Tourism not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:106032</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Environment, development and trade: The case of Shrimp farming in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Lavantucksin, V.</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">760202 Economic incentives and regulation</field><field name="subject">300803 Natural Resource Management</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Yield response of rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes to water deficit in rainfed lowlands</field><field name="creator">Pantuwan, Grienggrai</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">300205 Agronomy</field><field name="identifier">http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:105639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation and utilization of a common bean core collection</field><field name="creator">Islam, A.

Limited battery capacity of sensor nodes makes energy efficiency a major and challenge problem in wireless sensor networks. Thus, the routing protocols for wireless sensor networks must be energy efficient in order to maximise the network lifetime. In this thesis, we developed a centralised clustering, energy-efficient routing protocol for wireless sensor networks. Our protocol consists of a cluster head selection algorithm, a cluster formation scheme and a routing algorithm for the data transmission between cluster heads and the base station. The cluster head selection algorithm is performed by the base station using global information of the network. This algorithm aiming at choosing cluster heads that ensure both the intra-cluster data transmission and inter-cluster data transmission are energy-efficient. The cluster formation scheme is accomplished by exchanging messages between non-cluster-head nodes and the cluster head to ensure a balanced energy load among cluster heads. The routing algorithm is based on the optimal transmission range for the data transmission between cluster heads and the base station using multi-hop. The performance of our routing protocol is evaluated by comparing with three existing routing protocols on a simulation platform. The simulation results show that our protocol can achieve better performance in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime. Because of the centralised algorithm and multi-hop routing, there is a small communication overhead and transmission delay when using our protocol. Since our protocol can save energy and prolong network lifetime, it is well suited for applications where energy and network lifetime are the primary considerations and small overhead and time delay can be tolerated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">energy efficient; routing protocol; wireless sensor network</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/61074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of deformations in post-tensioned prestressed suspended slabs in tall buildings.</field><field name="creator">Vincent, Thomas J.</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis focuses on the accuracy of predicting deflections and cambers in partially prestressed suspended slabs. Precision in predicting this behaviour accurately is complex due to the large number of variables which affect the behaviour of suspended prestressed slabs. This level of complexity is particularly relevant for post tensioned slabs due to the numerous on site construction steps. Many of the variables are hard to determine accurately due to their tendency to be unique for each construction site. Variables such as ambient temperatures, concrete material properties, stressing times, applied loads, loading times, prop movement and humidity are all examples of these properties. Hence, when predicting the behaviour of post tensioned suspended slabs of a multi storey building there always remains a degree of uncertainty. The research presented in this thesis addresses crucial areas of this topic and ultimately aims to supply reinforced concrete designers and constructors with additional confidence when predicting this behaviour. The requirement for this project surfaced during the design stages of 151 Pirie, a multistorey building constructed in Adelaide, Australia. The design project for 151 Pirie was particularly complex due to a very ambitious construction timeline. The strict construction timeline was imposed due to the contractual agreement of early occupancy of the top three floors (of a 9 storey building). The client purchasing the top floors required functioning office space within a matter of months. This contract created a construction priority of erecting the bare structural requirements up to and including the top three floors in the shortest possible time. Fittings and services to the top three floors was then the secondary priority. Fitting and services to the lower floors (which would usually be achieved before the upper floors) would be performed at a later date. Excessive deflection limits of the slabs due to the accelerated construction were a major concern for the client. The effect on the deformation performance due to the accelerated construction was difficult to predict for the designer. Therefore, this project was born to help supply confidence to the designer and concrete supplier for this construction scenario. This research project was designed to assist in the close monitoring and recording of the construction process of 151 Pirie. Due to the nature of data collection, data from this construction site would be limited in its benefits for the current construction. However, the data obtained would be vital for future projects by providing a log of onsite slab performance data as well as explanations of delays or other general outcomes with the construction process. Therefore, the aim of this research is to present the issues that were faced, the methods used to overcome these issues as well as displaying the vast amounts of site specific data documented within this project for future reference. In this research a wide range of concrete material properties were collected and monitored closely on site as well as in the laboratory. The experimental testing created large detailed database of concrete material properties as well as other relevant factors such as surveyed deflections and construction timing. Concrete material properties were the primary focus of this research due to their direct effect on member performance. The database was sufficiently large to allow a meaningful statistical data analysis to be performed on the compressive strength (f&#8217;[subscript]c), modulus of elasticity (E[subscript]c) and tensile strength (f&#8217;[subscript] t) of the concrete samples. This analysis supplied a detailed understanding of the statistical relationship between different concrete material properties. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed, with multiple deflection and camber models, to create a statistical distribution of predicted deflections and cambers from the statistical distribution of concrete material properties. This statistical output is then critically analysed and compared to the surveyed data. Proposed improvements to the process of predicting deflections and cambers have been outlined. These improvements have then been utilised in the construction of a finite element style program. Finally, the multiple predictions of column strip and mid panel deformation are compared to the short term surveyed deflections. It is summarised that the improvements suggested and implemented in the finite style analysis yield results with a higher degree of accuracy. The accuracy and benefits of the suggested improvements has been justified and proven by the application of multiple examples and a parametric study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">deflections; deformations; concrete; slab; prestressed concrete; post-tensioned</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/61075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring cosmic-ray acceleration in the galactic realm.</field><field name="creator">Jones, David I.</field><field name="description">Despite many years of research dedicated to elucidating the conditions in which cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated, there is still great uncertainty about exactly how such particles are accelerated up to energies of 1 TeV (1 TeV= 10&#185;&#178; eV) and well beyond. Additionally, there is also great uncertainty about the structure and amplitude of the Galactic magnetic field which necessarily has a great impact upon the movement and interaction of CRs in the Galaxy. This thesis deals with a number of ways in which Gigahertz (GHz) frequency radio continuum observations can be used with GeV&#8211;TeV &#947;-ray observations to explore (i) the CR spectrum and (ii) the magnetic field amplitude in the Galaxy. An accurate knowledge of the CR spectrum and amplitude of the magnetic field has important consequences for a wide range of phenomena, such as particle acceleration and even star formation within the Galaxy. We present a simple static, single-zone model of secondary electron and positron production from CR protons and heavier nuclei interacting with ambient matter. We then apply this model, assuming a local CR spectrum, to predict the synchrotron emission from two cold, dense, massive molecular cores which are relatively nearby using a prescription for the magnetic field which scales as the (approximate) square-root of the hydrogen number density. Radio continuum observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) are then used to search for this emission and, due to the lack of detection, upper limits to the magnetic fields within these cores are obtained. We find that these limits are not inconsistent with the prescription used in the theoretical modeling. We also present observations of a giant molecular cloud located in the Galactic centre (GC) region, Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), chosen because of the expectation of a higher CR flux (than that observed at the top of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere). Based on previous work, the simple model presented in this thesis is then extended to include effects of CR diffusion into the Sgr B2 cloud parameterized by a &#8220;diffusion transport suppression&#8221; factor (and based on a molecular distribution &#8211; obtained from NH&#8323; spectral line emission studies &#8211; that can modeled as a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution). Our results show that the complex nature of the environment severely hampers the separation of the thermal and non-thermal emission so that no spectral, polarized or morphological evidence is found for non-thermal emission due to secondary electrons and positrons. Analysis of the radial brightness distribution from the centre of the main complex of Sgr B2 allowed us to place limits on the diffusion of GeV energy CRs into the cloud. This leads to a relative deficit of CRs at the centre of the cloud and a morphology which is reminiscent of a &#8216;limb-brightening&#8217; of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons. This is in contrast to to the TeV energy &#947;-rays from which a good correlation with molecular matter in the GC region is observed. This is interpreted by us as evidence of the exclusion of GeV energy CRs from the densest molecular environments in this region, whilst the TeV (or higher) CRs are able to freely penetrate these regions leading to the &#947;-ray -molecular line emission correlation observed by the HESS telescopes. Serendipitously, observations of this region uncovered evidence of non-thermal emission from a source to the south of the main complex of emission within Sgr B2. Analysis of archival XMM-Newton X-ray observations revealed an X-ray source located approximately 20&#8221; from the non-thermal radio source whose spectrum is strongly suggestive of a SNR. The non-thermal radio spectrum, X-ray source and spectrum were then used in concert with NH3 line emission to argue that this source is a SNR of approximately 3000 years of age which had exploded in this dense region. A large gradient in the NH&#8323; line emission towards the X-ray source suggests that any SNR shell would expand towards this region of lower density. Analysis of higher resolution 1720 MHz ATCA data revealed a weak source whose extension is coincident with the X-ray source. Finally, the observations of the Sgr B2 region were then expanded to explore the nature of the magnetic field amplitude on large scales in the region, of which there is a two orders of- magnitude uncertainty. Based on earlier work, which showed a large (6&#176; x 2&#176;) region of synchrotron emission at the GC, we assembled single-dish and interferometric observations of this region. The objective of this was to explore the possibility that a &#8216;spectral downturn&#8217; existed at GHz frequencies, which is due to the gradual dominance towards lower energies of the bremsstrahlung cooling rate over the synchrotron cooling rate. After the removal of appropriate background and the consideration of limitations at GeV and TeV energies, we found significant statistical evidence for a spectral break at ~ 2 GHz, which implies a magnetic field amplitude of 100 &#956;G in a density of ~ 100 cm &#8315;&#179;. An amplitude this high, on such large scales will have a large impact on processes such as particle acceleration, star-formation and gas-dynamics in the region.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cosmic rays; high energy astrophysics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/61076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Laboratory and modelling studies on the effects of injection gas composition on CO&#8322;-rich flooding in Cooper Basin, South Australia.</field><field name="creator">Bon, Johannes</field><field name="description">This Ph.D. research project targets Cooper Basin oil reservoirs of very low permeability (approximately 1mD) where injectivities required for water flooding are not achievable. However, the use of injection gases such as CO&#8322; would not have injectivity problems. CO&#8322; is abundant in the region and available for EOR use. CO&#8322; was compared to other CO&#8322;-rich injection gases with a hydrocarbon content including pentane plus components. While the effect of hydrocarbon components up to butane have been investigated in the past, the effect of n-pentane has on impure CO&#8322; gas streams has not. One particular field of the Cooper Basin was investigated in detail (Field A). However, since similar reservoir and fluid characteristics of Field A are common to the region it is expected that the data measured and developed has applications to many other oil reservoirs of the region and similar reservoirs elsewhere. The aim of this Ph.D. project is to determine the applicability of CO&#8322; as an injection gas for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) in the Cooper Basin oil reservoirs and to compare CO&#8322; with other possible CO&#8322;-rich injection gases. The summarised goals of this research are to: &#8226; Determine the compatibility of Field A reservoir fluid with CO&#8322; as an injection gas. &#8226; Compare CO&#8322; to other injection gas options for Field A. &#8226; Development of a correlation to predict the effect of nC&#8325; on MMP for a CO&#8322;- rich injection gas stream. These goals were achieved through the following work: &#8226; Extensive experimental studies of the reservoir properties and the effects of interaction between CO&#8322;-rich injection gas streams and Field A reservoir fluid measuring properties related to: &#8226;	Miscibility of the injection gas with Field A reservoir fluid &#8226;	Solubility and swelling properties of the injection gas with Field A reservoir fluid &#8226;	Change in viscosity-pressure relationship of Field A reservoir fluid due to addition of injection gas &#8226; A reservoir condition core flood experiment &#8226; Compositional simulation of the reservoir condition core flood to compare expected recoveries from different injection gases &#8226; Development of a set of Minimum Miscibility Pressure (MMP) measurements targeted at correlating the effect of nC&#8325; on CO&#8322; MMP. The key findings of this research are as follows: &#8226; Miscibility is achievable at practical pressures for Field A and similar reservoir fluids with pure CO&#8322; or CO&#8322;-rich injection gases. &#8226; For Field A reservoir fluid, viscosity of the remaining flashed liquid will increase at pressures below ~2500psi due to mixing the reservoir fluid with a CO&#8322;-rich injection gas stream. &#8226; Comparison of injection gases showed that methane rich gases are miscible with Field A so long as a significant quantity of C&#8323;+ components is also present in the gas stream. &#8226; There is a defined trend for effect of nC&#8325; on MMP of impure CO&#8322;. This trend was correlated with an error of less than 4%. &#8226; Even though oil composition is taken into account with the base gas MMP, it still affects the trend for effect of nC&#8325; on MMP of a CO&#8322;-rich gas stream. &#8226; An oil characterisation factor was developed to account for this effect, significantly improving the results, reducing the error of the correlation to only 1.6%. The significance of these findings is as follows: &#8226; An injection pressure above ~3000psi should be targeted. At these pressures miscibility is achieved and the viscosity of the reservoir fluid injection gas mix is reduced. &#8226; CO&#8322; should be compared to gases such as Tim Gas should after considering the cost of compression, pipeline costs and distance from source to destination will need to be considered. &#8226; The addition of nC&#8325; will reduce the MMP and increase the recovery factor, however the cost of the nC&#8325; used would be more than the value of increased oil recovered. &#8226; The developed correlation for the effect of nC&#8325; on impure CO&#8322; MMP can be used broadly within the limits of the correlation. &#8226; Further research using more oils is necessary to validate the developed oil characterisation factor and if successful, using the same or similar method used to improve other correlations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MMP; MMP correlation; minimum miscibility pressure; CO2 flooding; Cooper Basin; PVT; RBA; rising bubble apparatus; slim tube; core flood; compositional simulation; compositional analysis; reservoir fluid analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2440/61077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ng&#257; whakawhitinga: standing at the crossroads :  M&#257;ori ways of understanding extra-ordinary experiences and schizophrenia.</field><field name="creator">Taitimu, Melissa</field><field name="description">Indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities are being diagnosed with schizophrenia at significantly higher rates than majority groups all around the world.  Aetiological literature reveals a wide range of causal explanations including biogenetic, social and cultural factors.  A major limitation of this body of research is the assumption of schizophrenia as a universal syndrome.  When viewed through an indigenous lens, experiences labelled schizophrenic by Western psychiatry have been found to vary from culture to culture in terms of content, meaning and outcome.  The current project aimed to investigate M&#257;ori ways of understanding experiences commonly labelled &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  The philosophical frameworks that guided the research were Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory.  A qualitative approach was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 57 participants including tangata whaiora (service users), tohunga (traditional healers), kaumatua/kuia (elders), P&#257;keh&#257; clinicians, M&#257;ori clinicians, cultural support workers and students.  Four categories were derived from qualitative thematic analysis.  These being: making sense of the experiences, pathways of healing, making sense of the statistics and what can we do about the statistics.  Overall, M&#257;ori constructions related to other indigenous constructions of mental illness and wellbeing cited in the international literature but were in stark contrast to current psychiatric constructions.  The current project indicated M&#257;ori participants held multiple explanatory models for extra-ordinary experiences with the predominant explanations being spiritual.  Other explanations included psychosocial constructions (trauma and drug abuse), historical trauma (colonisation) and biomedical constructions (chemical brain imbalance).  Based on these findings, recommendations for the development of culturally appropriate assessment and treatment processes are presented. Over the last couple of centuries a single paradigm, the medical model, has come to dominate the explanation and treatment of illness in Western society.  Via legal and political means, indigenous models of illness and wellness have been wiped out or forced to the margins of many societies.  This thesis aims to challenge the dominant medical model that has privileged psychiatric knowledges while suppressing others by repositioning indigenous construction at the centre of the research via a Kaupapa M&#257;ori framework. Chapter One aims to deconstruct current medical constructions by presenting psychiatry as a culture in itself as opposed to a discipline dedicated to scientific truths.  This chapter posits that the culture of psychiatry has lead many clinicians to suffer from &#8220;cultural blindness&#8221; when working with indigenous and ethnic minority groups.  Chapter One uses the tools of science to question the scientific validity and reliability of the construct &#8220;schizophrenia&#8221;.  I conclude that this construct is &#8220;unscientific&#8221; in itself.  I will also look at three themes highlighted by other researchers regarding the treatment of mental illness throughout Western history: treatments are used as a form of social control; treatments can be dehumanising; and the dominance and power of the medical model to define who and what is considered ill.   Chapter One also acknowledges the significant role of the consumer movement in developing more humane treatments.  Interactions between culture and psychiatry via colonisation are outlined in Chapter Two. I also critique research that is conducted cross culturally in terms of whether researchers attempt to establish the reliability of universal diagnoses or recognise local and unique constructions.  Chapter Two challenges the commonly cited finding of higher rates of schizophrenia for ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples by questioning the validity of foreign cultural constructs to explain indigenous forms of illness.  This chapter recognises indigenous and cultural constructions of what psychiatry labels &#8216;schizophrenic&#8217;.  To illustrate, three &#8216;culture bound syndromes&#8217; will be discussed.  The development of indigenous psychological paradigms is also presented to position the current research within this wider international movement.  Chapter Three summarises M&#257;ori constructions of illness and wellness.  This chapter predominantly draws from early anthropological literature and subsequent psychological studies to represent the resilience of M&#257;ori constructions of experiences commonly labelled schizophrenic.  In accordance with the experiences of other indigenous populations, this chapter also recognises the impact of colonisation on M&#257;ori beliefs and practices relevant to maintaining wellness.  To illustrate the effect of colonisation, disparities in statistics between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori for admissions and readmissions to inpatients units for psychotic disorders will be discussed.  Explanations for these disparities will also be outlined.  Within Chapter Three, the resistance and revival of M&#257;ori constructions is also recognised as a function of the development of bicultural and Kaupapa M&#257;ori Services.  Chapter Four, summarises the theoretical orientation of the research.  This research is qualitative and assumes a post-modern critical paradigm.  Two theoretical frameworks were used within this research (Kaupapa M&#257;ori Theory and Personal Construct Theory) to represent the two worlds in which the research was conducted (Indigenous and Western).  Chapter Five outlines the methodology by recounting a somewhat layered journey.  Within the first section, &#8216;Who am I&#8217;, I have positioned myself by sharing my journey towards conducting this project.  The second section, &#8216;Where did I want to go&#8217;, outlines the research aims and process of consultation.  The final section summarises &#8216;What I did&#8217; in terms of qualitative interviews and the process undertaken for interpretation and presentation of the data.  Chapter Six presents the results of the research according to the four categories developed from qualitative analysis.  These were: &#8216;Making sense of extra-ordinary experiences&#8217;, &#8216;Pathways of healing&#8217;, &#8216;Making sense of the statistics&#8217; and &#8216;What can we do about the statistics&#8217;.  Within this chapter I have attempted to present quotes with as little interpretation as possible (over and above sorting of themes) to allow the reader to make their own interpretations before reading the discussion.  Chapter Seven summarises the major findings from each category and relates the results to the national and international literature.  Clinical and theoretical implications are discussed with recommendations for future research.  The limitations and strengths of the research are highlighted and conclusions drawn from the research journey.  The plan for dissemination is also presented.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">M&#257;ori psychology</field><field name="subject">schizophrenia</field><field name="subject">Kaupapa M&#257;ori theory</field><field name="subject">Indigenous psychology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of UHF communications on overhead earth-wires in power transmission networks</field><field name="creator">Castle, N. J.</field><field name="description">The motivation for this research is a proposed UHF surface wave communication system in which the waveguides are the stranded, overhead earth wires of Power System transmission lines. Attention is confined largely to an investigation of certain aspects which affect the overall surfaces wave transmission loss, a full-scale system having been set up in the laboratory for experimental purposes. For the prediction of transmission loss the stranded conductor is assumed to be equivalent to a solid conductor of the same diameter but with surface anisotropy in the form of two mutually orthogonal surface impedances the major reactive component of which is attributed to the effects of the helical stranding. This reactance is determined from a consideration of the fields which are assumed to exist within the cavities between the strands, and externally. From a comparison between experimental and theoretical loss characteristics there is sufficient inducement to accept the anisotropic model of the stranded conductor for practical design purposes. Approximate equations are developed to simplify the calculation of transmission loss and the notion of &#8216;capture cross-section&#8217; is employed for the estimation of the efficiency of conical horn launchers. It is deduced from &#8216;sensitivity&#8217; relationships that the horn loss is relatively insensitive to small changes in the fictitious surface reactance representing the effects of helical stranding, which tends to justify the assumptions upon which the anisotropic model is based. On the other hand, variations in the helix angle are shown to have a marked effect upon the calculated horn loss. This influences the choice of the stranded conductor used as the waveguide for the experimental verification of the model. The Author&#8217;s experimental research is described at length, the principal objective being to establish the anisotropic model as an acceptable theoretical substitute for the stranded conductor. To reduce the horn loss, dielectric sheaths are ted to the waveguide in the vicinity of the horn apertures. The discrepancies which then appear between theory and experiment are attributed both to the scattering of the surface wave by the boundary discontinuities at the ends of the sheaths and to the anomalous behaviour of commercial-grade PVC dielectric. Considering the increase in the transmission efficiency which may be realised by fitting dielectric sheaths to the conductor near the horn apertures it is concluded that a theoretical investigation of the scattering properties of the discontinuities  s in order. Thus, the remainder of the Thesis is devoted, to this scattering effect as it may be encountered in the proposed scheme, the theoretical analysis following the lines of earlier documented research. A short-cut method is applied for the determination of certain &#8216;half-plane&#8217; functions which appear in the expressions for the scattered power. Theoretical results are presented together with a discussion of some experimental measurements and a brief theoretical examination of the effects on the horn loss of varying the thickness of the dielectric sheaths. It is argued that the horn loss may be reduced if the dielectric thickness is graded in steps to a value at the horn apertures consistent with the desired &#8216;power capture&#8217;. The Thesis is concluded with an Addendum which outlines a number of topics suggested by the Author for future research.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Le Matuamoepo: competing 'spirits of governing' and the management of New Zealand-based Samoan youth offender cases</field><field name="creator">Suaalii, Tamasailau M.</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the 'spirits of governing' that currently frame youth justice approaches to Samoan youth offending in New Zealand, today. It claims that, in the current management of Samoan youth offending cases, three main spirits of governing are in play. These are the spirits of neo-liberal risk management cultural appropriateness, and faaSamoa. All three spirits operate simultaneously, in multilayered and intersecting ways. Gaining insight into this complexity is critical to building an understanding of the points of tension that may arise in the operationalisation of 'culturally appropriate' youth justice policies in the case of Samoan youth offenders. To highlight the complex character of these spirits of governing and their relationships, the thesis first describes each spirit of governing and then considers how they compete, intersect and/or diverge through a close analysis of seven youth justice cases. Analysis of each of the seven cases is based on interviews with a Samoan youth offender, a family representative, their CYFS social worker, police youth aid officer, Youth Court youth advocate and a community intervention programme worker. The key sites of government examined in this work are those of the family, the Youth Court, the youth justice family group conference and a community intervention programme service. The thesis reveals that to gain nuanced understanding of the complexities of managing a Samoan youth offender case, it is not simply a question of knowing what 'spirits of governing' are at play, one also needs to examine how they play. I contend that these three 'spirits' have specific relationships with each other. In youth justice, neo-liberalism opened up space for cultural appropriateness which, in turn allowed for the circulation of the faaSamoa. These three 'spirits', however, can not be reduced to each other because of their differing understanding of governmental strategies, techniques and subjects. In particular, they differ on their understanding of the role of families, of collaboration and of cultural expertise. Consequently, for example, while these three 'spirits of governing' 'agree' on the value of cultural appropriateness, they do not 'agree' on how it should be defined and measured. Too often when politically sensitive programmes or policies, such as those involving ethnic-specific cases, do not work, the response from politicians and programme personnel alike is to couch their failures in overly simplistic terms. This work seeks to indicate the importance of developing culturally nuanced models of analysis that can engage in the complexities of governing across cultural divides, in the improvement of practice in the field and in the development of a sociology capable of enhancing cross-cultural understanding.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of the relationship of the Crown in New Zealand with iwi Maori</field><field name="creator">Healy, Susan</field><field name="description">This study investigates the nature of the relationship that the state in New Zealand, the Crown, has established with M&#257;ori as a tribally-based people. Despite the efforts of recent New Zealand Governments to address the history of Crown injustice to M&#257;ori, the relationship of the Crown with Iwi M&#257;ori continues to be fraught with contradictions and tension. It is the argument of the thesis that the tension exists because the Crown has imposed a social, political, and economic order that is inherently contradictory to the social, political, and economic order of the M&#257;ori tribal world. Overriding an order where relationships are negotiated and alliances built between autonomous groups, the Crown constituted itself as a government with single, undivided sovereignty, used its unilateral power to introduce policy and legislation that facilitated the dispossession of wh&#257;nau and hap&#363; of their resources and their authority in the land, and enshrined its own authority and capitalist social relations instead. The thesis is built round a critical reading of five Waitangi Tribunal reports, namely the Muriwhenua Fishing Report, Mangonui Sewerage Report, The Te Roroa Report, Muriwhenua Land Report, and Te Whanau o Waipareira Report.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive method of measuring airway inflammation : exhaled nitric oxide</field><field name="creator">Byrnes, Catherine Ann</field><field name="description">Background Nitric oxide (NO) was well known to be a component of air pollution, often in the form of nitrogen dioxide (NO2). However its importance in biological systems altered dramatically with the discovery in 1987 that it was the 'endothelial-derived relaxing factor'. Since then there has been an explosion of research on NO demonstrating that this gaseous molecule was a widespread physiological mediator and was simultaneously recognised as a vital component of immune function contributing to macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. NO was therefore a key molecule in modulating inflammation, including airway inflammation. The aim of this thesis was: 1. To adapt a NO chemiluminscence analyser from measuring airway pollution to measuring exhaled air in human subjects. 2. To measure NO levels in exhaled air in adult subjects. 3. To evaluate whether altering measurement parameters altered the levels of NO obtained. 4. To adapt this technique from adults to measure exhaled NO in children. 5. To compare levels of NO from healthy children to groups of asthmatic children on either bronchodilator therapy only, or on regular inhaled corticosteroids. 6. To compare the levels of NO in a pilot group of asthmatic children before and after commencement of inhaled corticosteroids. Methods A Dasibi Environmental Corporation Model 2107 chemiluminescence analyser was adapted specifically requiring a reduction in response time, which was achieved by modification of the circuitry and re-routing of the analogue signal directly to a chart recorder, achieving a reduction of the response time by 80%. Addition of a number of analysers allowed the measurement of exhaled NO, carbon dioxide (CO2), mouth pressure and flow for each exhalation from total lung capacity. Twenty adult subjects (in total) were then studied looking at direct (NO, CO2, mouth pressure) versus t-piece (with the addition of flow) measurements making five exhalations from total lung capacity, at 3-minute intervals (direct/t-piece/direct or t-piece/direct/t-piece in series). The area of NO under the curve versus the peak of the NO trace was compared and the exhalation pattern of NO versus CO2 was compared. Measurement conditions were altered to evaluate the effect of individual parameters on the exhaled NO result. This included separately assessing different expiratory flows, different expiratory mouth pressures, the effect of a high versus a low background NO level and the effect of drinking water (of varying temperatures) prior to exhalation. Healthy control children were then enrolled to the study from a local school (Park Walk Primary School) and compared with asthmatic children enrolled from outpatient clinics at the Royal Brompton Hospital. The asthmatic children were further divided into those on bronchodilator treatment only and those on regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy. NO was also measured before and two weeks after commencing inhaled corticosteroid therapy in previously steroid-naive asthmatics. Results It was possible to modify a chemiluminescence analyser to enable measurement of exhaled NO. In 12 healthy subjects (mean age 32 years, 6 males) peak direct NO levels were 84.8 parts per billion (ppb) (standard error of the mean (SEM) 14.0ppb), significantly higher than 41.2ppb (SEM 10.8ppb) measured via the t-piece system. The exhaled NO rose to an early peak and plateau while the CO2 levels continued to rise to peak late in the exhalation. The mean times to peak NO levels were 32.2 seconds (s) (direct) and 23.1s (t-piece), which was significantly different from the mean times to peak CO2 levels at 50.5s (direct) and 51.4s (t-piece, p&lt;0.001). At peak NO level, the simultaneous CO2 level of 4.9% (SEM 0.47%, direct) and 5.2% (SEM 0.18, t-piece) were significantly lower than the peak CO2 achieved of 5.8% (SEM 0.21%, direct, p&lt;0.001) and, 6.2% (SEM 0.28, t-piece, p&lt;0.001). There was no difference between repeat direct or t-piece measurements. With regard to varying measurement conditions, the mean peak concentrations of NO decreased by 35ppb (95% confidence intervals 25.7-43.4) from a mean of 79ppb (SEM 15.4ppb) at an expiratory flow rate of 250mls/min to 54.1ppb (SEM 10.7ppb) at 1100mls/min. The mean peak concentration of NO did not change significantly when mouth pressure was increased in eight of ten subjects, although in two it did decrease in the highest pressure. The mean NO concentration with machine and subjects sampling from a low NO reservoir was 123ppb (SEM 19.4), which was an increase from results obtained before at 81.9ppb, SEM 10.2ppb, p=0.001 95%, CI -19.9 to -62.7) and after at 94.2ppb(SEM 18.3ppb, p=0.017, 95% CI 6.0-5.18) sampling with high ambient NO levels. The mean peak NO concentration decreased from 94.4ppb (SEM 20.8) to 70.8ppb (SEM 16.5, p=0.002 95% CI 12.9 -33.1) with water consumption. In 39 healthy pre-pubertal children with a mean age of 9.9 years (range 9-11 years, 23 girls) the mean direct exhaled No level was 49.6ppb (SD 37.8ppb, range 11.5-197.2ppb) compared with mean exhaled No via t-piece sampling of 29.2ppb (SD 27.1ppb, range 5.1-141.2ppb). There was no significant difference between boys and girls for either the direct or the t-piece recordings. In comparison with normal children, 15 asthmatic children on bronchodilator therapy only had much higher levels of exhaled NO at 126.1ppb via the direct system (SD 77.1ppb, p&lt;0.001) and 109.5ppb via the t-piece system (SD 106.8ppb, p&lt;0.001). In 16 asthmatics on regular inhaled corticosteroids the mean peak exhaled levels were significantly lower at 48.7ppb via the direct method (SD 43.3ppb, p&lt;0.001) and via the t-piece system at 45.2ppb (SD 45.9ppb, p&lt;0.01). There was no difference between the normal children and the asthmatic children who were on regular inhaled corticosteroids (p=0.9 direct, p=0.2 t-piece).There was no significant difference in CO2, mouth pressure, duration of expiration and expiratory flows between the three groups or between the two methods (direct and t-piece). In six asthmatic children the mean peak exhaled NO levels fell from a medium peak level of 124.5ppb to 48.6ppb when measured before and two weeks after commencement of inhaled corticosteroids on treatment. Discussion This research showed it was possible to modify an NO chemiluminescence analyser to enable measurement of exhaled NO in adult and paediatric subjects. Furthermore, it was possible to measure both healthy and asthmatic children. There were significant differences between the exhalation pattern of NO and CO2 suggesting that NO was produced in the airways, not at alveolar level, unlike CO2. The measurement of exhaled NO required a standardised approach as exhaled NO levels decreased with increasing expiratory flow, when measuring at a time of high ambient NO concentration, and with consumption of either hot or cold water immediately preceding exhalation (such as might be given if a subject was coughing). The findings with expiratory mouth pressure were less certain, with a difference seen in only two of ten subjects. The levels of exhaled NO measured in children aged 9-11 years were lower than that measured in the adult subjects. There was no difference between boys and girls, or with other parameters such as having a personal history of atopy, a family history of atopy, or the presence of a smoker or furry pets within the house-hold. These findings may have altered with increased numbers in this group and could possibly be a type two statistical error. The results of exhaled NO in asthmatic children on bronchodilator therapy only were significantly elevated compared to both normal children and asthmatic children treated with regular inhaled corticosteroids. The exhaled NO level also fell significantly by two weeks following the commencement of inhaled corticosteroid treatment in steroid-naive asthmatic children. These results suggested that the methods of measuring exhaled NO required standardization and that it could potentially be a non-invasive measure of airway inflammation to follow - particularly in children with asthma who were commencing inhaled steroid treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contemporary heart failure management</field><field name="creator">Wasywich, Cara Anne</field><field name="description">The research presented within this thesis aims to add to the current knowledge regarding contemporary heart failure (HF) management. Chapter 2 describes a study collating twenty years of HF admissions and mortality data from New Zealand (1988-2008). This study describes changes in HF epidemiology to provide context for further research focusing on indivudual patient aspects of HF management in the current era. Chapter 3 comprises a literature review examining the roles of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP, BNP-32 and NT-proBNP) and echocardiography in contemporary HF management. BNP and echocardiography have important diagnostic and prognostic utility in HF management and provide non-invasive assessment of left ventricular filling pressure. This review provides background for the following two chapters. Chapter 4 describes a study that evaluates the relationship between BNP-32 and echocardiographic measures of diastolic function (E/Ea) in patients admitted to hospital with acute decompensated HF. Chapter 5 describes a study that evaluates the relationship between NT-proBNP and E/Ea in HF patients during NT-proBNP guided treatment titration. These chapters add to current knowledge regarding the utility of E/Ea in patients with HF. Chapters 6 and 7 focus on co-morbidity associated with HF. It has been uncertain from previously published data whether the presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with HF is associated with an adverse prognosis. Chapter 6 comprises a literature-based meta-analysis of the prognostic effect of AF in HF compared to those with sinus rhythm. This study combines the results of 20 studies (32,946 patients, 10,819 deaths) and confirms that AF is associated with an adverse prognosis in HF. Chapter 7 describes a study that evaluates trans-myocardial metabolism of aldosterone, angiotensin II, BNP-32, and a marker of collagen synthesis in patients with ischaemic heart disease or severe aortic stenosis who have normal left ventricular ejection fraction. This study confirms myocardial release of aldosterone despite normal circulating aldosterone levels, strengthening the rationale for evaluation of aldosterone receptor antagonists in clinical situations not characterised by increased circulating aldosterone. This research has added to current understanding of HF and HF therapy, particularly focused on measures that may help to improve individual patient outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5973</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Totara Valley micro-hydro development : a thesis presented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Applied Science in Renewable Energy Engineering, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Donnelly, David Ronald</field><field name="description">This study focuses on the design, construction and operation of a distributed generation system based on micro-hydro technology. The project is sited in the Totara Valley, a small rural community approximately 70km from the Massey University, Turitea campus, Palmerston North. The Massey University Centre for Energy Research (MUCER) has a long history of renewable energy research within the Totara Valley community. This project complements these existing schemes and provides a foundation for future research into distributed generation technologies. The project encompasses the following objectives: - to gain practical experience in the design, engineering and implementation of a distributed generation system in rural New Zealand; - to evaluate contemporary micro-hydro technology and compare the performance of this equipment in a theoretical and practical context; - to identify barriers that hinder the widespread adoption of micro-hydro systems in rural New Zealand; - to develop a spreadsheet based life cycle costing tool. The results from this study demonstrate that economic considerations are the fundamental aspect to be considered when assessing the long-term viability of these projects. The viability of micro-hydro projects are primarily determined by four factors: - the volume and head (height) of water available above the turbine site; - the length and therefore the cost of the pipeline required for transporting water to the turbine; - the legal and administrative costs involved in obtaining a resource consent to maintain access to the water resources; - the prices received and paid for electricity. Considerable charges were payable to the local authority to secure and maintain the right to harness the water resources at this site. This cost contributed considerable risk to the project and creates a significant barrier to establishing similar systems at other sites. The reduction of resource consent charges to levels that fairly reflect the negligible environmental impacts of these projects would encourage the adoption of this technology and deliver benefits to rural New Zealand communities.</field><field name="date">0000</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">micro-hydro technology</field><field name="subject">distributed generation system</field><field name="subject">renewable energy</field><field name="subject">design</field><field name="subject">construction</field><field name="subject">viability</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291100 Environmental Engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The electronic, structural, and magnetic properties of the chromium dihalides - from the gas-phase to the solid-state : a thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theoretical Chemistry at Massey University, Albany, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Vest, Brian Michael</field><field name="description">Unrestricted Kohn-Sham (broken symmetry) density functional calculations have been used to determine the low-energy geometries of the chromium dihalide molecules (CrX2) and their clusters, Cr2X4, Cr3X6, and Cr4X8. The monomers are also investigated at a higher level, including coupled-cluster and state-average CASSCF computations. Our calculations show that the monomers have a 5B2 ground state arising from the Renner-Teller distorted 5IIg transition state, leading to a bent geometry. The global minima of the gas-phase clusters of CrF2 and CrCl2 consist of two-dimensional, anti-ferromagnetically coupled chains of CrX2 units forming four-membered, doubly bridged Cr2X2 rings, closely resembling their solid-state structures. The global minima of the CrBr2 and CrI2 clusters consist of the same two-dimensional chain-like structures for their dimers, but their trimers and tetramers consist of three-dimensional &#8217;triangular&#8217; structures which contain two capping ligands bound to three chromium atoms along with a Cr-Cr bond. Each Cr atom within these clusters has spin quantum number S=2. There is approximately a constant change in energy, between 45-55 kcal/mol, with every new CrX2 unit during cluster formation. Information about the structure of the CrCl2 clusters is used in the reanalysis of high-temperature electron diffraction data. The vapor at 1170 K contains about 77% monomeric molecules, 19% dimers, and a small amount of trimers. Monomeric CrCl2 is found to be bent with a bond angle of 149(10)degrees, in good agreement with our computations. Solid-state DFT calculations are performed on alpha-CrCl2 to determine the lattice structure and spin-coupling constants for the Cr atoms within the crystals. The GGA (PW91) method produces a structure in good agreement with the literature. In the lowest energy structure, the spins of the Cr atoms within the chains along the crystallographic c-axis are anti-ferromagnetically coupled with four parallel spins situated almost exclusively in the d-bands of Cr along these chains. This anti-ferromagnetic coupling is also seen in the CrX2 clusters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromium dihalides</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generic electric propulsion drive : a thesis in the partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Engineering in Mechatronics at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edmondson, Michael Charles</field><field name="description">Considerable resources worldwide are invested in the research and development of future transportation technology. The foreseen direction and therefore research of future personalised transportation is focused on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) or hybrid combinations that use hydrogen fuel cells. These new transport energy systems are consider most to replace the current vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine (ICE). The research work presented in this thesis mainly focuses on the development of a software control system for future BEV prototype vehicles - a generic intelligent control system (GICS). The system design adopts a modular design concept and intelligent control. The whole system consists of four modules being communication, power supply, motor driver and transmission module. Each module uses a microcontroller as the brain and builds an embedded control system within the module. The control and communication between the modules is based on a group of specific parameters and the status of a state machine. In order to effectively implement intelligent control and simplify the system structure and programming, a generic intelligent fuzzy logic model that can be configured to a specific application with a near real-time buffered communication methodology is developed. The tests made on the fuzzy control model and the near real-time buffered communication gave a very positive outcome. The implementation of the fuzzy control and the communication methodology in each of the modules results in a communication between the modules with a steady speed, better reliability and system stability. These modules link together through the communication channels and form a multi-agent collaborative system (MACS). As the controllers are designed based on the parametric concept, the system is able to be implemented to future new modules and therefore allow prototype vehicle control systems to be developed more efficiently. The MACS is based on the core components of the control system - fuzzy logic controller (FLC), Serial Communication and Analogue input control software modules. Further work is carried out as an attempt to integrate the control software with a hardware design for a generic electric propulsion drive (GEPD).

Under Sections 30 to 34 of the Nursing Act, these incentives include the following: (1) upgrading the minimum base salary of nurses from salary grade 10 to 15; (2) establishing a nurse specialty program in government hospitals to upgrade the nurses&#8217; skills whereby recipients of the program are required to work in government hospitals for two years; and (3) the provision of other benefits such as scholarship grants, free medical care, etc. These provisions are the government&#8217;s policy response to mitigate the impact of nurses&#8217; migration and retain an adequate supply of skilled Filipino nurses in the country: This research is a qualitative study that seeks to assess the health human resource development provisions and their implementation and aims to help improve them. This study examines the responsiveness of the provisions to the needs of nurses, and identifies the deficiencies of the provisions by looking into the working conditions of nurses in two Philippine government hospitals. It also examines the processes and the factors affecting the implementation of the provisions. This study employed a combination of four data collection methods: (1) focus group interviews of nurses working in two Philippine government hospitals, (2) key informant interviews of officials of government agencies and private organizations tasked to implement the health human resource development provisions, (3) document analyses, and (4) researcher&#8217;s field notes/journal. The researcher conducted five focus group interviews with a total of 15 nurse participants and 12 key informant interviews.  The nurses are working under conditions of low salaries and heavy workload, that is characterized by low nurse-to-patient ratios in the National and LGU Hospitals. The problems of inadequate nurse staffing, large number iii of patients and inadequate supplies in the two government hospitals are identified as causes for the heavy workload of nurses. The nurses want a salary increase that is commensurate to their heavy workload, their professional qualifications and long years of service. For the nurses, a salary increase signifies the government&#8217;s recognition of their dedication, hard work, and commitment to provide health care to Filipinos despite working under dire circumstances. The nurse specialty training program in areas such as oncology, nephrology, critical care, etc. has not been implemented because of the limited capacities of government hospitals to provide this kind of training and the lack of regulatory framework for the practice of nurse specialists in the Philippines. The other benefits have not been implemented as well. The provisions of the Nursing Act are deficient because they do not address the causes of the heavy workload of nurses. To improve the work conditions of nurses, the Philippine government needs to prioritize to the long neglected health sector by increasing the budgetary allocation in order to create more nurse positions in government hospitals, to provide adequate supplies and equipment for government hospitals and to improve the facilities for nurses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Filipino nurses</field><field name="subject">government hospitals</field><field name="subject">nurses' working conditions</field><field name="subject">Philippines</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360200 Policy and Administration::360201 Public policy</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparison of rice bran oil margarine with Flora margarine and Flora pro-activ margarine for lowering cholesterol : a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Human Nutrition at Massey University, Turitea Campus, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Eady, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">Phytosterols have been shown to be effective in reducing serum cholesterol levels in numerous human clinical studies and regular consumption is recommended as part of therapeutic lifestyle changes aimed at reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL-C) in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fat based spreads have been shown to be a very successful vehicle for delivery of plant sterols, readily accepted by consumers and efficacious in reducing cholesterol levels. Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread is a new product entering into the market place. It is derived from rice bran oil and contains high levels of unsaponifiable material rich in phytosterols, triterpene alcohols, ferulic acid esters ([gamma]-oryzanol) and vitamin E isomers. As such it may have the potential to lower serum cholesterol levels when consumed on a daily basis. In order to establish the effectiveness of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread compared with Flora pro-activ&#174; margarine, a well established brand of plant sterol margarine already proven to lower cholesterol, a randomised double blind cross-over human clinical trial over 12 weeks was conducted. The study was divided into two treatment arms. The first arm of the study was to determine whether Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread (containing 1.5% plant sterols) could lower total and LDL cholesterol levels to a greater extent than standard Flora margarine (containing no plant sterols) or Flora Pro-activ&#174; margarine (containing 8% plant sterols). The second study arm tested the proposition that daily consumption of Alfa One&#8482; Rice Bran Oil (RBO) spread in conjunction with rice bran oil (containing 0.5% plant sterols) would lower total and LDL cholesterol to a greater extent than Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in isolation and more than Flora margarine in conjunction with sunflower oil. Eighty mildly hypercholesterolaemic individuals (total cholesterol [greater than or equal to] 5 mmol/L and [less than or equal to] 7.5 mmol/L) were recruited and randomised into two groups of forty. Participants were asked to continue with their normal dietary pattern but to replace any margarine/butter/fat consumption with the trial products. One group of 40 were then assigned to the first treatment arm of the study (margarine-only group) and were randomised to consume 20 g (4 teaspoons) Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine daily for 4 weeks, or 20 Flora pro-activ&#174; daily for 4 weeks. Phytosterol levels delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma]-oryzanol; Flora proactiv&#174; 1600 mg phytosterol; Flora margarine 0mg phytosterol. The second group of 40 were allocated to the second arm of the trial (margarine and oil group) and consumed 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread and 30 ml rice bran oil (RBO) daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Flora margarine and 30 ml sunflower oil daily for 4 weeks, or 20 g Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread daily for 4 weeks, changing treatment at the end of each 4-week period. Phytosterol amounts delivered in these amounts were: RBO margarine: 118 mg phytosterol and 14 mg [gamma] oryzanol; RBO 222mg mg phytosterol, 150 mg [gamma] oryzanol. Each participant consumed all three treatments in a random order over a 12 week period. At baseline and following each 4 week intervention period, measurements were made of weight and blood pressure. Venous blood samples were collected for analysis of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol: HDL-C, triglycerides and plasma phytosterols. Three-day diet records from each individual were also collected for analysis of normal dietary intake. Results showed that compared to a standard Flora margarine, Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread significantly reduced total cholesterol by 2.2% (P=0.045), total cholesterol:HDL by 4.1% (P=0.005) and LDL-C by 3.5% (P=0.016), but was not as effective overall as Flora Pro-activ&#174; which reduced total cholesterol by 4.4% (P=0.001), total cholesterol:HDL by 3.4% (P=0.014) and LDL-C by 5.6% (P=0.001). Consumption of Flora margarine alone produced no significant decrease from baseline figures in any of the cholesterol parameters measured. Surprisingly, in group two, the addition of rice bran oil to the Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread produced no differences in cholesterol levels. The reason for this unexpected result is being explored further. These results confirm that Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread is effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels when consumed as part of a normal diet. Studies have shown that a 1% reduction in LDL-C can equate to a 2% decrease in coronary heart disease (CHD) risk thus suggesting that the 3.5% reduction demonstrated by Alfa One&#8482; RBO spread in this study could be effective in reducing CHD risk as much as 6% in a mildly hypercholesterolaemic population.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human nutrition</field><field name="subject">rice bran oil margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora margarine</field><field name="subject">Flora pro-activ margarine</field><field name="subject">phytosterols</field><field name="subject">plant sterols</field><field name="subject">reduction of serum cholesterol</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321205 Nutrition and dietetics</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/875</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nutritional characteristics of New Zealand export lamb and functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of technology in Bioprocess Engineering at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jansen, Eion</field><field name="description">Richmond Ltd. has recently undergone a change in strategy, away from the traditional commodity based meat industry, towards the modern food business. To do this, opportunities to add value to their current product range must be identified. This involves the conversion of traditionally low value commodity based products into products that demand a premium. An example of this is converting muscles that are currently used for grinding meat into a further processed convenience food (i.e. ready meals). Another method is to add further value to premium products by making them more appealing to consumers (i.e. nutritional information on labels). This work details investigations into the functional properties of selected beef forequarter muscles (low value commodity products) and the nutritional properties of selected export lamb products (premium products). The functional properties of a number of beef forequarter muscles were measured to identify which had the best potential for further processing applications with respect to ready meals. The functional properties of tenderness, cook loss and shrinkage were measured for the Latissimus Dorsi, Pectorialis Profundus (Point End Brisket), Infraspinatus (Cross Cut Blade), Triceps Brachi Longhead (Main muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod), Supraspinatus (Chuck Tender), Serratus Ventralis and Triceps Brachi Medialhead (Muscle in Bolar Shoulder Clod. From the tests conducted the Infraspinatus and the Triceps Brachi Longhead have been identified as having the best functional properties with respect to further processing for ready meal applications. As well as conducting tests to identify the forequarter muscles with the best potential for further processing applications, investigations were carried out to identify cooking regimes that would optimise the functional properties. This work confirmed that there are three major chemical reactions, which determine the resultant functional properties of cooked meat. They are the denaturation and aggregation of the myofibrillar proteins and the denaturation and solubilisation of connective tissue (collagen). At around 50&#176;C myosin (45% to 50% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in cook loss and reduction in water holding capacity. At around 60&#176;C collagen (main connective tissue protein) denatures, which results in a substantial increase in tenderness and increase in cook loss. This is because as the collagen denatures it loses it mechanical strength (increase in tenderness) and can no longer support its own structure, and causes it to contract. This contraction causes fluid within the meat and cook loss caused by the denaturation of myosin to be expelled from the meat by compressive forces (squeezed out). At around 70&#176;C actomyosin (22% of the myofibrillar proteins) denatures. This results in a substantial increase in the cook loss and firming of the meat. The increase in cook loss or decrease in water holding capacity that occurs with myofibrillar protein denaturation is due to the fact that when these proteins denature and aggregate their ability to bind water is greatly reduced. From the results of the cooking regime trials it is recommended that for functional property considerations that during the cooking of further processed meat products (i.e. ready meal applications) a meat temperature of 62&#176;C should be aimed for, for the slowest heating region during cooking (usually the centre). This is because it has been identified that a cooking temperature of 65&#176;C should not be exceeded otherwise detrimental effects can occur to the functional properties of the cooked meat. For health concerns a 7D bacterial death reduction has to be achieved. This means that for a cooking temperature of 62&#176;C the meat has to be held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes. Therefore the total cooking time would be the time needed to heat all the meat to 62&#176;C plus 5 minutes to ensure a safe product. The heating or cooking system employed should also ensure that a minimal amount of the meat is heated above 65&#176;C. This can be easily achieved by minimising the external cooking temperature, but long cooking times will result. An industrial cooking process will be a compromise between the cost associated with longer residence time and product functionality. As mentioned earlier another way to add value is to supply nutritional information for selected cuts. Consequentially one of the objectives of this project was to provide some nutritional information for selected meat cuts. Though the primary objective of this part of the project was to develop a method for producing the needed information, so that Richmond N.Z. Ltd. can develop further information on an as needs basis. The nutritional characteristics of a number of export lamb cuts from the saddle region has also been investigated and a method devised to allow further characterisation of other cuts. The method involves breaking down a standard cut into its constituent components (e.g. Frenched rack consists of loin eye, fat cap, intercostals and fatty tissue). The constituent components are tested for their nutritional properties. The frenched rack nutritional properties are calculated from the nutritional properties of the constituents components and the yield data (percentage of each constituent component within a frenched rack) for frenched racks. This method allowed the identification of the main sources of variation for nutritional characteristics. These differences were found to be caused by the lean to fat ratio, not nutritional differences in lean tissue from the same region of lamb (i.e. loin eye and tenderloin very similar nutritionally). The difference in lean to fat ration also accounts for the variation between grades (i.e. PX grade lamb cuts have a higher fat content than YX grade lamb cuts due to PX grade cuts having a higher percentage fat tissue in their cuts). The cuts characterised were the shortloin section (whole section or chop), rack section (whole section or chop), 75mm racks frenched 25mm, boneless loin and tenderloin for both PX and YX grade lamb. The method will be applicable to other regions of lamb (i.e. hindquarter and forequarter) for which nutritional information already exists, but for which yielding data will have to be collected. The method would also be applicable to other species such as beef and venison, but both nutritional data for constituent components and yielding data would have to be collected.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Infraspinatus</field><field name="subject">Triceps Brachi Longhead</field><field name="subject">ready meals</field><field name="subject">cooked meat</field><field name="subject">protein denaturation</field><field name="subject">nutritional properties</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290103 Food processing</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/895</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Production of blue pigments from the callus cultures of Lavandula augustifolia and red pigments (betalain) from the hairy root culture of Beta vulgaris : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Technology in Biotechnology at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Oommen, Retty</field><field name="description">Plants are used to produce many secondary metabolites that are too difficult, expensive or impossible to make by chemical synthesis. Conventional cultivation of plants is of course subject to vagaries of weather, pests and availability of land; hence, the interest in highly controlled culture of plant cells and hairy roots in bioreactors as methods of producing various products. This project focussed on production of blue and red colors of Lavandula augustifolia and Beta vulgaris, respectively. Callus and suspension cell culture were successfully produced from L. augustifolia after extensive trials, but hairy roots could not be generated from this species. In contrast, a successful protocol was developed for consistently producing hairy roots from B. vulgaris, but calli could not be generated from this species. Effects of medium composition on growth of L. augustifolia calli and freely suspended cells and production of the blue pigment by the latter, were investigated. Optimal production of callus occurred in full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 2 mg/l of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and 1 mg/l of kinetin. Stable suspension cultures could be produced and maintained in full-strength MS medium supplemented with 1 mg/l each of IAA and kinetin. In suspension culture in full-strength MS medium, the following hormone combinations were tested: (1) 1 mg/l each of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and kinetin; (2) 2 mg/l of IAA and 1 mg/l of kinetin; (3) 2 mg/l of IAA and 1 mg/l of benzyl amino purine (BAP); and (4) 2 mg/l each of IAA and BAP. Combination (3) maximized cell growth, but the highest cell-specific production of the blue pigment was seen in combination (2), although pigment production occurred at all hormone combinations. The medium formulation that gave the best production of the pigment in shake flasks was scaled up to a 2 L aerated stirred tank bioreactor, but both the biomass and pigment productivities were reduced in the bioreactor apparently due to the high shear stress generated by the Rushton turbine impeller. Compared to suspension cultures of L. augustifolia, the hairy root cultures of B. vulgaris grew extremely rapidly. Hairy roots also produced large amounts of the red pigments. Growth of hairy roots was influenced by the composition of the medium. Although the full strength MS medium better promoted biomass growth compared to the half-strength MS medium, the final concentration of the biomass and the pigment were nearly the same in both media. Attempts were made to enhance production by using various hormones (i.e. naphthalene acetic acid, BAP, IAA added individually at a concentration of 0.5 mg/l), but none of the hormones proved useful. BAP adversely affected the growth of hairy roots. In summary, production of pigments by suspension culture of L. augustifolia and hairy root culture of B. vulgaris, is technically possible, but requires substantial further optimization for enhancing productivity than has been possible in this project. iii</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pigment production</field><field name="subject">biomass growth</field><field name="subject">lavender</field><field name="subject">beetroot</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the antioxidant activity of milk proteins in model oil-in-water emulsions : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology, Riddet Institute, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Ries, Daniel</field><field name="description">The present study was aimed at extending our knowledge of the antioxidative properties of the milk protein products, whey protein isolate (WPI) and sodium caseinate (NaCas), in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). In particular, the objective was to contribute to our understanding of the compositional and processing factors that influence the oxidative stability of protein-stabilised O/W emulsions. Linoleic acid (approximately 60 %) was used as the lipid for the oil phase (10.6 %). The emulsion samples were usually incubated at 50 &#176;C to accelerate lipid oxidation. Lipid oxidation indicators were lipid hydroperoxides and headspace hexanal, determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) combined with gas chromatography (GC). WPI- or NaCas-stabilised emulsions were prepared using a wide range of protein concentrations (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 7.0 or 10.0 %) at two droplet sizes (d32 = 0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m). In general, higher lipid oxidation levels were found for the larger droplet size. Increasing protein concentration led to a decrease in the lipid oxidation rate. The greatest decrease in lipid hydroperoxide levels (values after 4 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration. The greatest decrease in hexanal levels (values after 24 h) occurred at up to 4.0 % protein concentration in WPI emulsions (0.31 &#181;m). The hexanal levels were more independent of the protein concentration in the other emulsion types. The hexanal level decreased at protein concentrations &gt; 4.0 % in NaCas emulsions (0.31 and 0.65 &#181;m) and at protein concentrations &gt; 7.0 % in WPI emulsions (0.65 &#181;m). The difference between lipid hydroperoxide generation in emulsions with small and large droplet sizes decreased with increasing protein concentration. This effect was more pronounced in NaCas emulsions. In general, NaCas was a better inhibitor of lipid oxidation than WPI, but WPI appeared to be the better antioxidant at some droplet size/protein concentration combinations. The protein in the continuous phase, i.e. the unadsorbed protein, played an important role in lipid oxidation. In principal, the lipid hydroperoxide and hexanal levels showed the same development over the continuous phase protein concentration as over the protein concentration in WPI and NaCas emulsions (d32 = 0.31 &#181;m). A low NaCas level in the continuous phase already led to a relatively low hexanal level, whereas a higher WPI level was required. When NaCas solution was added to a WPI emulsion or WPI solution was added to a NaCas emulsion, a synergistic antioxidative effect was observed. The high molecular weight fractions (molecular weight = 12000-14000) of WPI and NaCas contained pro-oxidative metal ions that contributed to lipid oxidation in the emulsions. An enrichment of NaCas emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of NaCas (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) notably inhibited lipid oxidation. An enrichment of WPI emulsions with the low molecular weight fraction of WPI (with a molecular weight = 12000-14000) also seemed to inhibit lipid oxidation, but the effect was not significant. The protein solutions were enriched with these fractions before emulsion preparation. Pure WPI solution or mixed WPI/NaCas (1:1, weight/weight) solution with 1.12 or 2.24 % protein concentration was heated at 84 &#176;C for up to 40 min, cooled and then used to prepare emulsions. Lipid oxidation was generally not affected by the heat treatment or the degree of whey protein denaturation. However, at the lower WPI concentration, more hexanal was produced for the longer heating times (20, 30 and 40 min) and this appeared to be connected with the physical instability of the emulsions. Greater oxidative stability was found at the higher protein concentration and when the proteins were mixed, pointing to a possible synergistic antioxidative effect of WPI and NaCas. The addition of the free radical source 2,2&#8217;-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) greatly increased the oxygen uptake and the generation of lipid hydroperoxides in the emulsions. The oxidative stability increased with increasing protein concentration (1.0, 4.0 and 7.0 %). NaCas had a greater antioxidative effect than WPI. The inhibition of oxygen uptake appeared to be largely influenced by the free-radical-scavenging activity of the system, determined by the protein type and the protein concentration, as the radicals were produced linearly over time and oxygen was consumed linearly over time. It can therefore be concluded that free-radical-scavenging activity represents a major antioxidative mechanism of the milk proteins. Oxygen was consumed much faster in emulsions than in protein solutions when the same level of AAPH was incorporated. In a WPI (1.0 % protein) emulsion, much lower levels of protein hydroperoxides than of lipid hydroperoxides developed. This pointed to a much greater reactivity of linoleic acid than of the milk proteins with oxygen. In contrast, the exposure of WPI to oxidising linoleic acid in an emulsion (1.0 % protein) or to AAPH in aqueous solution led to oxidative damage of the whey proteins, indicated by the loss of amino acids. The loss of specific amino acids was different for proteins in the continuous phase or cream phase of an emulsion or in WPI solution. The present study confirms the antioxidative potential of WPI and NaCas and gives new insights into their functionality as oxidative stabilisers in O/W emulsions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey protein isolate</field><field name="subject">sodium caseinate</field><field name="subject">lipid oxidation</field><field name="subject">oxidative stabilisers</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290100 Industrial Biotechnology and Food Sciences::290101 Fermentation, biotechnology and industrial microbiology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation, characterization and possible biocontrol application of Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) isolated from NZ sources : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) at Massey University</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Muftikhar</field><field name="description">Bdellovibrionaceae (BD) are unique, predatory, endoparasitic, Gram-negative bacteria. As the world's smallest living hunter they prey on other Gram-negative bacteria giving them potential as biological control agents. Prior to this study, however, there were no reports of BD in New Zealand. The overall aim of this research was to isolate BD from New Zealand sources, characterise them and investigate their potential role as a biological control agent. The history, characteristics, life cycle and mechanism of predation of this organism are reviewed and the possibility of the industrial applications of BD, are discussed. In this study, a halophilic species of BD was isolated from fourteen coastal sea water sites around New Zealand. Thirteen isolates were characterised using proven characterisation techniques including general, microscopic and molecular techniques. It was found that the isolates were taxonomically identical or very closely related to each other and belong to the genus Bacteriovorax. The predation pattern of BD isolates was examined against a group of Gram negative bacteria in solid and liquid media. The predation patterns and efficiencies of the different BD isolates were similar, which confirms that the BD isolates are closely related, are selective in their predation, and prey on some Gram-negative bacteria but not all. The rapid loss of culture viability of BD is well known, but no studies have been reported to date on the survival of pure cultures of BD at different temperatures. The survival rate of BD in dense suspensions at different temperatures without host bacteria was investigated and it was observed that pure BD cultures can be stored with minimal reduction in numbers at temperatures ranging from 4&#176;C to 20&#176;C. However, significant reductions in numbers were observed at -1 8"C, 30&#176;C and 37&#176;C after 13 to 16 days. The effects of the 13 New Zealand BD isolates on the growth of a population of Photobacterium phosphoreum were examined to select the best isolate for in vitro application. All of the isolates tested had considerable reduction effect against P. phosphoreum. Some isolates were more effective than others, despite their taxonomic similarity to each other. The isolate OT2 was selected for further studies based on these results. The in vitro efficacy of BD was assessed against late exponential cultures of a seafood spoilage bacterium, P. phosphoreum, originally isolated from Cod fillets from Denmark. Loglo reductions of P. phosphoreum and some other Gram-negative bacteria ranged from 4.5 to 4.8 after 9 h of incubation at 25OC. BD was effective in reducing the numbers of P. phosphoreum at pH 5.5 to 8.5 and salinity 0.9 to 4.5% (wlv). A significant interaction was observed between the prey and predator concentrations and nutrient concentration. Prey concentrations were observed to be the most vital factor in predation and the most favourable predation conditions were at a prey concentration of -8 loglo colony forming units (CFU)/mL, together with a predator concentration of 3 - 7 loglo plaque forming units (PFU)/mL and a prey : predator ratio of &gt;5.0. The thresholds of the prey and predator concentrations for predation were observed to be 3.7 loglo CFUImL and 3.9 loglo PFUImL, respectively. The trials carried out in this study focused on the efficiency of BD on a pure culture of one organism, P. phosphoreum and not on mixed cultures of Gramnegative spoilage bacteria, the normal condition observed in saltwater fish. There has been very little research in this field and the results of these trials suggest further investigation into the effect of BD on mixed cultures of Gram-negative spoilage organisms is warranted. Since only one isolate of BD (OT2) was examined against only one spoilage bacterium (P. phosphoreum) in liquid medium, the evidence of these findings must be restricted to these particular conditions. Future studies, using a range of BD isolates against a mixture of spoilage and pathogenic organisms in solid medium are warranted. The biopreservation capability of BD in extending the shelf life of king salmon was evaluated. A significant effect was observed at 20&#176;C but not at 10&#176;C. At 20&#176;C the shelf life was extended through extension of the lag phase of growth of the prey bacteria and a reduction in total numbers attained. Sensory evaluation of the salmon product being tested confirmed that the shelf life was extended. However, at 10&#176;C there was no reduction in prey organisms, which suggested that the strain of BD used is ineffective at refrigeration temperatures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus</field><field name="subject">Photobacterium phosphoreum</field><field name="subject">Fishery products</field><field name="subject">Biocontrol</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Biotechnology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1392</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Informative ornament: &#8216;The machine&#8217; : enhancing the communicative potential of colour : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Design in Illustration at Massey University, Wellington, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Malcolm, Sabrina Barkley</field><field name="description">Accompanying workbook not available in digital format</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Illustration</field><field name="subject">Colour-blind</field><field name="subject">Visual communication design</field><field name="subject">Patterned colour</field><field name="subject">Wordless picture books</field><field name="subject">Fantasy</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts::410200 Visual Arts and Crafts Studies::410202 Fine arts studies (incl. sculpture and painting)</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1465</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hokia ki te whenua : a thesis presented in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Soil Science at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Roskruge, Nick</field><field name="description">This thesis aIms to produce a distinctive model for the sustainable horticultural development of Maori resources, primarily land. It is inclusive of tikanga Maori and indigenous production systems based on the unique body of knowledge aligned to Maori. The integration of this knowledge with western science is both argued and applied through the model itself. The hypothesis applied was that matauranga Maori relevant to horticulture and pedology can inform and add value to the future development of Maori land resources. The thesis is bui lt on a unique set of contributing knowledge bases aligned to soils and horticultural management supported by three case studies, identified through their common association i.e. whakapapa links. The format of the thesis intentionally follows science principles in structure and presentation and some assumptions are made regarding base knowledge surrounding Maori cultural factors and the science disciplines relative to soils and horticul ture. The indigenous element, including Maori knowledge, is incorporated into the model using a triadic kosmos/corpus/praxis approach. Where kosmos is applied as Te A o Miiori, corpus as miitauranga Miiori and praxis as tikanga Miiori, the relationship between each element is clear and the interpretation of the associated knowledge becomes more apparent and can be applied to cultural assessments of resources, i ncluding land. The crux of the cultural assessment model is the quality of information used to assess Maori resources, especially from the cultural perspective. The Maori cultural paradigm, traditional horticulture and pedology, and various decision systems are purposefully accessed to act as contributors to the assessment model and to highlight the diversity and quality of information land managers have at their disposal. The ability to apply a cultural layer drawn from a body of knowledge not previously included in decision models relative to land utility in New Zealand is the key point. of difference of the model. The model is discussed from the perspective of its beneficial role for future use by Maori and how it can be continuously refined to meet the needs of Maori land owners and thus contribute to the rangatiratanga of Maori.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horticulture</field><field name="subject">Land tenure</field><field name="subject">Rural development</field><field name="subject">Rural land use</field><field name="subject">Indigenous crops</field><field name="subject">Maori</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Soil Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300100 Soil and Water Sciences::300104 Land capability and soil degradation</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10179/1725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of artificial thermoluminescence to uranium exploration and uranium ore genesis studies</field><field name="creator">Hochman, Mark Brett McEwen.</field><field name="description">Typescript (Photocopy) Includes copies of 5 published papers co-authored by the author in back Bibliography: leaves 214-230</field><field name="date">1989</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Thermoluminescence dosimetry</field><field name="subject">Thermoluminescence dating</field><field name="subject">Uranium ores Geology</field><field name="subject">Radioactive prospecting</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh6825.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:8988318</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Random bit interleaving for trunk link encryption</field><field name="creator">Einicke, Garry A.

Includes bibliographical references (leaves [279]-287) This thesis examines the growth ring structure of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnhardt and investigates links between ring features and the climatic conditions under which growth took place. Samples of E. camaldulensis from the Barmah Forest (near the River Murray in northern Victoria) were used in the study. E. camaldulensis growth is linked to periodic flooding, and the Barmah Forest contains sites that are frequently flooded. Wood samples were obtained from sites subject to different average flooding frequencies. Trees used in the study grew out of natural regeneration in the 1920's and 1930's and from regeneration trials in the early 1960's. Initial investigation of E. camaldulensis samples revealed ring-like features that were able to be traced on samples by eye. Microscopic investigation showed that there existed considerable variations in the properties of individual rings at different positions on the samples, and that the boundaries between rings were often indistinct. Further examination of E. camaldulensis microstructure was performed on samples from two trees that grew on sites with significantly different flooding regimes. These samples possessed features that formed rings, with rings being successfully matched between samples taken from different heights in the trees. As the complex microstructure of E. camaldulensis did not lend itself to standard dendroclimatological techniques, methods were developed to facilitate the comparison and matching of rings. These methods were also used in the successful matching of ring patterns with the output from a simple climate-based tree growth model. Two sets of E. camaldulensis samples (BS1, with 33 samples, and BS2, with 39 samples) were studied to assess the level of individual variability in ring patterns, and to provide a representative ring pattern for climate comparison. Following the development of methods for identifying samples with similar ring patterns, a subset of similar samples was selected from the BS1 set. A member of this subset was selected to provide a ring-width pattern upon which a representative pattern of ring features for BS1 was based. The rings of the BS2 samples possessed poorer ring definition than the BS1 samples and provided no new or different information. Consequently, the representative ring pattern for BS1 was used in a dendroclimatological investigation for the site. The ring pattern was matched with the output from two tree growth event models. Although rings were matched with growth events over a 27 year period, the high variability of individual ring features prevented matching of particular types of ring features with particular types of climatic events. An investigation of numerical methods for matching ring patterns with ring or growth event patterns, and for identifying samples with similar ring patterns, was performed using signal smoothing and filtering techniques and a dynamic time-warping procedure. Ring matching and identification of similar ring patterns was found to be most successful on samples where the ring patterns, expressed as continuous signals, had similar mean and amplitude values. The techniques were unsuccessful in the matching of signals of different form, such as continuous ring pattern signals and discontinuous growth event signals.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">VBX</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus camaldulensis Victoria Barmah State Forest Effect of floods on</field><field name="subject">Dendroclimatology Victoria Barmah State Forest</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.lib.unimelb.edu.au/adt-root/public/adt-VU2001.0019/index.html</field><field name="identifier">NBD:11788009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pubertal development in the merino ram lambs and immunization against oestrogens</field><field name="creator">Auclair, Dyane.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 281-316.

The thesis studies the role of sugars in desiccation tolerance in developing seeds and investigates other mechanisms which might be involved in desiccation tolerance and desiccation sensitivity.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Seeds Drying</field><field name="subject">Seeds Development</field><field name="subject">Wheat Seeds Viability</field><field name="subject">Wheat Hardiness</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phk859.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:12579090</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The literary importance of the Sydney "Bulletin"</field><field name="creator">Naughtin, Patrick Chanel.</field><field name="description">Reproduced from the copy in the University of Adelaide.</field><field name="date">1955</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">QU</field><field name="subject">Bulletin (Sydney, N.S.W.)</field><field name="subject">Australian literature History and criticism</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ARM/09armn29.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:12607629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetics of barley yellow dwarf virus resistance in barley and rice</field><field name="creator">Collins, Nicholas C.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliographical references.

This thesis analyses the molecular composition of the surface components of the Endoparasitoid "Venturia canescens" using serological methods and specific sugar-binding lectins as diagnostic tools. The data reveals that the protective layer consists of at least two parts: a mucin-like glycoprotein and additional components from the wasp calyx fluid and the host hemolymph. The study suggests that the wasp larval cuticle is protected in a similar fashion to the egg chorion, except that the calyx-specific VLPs are probably replaced on the larval cuticle by host hemolymph proteins. The findings suggest that the mechanism of passive immune evasion could emerge during the evolution of the wasp-host interactions. The implication is that structurally conserved components may have similar functions in the parasitic and non parasitic species and could constitute a useful pre-adaptations for an endoparasitoid lifestyle.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Venturia</field><field name="subject">Ephestia</field><field name="subject">Parasitoids</field><field name="subject">Host-parasite relationships Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Natural immunity Genetic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phk56.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:12825962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Introduction of Aphidius rosae into Australia for biological control of the rose aphid (Macrosiphum rosae)</field><field name="creator">Kitt, J&#246;rg Thomas.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 221-240.

Biblography: leaves 162-173. Phytophagous sucking insects, aphids in particular, are common pests of plants. These insects secrete salivary enzymes into their food material. One plant defence mechanism is the induction and/or accumulation of deterrent phytochemicals. In the present study, a model enzyme system was chosen to mimic the oxidative activity of insect saliva. Isolation and sructural identification of the products of plant allelochemicals was achieved for several substrates. Insects were also exposed to individual plant chemicals in feeding "choice" tests.

Methods are developed to separate SOM from different locations within the soil matrix. Free particulate organic matter (POM), located between or outside the soil aggregates is isolated. Occluded POM is disaggregeted by sonification. The compositional differences noted among the three components of SOM are used to describe the changes that OM undergoes during decomposition. The process is followed as organic matter enters the soil, is enveloped in aggregates and is eventually incorporated into the microbial biomass and metabolites then becoming associated with clay minerals.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Humus Composition</field><field name="subject">Humus Analysis</field><field name="subject">Soils Composition</field><field name="subject">Soil chemistry</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phg617.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:13117642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and yield of durum and bread wheat</field><field name="creator">Zubaidi, Akhmad.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 148-160.

This thesis investigates the mechanism(s) involved in the protection of Capsicum seedlings by two isolates of BNR against the damping-off fungus, P.u. sporangiiferum. Emphasis is placed on ecological attributes of the antagonists in relation to the pathogen, in conditions resembling those of the nursery environment for which biological control is intended. It is proposed that competition for resources, such as the host tissues with exudate-rich infection sites and the organic residue in the potting mix, is the principal factor influencing the interactions between P.u. sporangiiferum and BNR. It is also suggested that BNR isolates employ at least three strategies to exert competitive advantage over P.U. sporangiiferum. It is postulated that the ability of BNR to capture and utilise resources, in the presence of a potential competitor, is the principal attribute of these biocontrol agents that brings about a sucessful control of P.u. sporangiiferum in nursery potting mix.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Pythium ultimum Biological control</field><field name="subject">Rhizoctonia</field><field name="subject">Peppers Diseases and pests</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phs624.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:13117705</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of subsoil mineral nitrogen on grain protein concentration of wheat</field><field name="creator">Lotfollahi, Mohammad.</field><field name="description">Copy of author's previously published work inserted.

The experiments lead to the discovery that antioxidants can upregulate the LDL receptor in the human HepG2 cells.</field><field name="date">1996</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09php153.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:13504903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cardiac dysfunction and lactic acidosis during hyperdynamic and hypovolemic shock</field><field name="creator">Cooper, David James, 1956-</field><field name="description">Bibliography: p. 137-154.

Explores the social dynamics of and interconnections between identity, relatedness and kinship. Argues that identity is fundamentally implicated in understandings of, conflict over and practices around relatedness and kinship. To study identity with regard to the exigencies of relatedness and kinship, uses adoption as an ethnographic and conceptual vehicle and argues that the cultural constructions and interplays between the biogenetic and the social in circumstances associated with adoption are both contextual and potent in relation to multifarious claims to and persuits of identity. Identity and questions of agency are understood as sites for creative struggles by individual agents, within a matrix of competing, often contradictory social forces, tendencies and processes.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09pht271.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:14547485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurements of tropospheric scatter with a new multi-beam, multi-receiver VHF doppler radar</field><field name="creator">Hobbs, Bridget.</field><field name="description">Copy of author's previously published article inserted.

The study of dynamics models of tick populations on sleepy lizards considered the effect of  spatial and temporal variability, and demonstrated that counting ticks is a poor indicator of tick abundance. The "virtual ecologist" model is a useful method for linking the output of spatially explicit population models to reality, and will be a valuable approach for improving the design of ecological field research on spatially complex landscapes.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Ecology Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Spatial ecology Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Insect populations Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Population biology Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Animal populations Mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09AEVP/09aevpt992.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21354871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential for improving the drought resistance of soybean (Glycine max (L.)

The improvement of drought tolerance of commercial soybean varieties via indirect selection for transpiration efficiency (TE) in breeding programs was investigated. The extent and nature of variation for TE among soybean genotypes were established through glasshouse experiments under well watered conditions, and confirmed in the field under contrasting water stress conditions. The results suggest that increasing TE will be a beneficial strategy to improve soybean grain yield at the crop level, and a protocol developed suited to indirect selection for high TE soybean genotypes under a range of environments.

Rampion mignonette is an annual to short-lived perennial agricultural weed from the Mediterranean region, first found in vineyards at Clare, South Australia, in 1986. The biology and ecology of rampion mignonette was studied to provide a basis for its integrated control and management. The study includes a literature review, maps of world and Australian distribution and drawings showing plant habit and details. A field survey found that rampion mignonette showed little migration and that containment and population reduction could be achieved by careful management including both chemical and cultural techniques. Common herbicides were also found to be effective in controlling the weed. An experiment established that it is unlikely to become a major weed of broadacre crops and pastures in the South Australian dryland farming system.

This study reports the first thorough investigation of palatability variation in Atriplex vesicaria Heward ex Benth. (bladder saltbush). Intensive small-plot dietary trials, supported by a paddock dietary experiment, cross-fence comparisons and cafeteria trials,  showed that sheep preferentially grazed female saltbushes over male and bisexual ones. Sheep avoided male saltbushes due to a chemical deterrent, and used visual (male flower spike) and olfactory cues to detect male plants. The effect of this selective grazing was to reduce the size and reproductive output of female shrubs. Sheep also tended to return to shrubs they had grazed previously. In the semi-arid regions of South Australia, where bladder saltbush is grazed year-round, physical protection is recommended to maximise survival and reproductive output of heavily grazed shrubs.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Grazing Australia, Southern</field><field name="subject">Atriplex vesicaria</field><field name="subject">Sheep Australia, Southern Feeding and feeds</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm474.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21354983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sustainability of dryland cropping systems in the Wimmera region of Victoria / y Yvonne L.

Two systems of dryland cropping, one conventional and one conservation, were studied on the same farm over a period of 10 and 14 years respectively. The conventional cropping system was based on cultivated fallow which served to manage and conserve water, nitrified organic matter and controlled weeds. Stubble was burnt prior to cultivation for the fallow phase, with pasture and cropping phases rotated. The conservation farming system was based on the absence of soil tillage, stubble retention, rotation of a variety of crops and chemical control of weeds. Water conservation was achieved through increased infiltration by improved soil structure, avoidance of compaction, reduced water runoff and reduced evaporation by stubble retention. Overall, the conventional farming system was proven to be unsustainable. The conservation system was sustainable in terms of productivity, profitability and effect on the environmental resources of soil and water. The growing of sorghum as a summer grass in the Wimmera was also found to be an opportunity for improving productivity, profitability and sustainability by controlling winter weeds.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA:R</field><field name="subject">Sustainable agriculture Victoria Wimmera</field><field name="subject">Dry farming Victoria Wimmera</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09AFP/09afpp858.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21361861</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on weed risk assessment</field><field name="creator">Smith, Carey.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 124-136. This thesis gives an overview of factors used in weed risk assessments and explores the disparity between the measured high accuracy rate of the weed risk assessment system (WRA) as implemented in Australia and the pessimistic assessments of some workers about the possibility of predicting the weed potential of plant species imported in the future. The accuracy of the WRA may not be as high as previously thought, and it varies with weed definition and taxonomic groups. Cluster analysis and comparative analysis by independent contrasts were employed to determine the value of individual biological and ecological questions on the WRA questionnaire. Results showed that some WRA questions could be deleted from the questionnaire and the scores for others weighted differently. The WRA is not a reliable predictor of weeds when it is considered in the context of the base-rate probability of an introduced plant becoming weedy in Australia. As a result a far greater number on non-weeds will be placed on the prohibited imported list than was initially expected.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Weeds Control Australia</field><field name="subject">Questionnaires</field><field name="subject">Weeds Australia Identification</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09AFM/09afms644.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21361905</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The environmental behaviour of herbicides in Australian viticulture</field><field name="creator">Ying, Guang-guo.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 185-200.

This study was conducted to determine the etiology of a blight disease of chickpea in south-eastern Australia and the factors affecting disease development. The disease had previously been identified as phoma blight. Pathogenicity testing revealed two isolates subsequently identified as Asochyta rabiei, the first conclusive identification in the southern hemisphere. Greenhouse screening of chickpea varieties identified types resistant to ascochyta blight. The effects of plant age and environmental conditions on disease development were investigated under controlled conditions in growth rooms. Seedlings were more susceptible than older plants. The optimum conditions for ascochyta blight were 20&#176; C and a 48-96 h period of leaf wetness. Through field trials it was found that disease intensity increased over time, especially in cv. Desavic. The means of penetration of the chickpea host was established in histological studies. This study provided advance warning of this disease for the expanding chickpea industry, and has allowed the implementation of appropriate disease management strategies. It is recommended that cv.

In four other experiments, the mechanisms underlying the gross response of the broiler chicks to dietary ingredients, anti-nutritive factors and growth enhancers were examined. Results indicated that a rapid development of the small intestine preceded significant overall body growth. Body growth would, however, depend more on the various physiological events such as those related to mucosal growth and renewal, digestive enzyme function, and nutrient transport.

The main experiment compared the fungi under two P levels in soils. It was found that in soil with no added P, S. calospora depressed plant growth in the early stages, but was increased in later harvests. G. sp. "City Beach" increased plant growth throughout. In soil with added P, both sets of plants produced growth depressions at early stages. The effect on growth due to mycorrhizal symbiosis was greater in plants grown in soil with no phosphate added. There were no significant differences between the two fungi with reflexes of P across the interfaces. There were however temporal differences. The isolate of S. calospora did promote a positive plant growth response in A. porrum and transfer P to the plant. Mycorrhizal arbuscules were examined and visualised using Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope and 3D reconstructions performed.

The 152 species of mycorrhizal fungi can be difficult to identify and quantify because the taxonomy of these fungi is based on the description of spores, which is time consuming, requires considerable expertise and cannot be assumed to reflect the situation within the root. Few attempts have been made to identify the species which are present in roots. Several approaches have been identified in previous work and the development of sensitive molecular methods for identification and quantification of two species of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are described in this study.  Mycorrhizal fungal communities were sampled in both natural and agricultural ecosystems at two sites in South Australia. The combination of spore identification from trap culture and field-collected soil promises to be an effective means to study diversity of AM fungi in a particular system.

The first study investigated the temporal and spatial expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and calcium binding protein in jejunal tissue. Findings indicated the potential of estrogen to induce calbindin D28K in the intestinal tissue, from which it can be concluded that estrogen may increase calcium absorption and consequently calcium retention. It was shown that the amount of estrogen normally present in the reproductive system is sufficient for the normal capacity of egg and eggshell production. Egg production and shell quality were significantly reduced by phytoestrogen. It is recommended that the concentration of phytoestrogen in poultry diets be investigated in more detail as it may act as an anti-nutritive factor and affect metabolism and productivity.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Estrogen</field><field name="subject">Hormones in animal nutrition</field><field name="subject">Chickens Feeding and feeds</field><field name="subject">Eggs Production</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ANP/09anps158.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21362170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathology and molecular comparison of a range of pea seed-borne mosaic virus isolates</field><field name="creator">Ali, Akhtar.</field><field name="description">Copies of author's previously published articles inserted.

Accumulation of Pi in leaves of pho2 was found to reside in the symplast and was not related to Zn-deficiency. The physiology of the pho2 mutant is consistent with either a block in Pi transport in phloem from shoots to roots or an inability of shoot cells to regulate internal Pi concentration. Southern block analysis revealed that the two transporter genes, APT1 and APT2 were not responsible for the pho2 mutant.

It was found that  high and low moisture regimes had no effect on critical zinc concentration and that the value remained almost the same in all chickpea genotypes. Sensitivity of 28 chickpea genotypes were evaluated at two zinc levels. Field studies on zinc fertilization in both Australia and Pakistan showed that the application of zinc increased grain yield in all chickpea genotypes.

This study examined the fate of three common sulfonylurea herbicides in highly alkaline soils through a series of laboratory and field experiments to determine if existing leaching models could be used to describe their field behaviour under Australian climatic conditions. A liquid chromatographic method was developed to simultaneously determine levels of triasulfuron, metsulfuronmethyl, and chlorsulfuron in soil and water. The investigation of base hydrolysis for the herbicides in aqueous buffer and soil solutions determined that it was unlikely to be a major loss pathway for sulfonylureas in alkaline soils. The herbicides were found to have low sorption, very little retardation and high mobility, moving at a marginally slower rate than water. Degradation did not follow first-order kinetics, but rather a two-stage process appeared to be involved. Both VARLEACH and LEACHM models predicted the measured concentration of the herbicides reasonably well in profile under low rainfall conditions but were less adequate under high rainfall.

A series of laboratory, greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to investigate aspects of seed quality in a range of bread wheat genotypes important in South Australia as well as a durum cultivar, Yallaroi. It was concluded that sound healthy seed does vary in quality and this affects seedling vigour, crop establishment and grain yield. Seed source can affect genotype performance in evaluation trials. There is genetic variability for embryo size, coleoptile length, nutrient efficiency and nutrient loading in to the seed which can be exploited by breeders. Agronomically, seed quality can be improved by managing seed crops to aid accumulation of mineral nutrients in the seed and then selecting, by grading, only large seed for sowing.</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Wheat South Australia</field><field name="subject">Wheat Seeds</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phm933.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21387425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formation of mousy off-flavour in wine by lactic acid bacteria</field><field name="creator">Costello, Peter James.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 200-214. Three structurally related compounds, 2-acetyltetrahydropyridine (ACTPY), 2-ethyltetrahydropyridine (ETPY) and N-heterocycle, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (ACPY), were quantified and found to be unique components of mousy wines. 35 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were screened for the ability to produce mousy off-flavour. In addition to Lactobacillus brevis and L. cellobiosus, a diversity of LAB species, particularly heterofermentative Lactobacillus spp. and Oenococcus oeni exhibited this ability in a range of ethanolic and wine-based media. The substrates and metabolism of mousy compound formation by LAB were also investigated.

Bibliography: leaves 313-353. This study investigated the iron status and dietary intakes in 6-24 month old children in Australia and Ghana and assessed the effects of dietary calcium on intestinal iron absorption. The true prevalence of non-anaemic iron deficiency (NAID) and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) and dietary intakes in infants and toddlers from a broad socio-economic background were assessed by haematological and biochemical parameters, semi-quantitative diet recall and anthropometric measurements. The high prevalence of iron deficiency and anaemia found in Australian and Ghanaian children can be attributed to the low intake of bioavailable iron in weaning diets which are often ingested with large amounts of calcium. While calcium has been shown to inhibit the absorption of iron, its mechanism of interaction with iron absorption at the intestinal level is not known. The rat was used as an experimental model to investigate the effects of dietary calcium on duodenal iron uptake. The results indicate there is a critical period during weaning when the consumption of high dietary calcium with low iron can retard growth potential. Dietary calcium significantly inhibits non-haem iron absorption at the intracellular level by up-regulating villus enterocyte ferritin concentrations under iron deficiency conditions.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Iron deficiency anemia in children</field><field name="subject">Iron deficiency diseases in children</field><field name="subject">Iron Metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09pho881.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21387453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of compounds of epididymal and plant origin in maintaining viability of ram spermatozoa</field><field name="creator">Arman, Chairussyuhur.</field><field name="description">Bibliography: leaves 267-292.

Maternal protein secretions from the parthenogenetic endoparasitoid wasp Venturia canescens Gravenhorst (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) were analysed regarding their ability to protect the parasitoid egg against the host immune system. These secretions include nucleic acid-free glycoproteins, called virus-like particles (VLPs) that are produced in the ovarian calyx gland. Results found that VLP-free calyx fluid has the ability to actively suppress host defence reactions, rather than VLPs on the egg surface being solely responsible for the protection of the egg. It was shown the VLP-free calyx fluid contains serine protease-inhibitor activity capable of transiently inhibiting melanogenisis and hemocyte spreading in the host. This indicates that immediately after oviposition the egg surface is not fully protected against host defence reactions. However, at later stages the egg seems to have acquired an immunologically inert surface, and is therefore protected after the suppressive activity of the calyx fluid has disappeared.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Venturia canescens</field><field name="subject">Parasitoids</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ACP/09acpb393.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21399805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Broadcasting policy in Australia political influences and the federal government's role in the establishment and development of public/community broadcasting in Australia - a history 1939 to 1992</field><field name="creator">Thornley, Phoebe.</field><field name="description">Department of History Bibliography: leaves 387-410</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">ADCA</field><field name="subject">Broadcasting Political aspects Australia</field><field name="subject">Broadcasting Australia History</field><field name="subject">Broadcasting policy Australia History</field><field name="identifier">http://www.newcastle.edu.au/services/library/adt/public/adt-NNCU20021202.031413/index.html</field><field name="identifier">NBD:21411590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time dependent nonlinear optics using a phase conjugated laser</field><field name="creator">Kl&#246;vekorn, Patrick.</field><field name="description">Copies of author's previously published works inserted.

This thesis investigates change in secondary schools in South Australia during the 1970s. Public concern about the purposes and organization of schools, and about education in general led to the establishment of a government enquiry in 1969, chaired by Peter Karmel. Its report, Education in South Australia, ushered in a period of rapid change. High schools and technical high schools were reshaped into comprehensive secondary schools. A significant element in this reform was the human capitalist idea that education is an investment in the development of the individual resulting in social and economic progress. This thesis examines the human capitalist basis of the reforms, the way in which child-centred open ideas were used in the reform of the curriculum and the impact of these on the schools.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Education, Secondary South Australia</field><field name="subject">Education, Secondary South Australia Curricula</field><field name="subject">High schools South Australia Curricula</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09EDM/09edmw752.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:22487891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematics and biogeography of hyptiogastrine wasps (Hymenoptera: Gasteruptiidae)</field><field name="creator">Jennings, John T.</field><field name="description">Copies of six of the author's  previously published articles  in pocket inside back cover.

This study describes the development of a new technique to measure child mouthing behaviour with regard to dust- and soil-based contaminant hazards. Previously, mouthing behaviour has been assessed by three methods: a questionnaire addressed to the parents of the child, researchers observing the child on an ad hoc basis in the home, or videotaped behaviour in a prefabricated environment where the child is given set tasks. The new technique involves "Parents Observing their children through Time Sampling" (POTS). The POTS method was developed in the lead smelting town of Port Pirie, South Australia. The POTS method of measuring child mouthing behaviour was readily accepted and completed by parents, reliable in terms of internal consistency across observers and correlated well with the other three methods of measurement.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09MPM/09mpmb858.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:22681198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study on the biochemical and physiological basis for resistance to paraquat in Arctotheca calendula (L.)

Fieldwork was conducted at Karu Tji&#7739;pi Tju&#7791;aku (Ten Mile Crrek Elders' Bush Camp) north of Coober Pedy.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Yankunytjatjara language</field><field name="subject">Yankunytjatjara (Australian people) Ethnic identity</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09ARM/09armn144.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:22732695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Papers submitted by H.C.

This thesis uses a feminist framework to explore one aspect of violence against women - the alienation that has occurred between women and their children. The thesis concludes that maternal alienation is built on two foundations, the privileging of the male voice, and the extensive mother blaming present at macro and micro levels in cultural discourses and in families. It suggests that maternal alienation is one way in which children are initiated into and coached in dismissive and blaming attitudes and behaviours to women.

Includes bibliography. V. I: text -- v. IIa: Figures -- v. IIb: Figures. This thesis demonstrates the falsity of the assumptions that ancient architects followed innate spatial cues or responses in their designs, that ancient people experienced the resulting buildings through the same responses, and that modern scholars can thus reconstruct both the intentions of the ancient architects and the architectural effects experienced by ancient visitors to ancient buildings throught the medium of their own spatial reactions. This underlying belief is contestable given its basis in unproven and untested late nineteenth century theories of perception. The thesis also demonstrates that the assumption made by modern scholars that the architects of the Forum of Pompeii were primarily concerned with uniformly enclosed space, axial symmetry, and orthogonality, is wrong, and is contradicted by the actual form of the buildings around the Forum.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation">SUA</field><field name="subject">Architecture, Ancient Italy Pompeii (Extinct city)</field><field name="subject">Perspective</field><field name="subject">Mural painting and decoration, Roman Italy Pompeii (Extinct city)</field><field name="subject">Forum (Pompeii)</field><field name="identifier">http://web4.library.adelaide.edu.au/theses/09PH/09phh161.pdf</field><field name="identifier">NBD:22864134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The architecture of colonisation : the concept of depiction : Colon : the colonisation of a(a)rchitecture : the depiction of the concept</field><field name="creator">McFeat Lin, Gillian.</field><field name="description">Includes bibliography.

The full-length human $/beta/sb7$ cDNA contains 2798 nucleotides encoding a single long open reading frame of 798 amino acid residues of which 708 are extracellular and 52 are cytoplasmic. The human $/beta/sb7$ sequence displays strong homology with other integrin $/beta$ subunits, being most related to $/beta/sb2$. Cell distribution studies suggest that the expression of transcripts encoding the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit is restricted to leukocytes. This study was the first to show that the cysteine-rich repeats of the human integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit and other integrin $/beta$ subunits are related to domain III of the laminin B chains. Furthermore, the integrin $/beta$ subunit and laminin cysteine-rich repeats are each related to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats found in a growing number of adhesion molecules and regulatory proteins.    The mouse homologue of the human $/beta/sb7$ subunit has also been cloned in this study, and it shares 87% amino acid identity with the human $/beta/sb7$ sequence. The mouse $/beta/sb7$ mRNA transcripts, like that of the human $/beta/sb7$, have a predominantly leukocyte-restricted expression, but in some haematopoietic lineage cell lines, in addition to the predominant 3 kb transcript, a less abundant 2 kb transcript is also detectable. Cultured mouse skin epithelial cells contain only the 2 kb transcript.    The genes encoding the human and mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunits were mapped to human chromosome 12 (ITGB7) and mouse chromosome 15 (Itgb-7). The Itgb-7 gene was localised to the distal part of mouse chromosome 15, and exists in the gene order: Myc-Wnt-1-Itgb-1.    The N-terminal 13 amino acids of the mature mouse $/beta/sb7$ subunit was shown to be identical to a 13 amino acid N-terminal sequence reported for the Mr 120,000 $/beta$ subunit of the M290 antigen, which is found highly expressed on mouse intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). This finding suggests that the integrin $/beta/sb7$ subunit may play important roles in IEL migration, and immunosurveillance in the gut mucosa.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, IMMUNOLOGY (0982)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Molecular Medicine)--University of Auckland, 1991.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/10</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On the ontogeny and phylogeny of the representational mind</field><field name="creator">Suddendorf, Thomas</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes a theory for fundamental aspects of the evolution and development of the representational mind. Building on Perner's (1991) theory of representational development, it is suggested that mind evolved from the ability to represent current reality (primary mind) to further entertain secondary representations of hypothetical content (collating mind) to finally represent representational relations themselves (metamind). In child development these transitions can be observed by about 18 months and by about 42 to 48 months. In comparative analysis only the great apes show signs of a collating mind. Young children and great apes can, for example, pretend, consider a limited future and past, solve problems by insight, and consider others' basic mental states. By about age four children begin to show evidence for metarepresentation in their ability to pass theory-of-mind tasks. At about the same age they also gain considerable executive control which, together with metarepresentation, is the key cognitive advance of metamind. Empirical evidence suggests that various skills co-develop with metamind and the thesis includes four studies that investigate such associations. It was found that gestural representation with imaginary objects and the generation of creative problem solutions were robustly correlated with theory-of-mind measures. These results substantiate the claim for a domain-general change in cognitive ability by about age four. Understanding delayed video feedback, however, was not found to correlate with such measures and it is questioned whether delayed feedback tasks measure an extended sense of self as has been proposed (Povinelli, 1995; Suddendorf &amp; Corballis, 1997). Great apes, while showing evidence for a collating mind, have not yet provided any convincing evidence for metamind. It is thus suggested that metamind developed after the split from the line that led to modern chimpanzees about five million years ago. Metamind, it is argued, was a prime mover in human phylogeny and is a crucial step in human ontogeny.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Semiotics and the discourse of architecture</field><field name="creator">Walker, Paul Joseph</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses a problematic of meaning and of semiotics in architecture by considering a number of questions. Why have meaning and semiotics been of concern in architectural discourse? How did semiotics enter that discourse? How does it operate there?    The first chapter explores the notion of meaning in art, assuming this to have bearing on meaning in architecture. Functionalism is investigated as an implicitly semantic view of architecture: it is proposed that it is the failure of functionalism in practice which underlies the recent concern with meaning.    Chapter 2 introduces the work of eight semioticians: Saussure, Peirce, Morris, Mukarovsky, Jakobson, Levi-Strauss, Barthes, and Eco.    Chapter 3 poses the question of why semiotics has been attractive to architects. Attention is given to Tafuri's notion that semiotics serves both to bolster the current status of architecture (by blockading investigation of its discursive characteristics) and as radial criticism. Work by Norberg-Schulz and by Jencks is shown to be blockade; that by Agrest and Gandelsonas more nearly critical. It is proposed that semiotics and the discourse of modern architecture are epistemologically analogous, which circumstance has facilitated and been conditional to the entry of semiotics into architecture.    The fourth chapter examines Eco's and Preziosi's rigorous semiotic theories of the built. Both have been posited, however, as theories of architecture; as such they impede rather than foster theorizing with respect to architectural discourse.    Chapter 5 assumes a (semiotic) model of architecture as a hierarchy of codes (building, language, drawing, photography). The role of language in architecture is shown to be more important than is generally conceded. Architectural discourse is also shown to be dependent on photography, and, by implication, on other graphic modes.    While bearing in mind the links between the postmodern and radical strains of semiotics, the final chapter surveys architecture in culture's present postmodern moment. If the problematic of meaning in architecture has been motivated by the 'emptiness' of the built world constructed under the aegis of functional architecture, this problematic cannot be taken as a recuperation. Rather, the advent of semiotics in the discourse of architecture may signify its transposition to an unknown discursive configuration.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Architecture)--University of Auckland, 1986.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing the "other" : on being a man and a nurse</field><field name="creator">Harding, Thomas S</field><field name="description">This study explores the experiences of men who are nurses in Aotearoa New Zealand. Utilising discourse analysis a social constructionist reading of men, masculinity and nursing is provided to offer an alternative reading to much of the extant literature with respect to men in nursing. The study draws upon a number of different sources of "text", including over 600 written works, two films and interviews with eighteen men who currently are, have been or are intending to be, nurses. Drawing primarily upon the "literary" textual sources a number of themes were identified for further exploration in interview with the coresearchers. These themes were the construction of masculinity, the construction of images of the nurse, the reaction to men who are nurses, sexuality issues, career development, and men and caring. The findings of this thesis reveal that the literature pertaining to men in nursing is replete with paradox and contradiction and fails to adequately account for the male experience. It is argued that the images and arguments provided in the literature with respect to men in nursing are based on out-of-date models and understandings of gender relations, masculinity and nursing. It is suggested that rather than enjoying patriarchal privilege, men who enter nursing must contend with being constructed as both an inferior man and inferior nurse. Their careers are not, as is alleged in the literature, based on developing "islands of masculinity" and male privilege, nor upon the avoidance of the emotional labour of nursing but reflect a belief that career is one way of doing care. It is argued in this work that men in nursing have fewer "taken-as-givens" upon which to base work and that they work to develop trusting relationships with their patients that are based on communication and empathy within a context defined by the patients' circumstances.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Nursing (0569)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Nursing)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation and assessment of a new integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of a safety intervention in a complex socio-technological workplace</field><field name="creator">Webster, Craig Stephen</field><field name="description">The rate of injury and death inadvertently caused by medical treatment is too high and exacts enormous human and financial costs. Each year in Britain and the United States alone, hundreds of thousands of patients are injured, ten of thousands are killed and billions of dollars are spent on additional health care due to iatrogenic harm. Health care organisations remain predominately human-centred in their approach to safety-that is, methods of avoiding error rely primarily on the resolve and vigilance of individual clinicians to avoid bad outcomes. However, this approach is becoming increasingly inadequate in the face of the steadily rising complexity of modern health care and the increasing number of procedures carried out each year. In other high-reliability organisations such as aviation and nuclear power generation, safety results not from the sheer effort of &#8220;operators&#8221;, but from in-depth analysis of problems and the removal and redesign of dangerous aspects of systems-the so-called systems approach. Here I present an evaluation of the integrated drug administration system (IDAS) as an example of the systems approach, intended to reorganise the way in which anaesthetists give drugs to improve performance and facilitate safe practice. The problem of drug error in anaesthesia is an important subset of iatrogenic harm in medicine. From the prospective study of 10806 conventional anaesthetics I define the rate of drug error in anaesthesia as one error in every 133 anaesthetics conducted-a rate five times higher than anything previously reported. In addition, anaesthetists rated the risk of harming a patient through drug error in the course of their career as high. I discuss the principles of safe system design, the psychology of error, and advanced systems safety concepts with respect to the design of the IDAS and the future of safety in medicine. In clinical use, the IDAS saved time before and during anaesthesia, and was rated by anaesthetists as significantly safer and more useable than conventional methods of drug administration. This work supports the hypothesis that error in anaesthesia can be reduced through the systematic analysis of its causes and the implementation of appropriate countermeasure strategies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PHARMACOLOGY (0419)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY (0354)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Network strategy in the New Zealand wine industry : how firms in an industry understand and use their business relationships</field><field name="creator">Benson-Rea, Maureen</field><field name="description">Network strategy in the New Zealand wine industry: how firms in an industry understand and use their business relationshipsThis theory-building study offers new theoretical explanations for how and why companies within a case industry use relationships in their strategies. Using qualitative data from multiple case studies within the New Zealand wine industry, the thesis captures and explains the strategic heterogeneity of diverse patterns of relationships and network interactions and how these are used strategically. Drawing on strategic management and business network theory, it emphasises how firms value their relationships in strategy, that is, how they contribute to strategy formation process and realisation outcomes. The study builds new interpretations and extends theory through in-depth exploration, providing two extensive typologies of relationships, one categorised according to the range of relationships, their functions, content and contribution to strategy, and another according to strategies and how relationships are used in their realisation. A model of relationship drivers in strategy is then developed, tested, and refined to show the purposes and outcomes of relationships and clarify the processes and conditions under which they arise and are used within an industry. The data support converging assumptions in strategic management and business network theory on the connectedness of firms in business relationships and the embeddedness of economic action in ongoing ties within social structures. Concepts of intentionality and emergence are used to show that emergence primarily arises out of intentionality.Understanding of relationships was based on the historically collective nature of the industry, on personal values, experience or approaches to relationships, on firm level strategy, especially decisions around grow, buy or connect options, and whether the firm aimed to control resources and activities internally or used relationships to achieve strategic goals. Firms focused on (in order of priority): resource-based input requirements, activity-based capability related strategies and actor-based values and these inputs operated at three levels which, singly or in combination, drove the diverse use of relationships: firm level strategy influences, relationship level influences and industry environment level influences. Two frameworks emerge which have strong explanatory power. One models how firms understanding and value placed on relationships is integrated into strategy processes. Another integrates concepts in a new way to show the main pathways through ways of understanding relationship development and use in strategy.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Strategy ; International Business ; Marketing</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Marketing)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Resilience against stress and depression in the postpartum period</field><field name="creator">Thio, Irene Marie</field><field name="description">Background. Because there have been few studies examining resilience associated with postnatal (PN) depression, this study aimed at formulating and testing a theory-based model integrating both traditional resilience paradigms and non-traditional factors including existential beliefs about life, motherhood and religion.    Method. Study hypotheses addressed prediction of PN depression, stress and resilience, and the confounding influence of negative affectivity (neuroticism). Study variables included PN depression (Edinburgh PN Depression Scale, EPDS), stress, neuroticism, self-esteem, mother's distress and ambivalence, purpose/meaning, religious belief, parity, age, marital and social status. They were assessed with standardized self-report instruments and, following a pilot, administered to a probability sample of women four months postpartum in a one-wave, community, postal survey. Because the overall response rate was so low (49%) only the Europeans were included in the study (N = 225; response-rate = 78%). Statistical hypothesis-testing included linear and logistical multivariate model-twilding techniques, and principal components analysis.    Results. Sixteen percent scored in the major depression range (EPDS &gt; 12), and 14% in the minor depression range. Depression was associated with stress, neuroticism, purpose/meaning, mother's distress and (marginally) religious belief, but not with self-esteem, mother's ambivalence, age, parity or social class. Although neuroticism was strongly associated with depression, and also overlapped with most psycho-social variables, nonetheless stress, purpose/meaning, and mother's distress maintained significant relationships with depression after neuroticism was statistically controlled. Stress was associated in part with the perception of losing one's freedom in the motherhood role (neuroticism controlled). When resilience was defined as high stress coupled with low depression, it was associated with low levels of neuroticism and mother's distress. When resilience was defined in terms of high levels of maternal satisfaction, it was associated with high purpose and low ambivalence. Principal components analyses revealed that (1) stress scores reflected two dimensions suggestive of distress and self-efficacy; and (2) depression, stress, neuroticism, self-esteem and purpose were markers for the same underlying component, whereas mother's distress and ambivalence were markers for another (unrelated) component.    Conclusion. This study underlines the relevance of temperament, self-efficacy, self-transcendence, existential beliefs and motherhood-related cogniitions to the understanding of PN depression and stress.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PERSONALITY (0625)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MENTAL HEALTH (0347)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychiatry)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of the New Zealand monarchy:  The recognition of an autochthonous polity</field><field name="creator">Cox, Noel Stanley Bertie</field><field name="description">The aims of this thesis are to determine to what extent the Crown remains important as a source of legitimacy for the constitutional order and as a focus of sovereignty; how the Crown has developed as a distinct institution; and what the prospects are for the adoption of a republican form of government in New Zealand.    The imperial Crown has evolved into the New Zealand Crown, yet the implications of this change are as yet only slowly being understood. Largely this is because that evolution came about as a result of gradual political development, as part of an extended process of independence, rather than by deliberate and conscious decision.    The continuing evolution of political independence does not necessarily mean that New Zealand will become a republic in the short-to-medium term. This is for various reasons. The concept of the Crown has often been, in New Zealand, of greater importance than the person of the Sovereign, or that of the Governor-General. The existence of the Crown has also contributed to, rather than impeded, the independence of New Zealand, through the division of imperial prerogative powers. In particular, while the future constitutional status of the Treaty of Waitangi remains uncertain, the Crown appears to have acquired greater legitimacy through being a party to the Treaty. The expression of national identity does not necessarily require the removal of the Crown.    The very physical absence of the Sovereign, and the all-pervading nature of the legal concept of the Crown, have also contributed to that institution's development as a truly national organ of government. The concept of the Crown has now, to a large extent, been separated from its historical, British, roots. This has been encouraged by conceptual confusion over the symbolism and identity of the Crown. But this merely illustrates the extent to which the Crown has become an autochthonous polity, grounded in our own unique settlement and evolution since 1840. Whether that conceptual strength is sufficient to counterbalance symbolic and other challenges in the twenty-first century remains uncertain. But it is certain that the Crown has had a profound affect upon the style and structure of government in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, GENERAL (0615)</field><field name="subject">LAW (0398)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">Legal history</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">International law</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political Studies)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A conceptual model for sustainability (John Berger)</field><field name="creator">Wanden-Hannay (nee Witten-Hannah), Shalema</field><field name="description">The ideas of Berger are used in this thesis to explore humankind's struggle to achieve greater sustainability. In his descriptions of the peasantry and modern high-energy cultures of progress Berger insightfully crystallises and represents graphically the observation made by many authors writing in different contexts and from within various disciplines that there have been two fundamentally different systems of beliefs and values in history. His conception of &#8216; cultures of survival&#8217; and &#8216;cultures of progress &#8217; is used in this thesis to develop a conceptual model for sustainability.    The basic idea underlying the conceptual model for sustainability is that cultural systems self-regulate or self-correct as they strive to achieve balance in their relationship to higher systems levels of the biosphere, while improving quality of life. Over large time scales self-regulation takes the form of quite radical transformations in cultural system's key defining beliefs and values. The model holds that the process of self-regulation results in societies moving back and forth along a cultural continuum of beliefs and values, represented at one end by Berger's cultures of survival and at the other by his cultures of progress. This system of self-regulation is fraught with risks arising from factors like the inherently conservative nature of cultural systems, which reduce the fit or alignment between systems of beliefs and values and their context and in doing so generate un-sustainability. The model suggests that over large spans of time movement back and forth along the cultural continuum creates the dynamic balance needed to achieve greater sustainability, at least if irreversible degradation of the biosphere's life-supporting systems and extinction can be avoided. This conceptual model for sustainability demonstrates the validity of the central hypothesis of the thesis, which is that Berger's ideas in the &#8216;Historical Afterword&#8217; to &#8216;Pig Earth&#8217; are important and have a valuable contribution to make to the discourse on sustainability.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES (0768)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Planning)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/11</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The negotiation of meaning by advanced ESL learners: the effects of individual learner factors and task type</field><field name="creator">Bitchener, John</field><field name="description">During the last two decades, SLA researchers have given much attention to investigating the role that negotiated interaction plays in second language learning. Empirical research has demonstrated that the negotiation of meaning that occurs when communication difficulties arise may provide learners with opportunities to receive comprehensible input, provide feedback on form and meaning, and assist them in their production of modified output. While the short-term and long-term effects of negotiation on SLA are currently being examined, there is considerable evidence to suggest that the negotiation of meaning can facilitate the language learning process. From a pedagogical perspective, numerous studies have shown the effect that individual learner, task and context variables can have on promoting opportunities for negotiation. While some attention has been given to the effects of individual learner variables like ethnicity, gender and pairing, and to task and contextual variables on L2 negotiation, their effect on advanced learners has been little researched. This study examined the effect of three individual learner variables (ethnicity, gender and pairing) and certain communication tasks (free conversation and decision-making) on the way in which advanced ESL learners (Japanese and Korean males and females in monoethnic and interethnic dyads) repair communication problems and use the process of negotiation in their language learning. The study revealed that task was the only variable to affect the amount of negotiated repair: free conversation produced more negotiation than the decision making tasks. While monoethnic dyads provided more target language feedback than interethnic dyads, monoethnic and male dyads modified fewer trigger utterances than interethnic and female dyads. Korean subjects, particularly Korean males, modified more of their utterances when responding to feedback than the other subject groupings. Factors that may have accounted for the limited effect of the three individual learner variables include the insufficiently differentiated sociocultural and sociolinguistic background of the subjects and their perception of appropriate behaviour in L2 interactions. On the other hand, motivational and contextual factors appear to have resulted in the significant effect produced by the task variable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Second Language Teaching and Learning)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reproductive Biology of Pohutukawa (Metrosideros Excelsa) (Myrtaceae)</field><field name="creator">Schmidt-Adam, Gabriele Hedwig Julia</field><field name="description">The objective of this project is to describe and analyse the reproductive biology of pohutukawa, by integrating information from floral biology, breeding system and pollination biology. New Zealand pohutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa Sol. ex Gaertn). a member of the Myrtaceae, is a mass-flowering tree endemic to northern New Zealand coastlines. Compound inflorescences develop over a period of ten weeks in six morphologically distinct stages. Trees flower over a peak period of two weeks, and the inflorescences contain an average of 14.3 large, hermaphrodite, red 'brush' flowers that remain open for seven days. Most pollen is viable (93.6%) and the receptivity of the wet-papillate stigma extends for at least nine days. Each flower produces approximately 46 &#956;L nectar per day, containing l8% (w/v) sucrose. Neither dichogamy nor herkogamy prevent pollen and stigma interference, and floral design and display are consistent with high levels of autogamous and geitonogamous self-pollination. The stigmatic exudate of unpollinated pistils stains intensely for carbohydrates, lipids and proteins, but shows a notable decrease in lipids and proteins following pollination. The style has a solid transmitting tissue with large mucilage-filled intercellular spaces which stain weakly for polyanions and pectins irrespective of pollination. Although starch grains in the stylar cortex are depleted following pollination, stylar resources in general appear to be sparse and this results in a low speed of pollen tubes (2 mm / d) through the intercellular spaces of the transmitting tissue. Seed capsules of pohutukawa contain a mixture of fertile (embryo-containing) and infertile (embryo-lacking) seeds. Fertile seeds weigh approximately 0.15 mg. stain positively with 1% tetrazolium chloride, and are randomly disposed on the placenta. Their germination rate exceeds 90% after up to one year of cold storage, but decreases rapidly when stored at room temperature. Controlled pollinations with self- and cross-pollen from single donors and a pollen mixture from five unrelated parents showed that seven out of ten trees were self-incompatible, suggesting that natural populations may consist of a mosaic of self-incompatible and self-compatible individuals. Self-incompatibility is late-acting as pollen tubes from selfs and crosses reach the ovary simultaneously l0 - 15 d after pollination. In common with other Myrtaceae, the seed / ovule ratio in pohutukawa is low and not limited by the stigmatic pollen load. The pollen / ovule ratio of 462.5 (SE &#177;43.4) places the breeding system of pohutukawa between facultative selfing and facultative outcrossing. Mainland populations of pohutukawa have been reduced to fragmented stands, and the original suite of bird pollinators has been largely replaced by introduced species. In contrast, the native pollinator fauna of several offshore islands remains intact, including the three species of the New Zealand honey eaters (Meliphagidae) and solitary bees. Using allozyme analyses. multilocus outcrossing rates were estimated for Little Barrier Island and Tiritiri Matangi Island and for three mainland populations in comparison. They were among the lowest in the Myrtaceae (tm = 0.22 - 0.53) and the loss of native pollinators has no measurable effect on the mating system. Although there is no difference in the germination percentage of fertile seeds from self- and cross-pollination treatments (98.4%), 'selfed' seedlings show marked inbreeding depression in height after six months. Wright's fixation index is consistently higher for seedlings (Fs) than for mothers (Fm) in all populations, indicating that selection may eliminate selfed offspring from populations prior to reproductive maturity. Exclusion experiments were undertaken on Little Barrier Island to assess the effect of native birds and bees on outcrossing and seed production. In bird exclusion experiments in the lower canopy (2 - 4 m) with flower access to bees only, estimated outcrossing rates were lower (tm = 0.40) than in open pollination (tm = 0.58), suggesting that bees effect more self-pollination than birds. The highest outcrossing rates (tm = 0.71) were found for open pollination in the upper canopy (&gt; 4 m). Numbers of fertile seeds per capsule were 45% higher after open pollination than in treatments with bee visitation only, and 28% higher than in treatments where all flower visitors were excluded. The results suggest that native bees visiting pohutukawa flowers reduce seed set and effect less outcrossing than birds, and that a large proportion of seeds arises from automatic self-pollination. In trees of a modified mainland population with predominantly introduced birds and a mixture of introduced and native bees there was no decrease in seed set for the treatment allowing flower access by bees only, indicating that - in contrast to native bees - honeybees did not reduce seed set in pohutukawa. In conclusion, although the floral biology of pohutukawa permits geitonogamy, a combination of outcrossing (predominantly by bird pollinators), self-incompatibility, and inbreeding depression act to maintain heterozygosity and result in the production of sufficient offspring that will ensure the survival of the species.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1102</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial Assessment and Hazard Modeling of Tropical Forest Fires</field><field name="creator">Ofren, Rey S</field><field name="description">This research study offers a quantitative understanding of the environmental factors related to fire occurrence and its potential distribution. The Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, located in the northwestern region of Thailand, serves as an example to analyze and expand the knowledge base of forest fire ecology in tropical environments. Specific objectives focus on establishing the relationship between physiognomic variables that are related to forest fuel loading among different forest types. In addition, this study aims at modeling and quantifying the relative importance of the biophysical variables associated with the occurrence of tropical forest fires. The methodological framework links Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with the potential of statistical analysis. Thematic layers of several biophysical variables are combined in GIS, along with field measurements of fuel loading and stand physiognomy. Under the statistical analysis, the variability and interactions of spatial attributes related to fires are synthesized using the Decision Tree modeling. GIS is further employed to display the modeling results. Rainfall pattern, geological material, aspect and vegetation index variables significantly influence the ability of the Decision Tree model to predict the likely occurrence of fire. They explain most of the processes underlying a hierarchical set of rules that help to distinguish the varying levels of fire hazards. The vegetation index in particular was found to be a strong potential indicator of fire incidents and an underlying driving factor behind fuel moisture dynamics. At a certain vegetation index, two types of forest were distinguished as having wet and dry fuel conditions. The difference in the amount of fuel load between the physiognomically distinct evergreen and deciduous forests is proven to be insignificant, except in the variation of moisture content. Factors contributing to the varying levels of fuel moisture in evergreen forests are controlled by the micro-climate created by its intact crown cover. However, there is no distinct relationship concerning the stand structure of deciduous forest with regard to the dryness of fuel on its floor. The dominance of weather over the fuel variables suggests that forest fire situations in an open and dry stand of deciduous forest is driven by extreme weather conditions. A GlS-generated map of the sanctuary illustrates the spatial variation in fire hazard probabilities as predicted by the Decision Tree model. The prediction accuracy of fire hazard zones based on bio-physical factors is further enhanced by incorporating the proportion of neighbouring areas with high potential for ignition. The potential combustibility and danger rating are determined for the predicted hazard zones. In addition, the spatial association of the neighbouring human settlements is analyzed. This research expands the value of GIS from the usual selective retrieval and investigation of spatial patterns into the evaluation of the complex hierarchical combinations of spatial attributes. The combined effect of GIS and statistical modeling eliminates the problems of handling a mixture of environmental data and identifying both variables and attributes interactions. Likewise, the need to design site-specific fire managemet strategies, as guided by particular combinations of environmental attributes, takes into account the applicability of the data-driven Decision Tree modeling.

The monitoring requirements of the audit contract should be reflected in the audit fee. In this thesis, I use Simunic's (1980) fee model to investigate three questions regarding the determinants of audit pricing. First, auditors have the incentive to earn fee premiums (quasi-rents) by developing specialised monitoring skills that address the needs of industries with a differentiated demand for monitoring. Three classifications of differentiated monitoring are developed to investigate whether fee premiums are earned on those audits. Fee premiums are shown to be earned by Big Seven auditors over non-Big Seven auditors, but the null hypothesis that industry specialist auditors do not earn fee premiums over non-specialists is not rejected. The incentive to earn quasi-rents in future fees provides a rationale for auditors to bid a reduced audit fee in order to gain incumbency (DeAngelo, 1981a). The second research question uses a sample of audit fees from the first financial statements after listing to test for reduced fees on initial audits. Results indicate that audit fees for the first financial statements after listing are lower than the level of audit fee for existing companies. Negotiation of audit fees may be affected by professional regulation. The third research question investigates whether abandonment of a fee scale by the professional accounting body in New Zealand influenced the general level of audit fees. The results fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference in fees before and after abandonment of the fee scale. The incentive to develop industry-specialised monitoring skills may be replaced, in a small country, by alternate audit practice development strategies; for example, diversification of an audit portfolio in order to spread risk. Auditor brand name, reflecting technical skills, may thus earn a fee premium in preference to industry specialist skills. A final limitation of this work arises from the time period of interest (1985-87), a time of change in New Zealand's business environment, in which audit fee determinants may be subject to effects not captured in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Accounting and Finance)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fractal modelling of turbulent surface-layer winds</field><field name="creator">Lauren, Michael Kyle</field><field name="description">Multiscaling analysis and cascade simulation techniques, which form part of the more general field of fractals, are introduced as a method for characterising and simulating surface-layer winds, particularly for time scales associated with the energy-containing range. This type of analysis consists of determining the power-law parameter of the spectrum of the data, and the scaling of the statistical moments. These techniques were applied to determine how the statistics depended on the duration (or scale) of the fluctuations in wind speed, the atmospheric conditions, and the topography of the site. It was found that the parameterisations produced using multiscaling analysis characterised differences in the statistics for each of these cases. Furthermore, the fractal cascade simulation techniques used provided simple methods for reproducing these statistics. This analysis is followed by an investigation into the robustness of some of these results. In particular, the data is examined for the existence of self-similar distributions of the cascade weighting factor, W. Such self-similar analysis allows the direct simulation of the data via a cascade. Cascade models have the virtue of being able to reproduce statistical properties such as intermittency, and in particular, the nesting of intermittency from different wavenumber bands in the same region of space. The existence of these properties in both the experimental and simulated data is investigated, with consideration given to the consequence of the results for simulation techniques. One notable discovery is the failure of these methods to reproduce the bias in the distribution of the gradients in the wind velocity field. This result has important implications for all workers dealing with simulation of geophysical data by fractal cascades. Finally, a brief numerical experiment is carried out to both demonstrate how this bias may be exploited to construct a model, and to test some of the analysis techniques presented on non-cascade based data. While not a particularly convincing simulator of turbulence, the model nevertheless displays some interesting turbulence-like characteristics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contrastive rhetoric, lexico-grammatical knowledge, writing expertise, and metacognitive knowledge: An integrated account of the development of English writing by Taiwanese students (China)</field><field name="creator">Chao, Yu-Chuan Joni</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to draw together various perspectives into a coherent framework that will identify relative importance of respective factors and developmental changes in accounting for second language (L2) writing.

Analyses of lexical use and errors in English compositions, plus results from the assessment of two vocabulary tests, indicated that lexical and grammatical knowledge was a critical factor in explaining English writing. Results of students' Chinese writing abilities in relation to English writing proficiency revealed that the transfer of Chinese writing expertise was conditioned by a developed Chinese expertise and a lack of English writing experiences. Findings from the written-speech analysis of English essays suggested a transitional development whereby spoken language was used. Analyses of questionnaires indicated that EFL writing was positively related to attention on the macro-level structure and negatively related to micro-level concerns.    Subsequently, integrated analyses were conducted to examine the interplay among these factors. The shared variability of factors contributed a much larger portion to the explanation of developmental changes, suggesting that the development of EFL writing involves the interaction among influencing factors much more than the individual factors themselves. The unique contributions (independent of other interrelated variables) showed that essay length outweighed the other predictors, suggesting a need for instruction to develop the skill of fluency. A determining factor that consistently accounted for English writing performance was the students' levels of English learning and English writing experiences. The implication is that, particularly in the context where writing is neglected for beginning or intermediate learners, there is a need to revitalize writing as a communicative skill in the EFL curriculum.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Housing and health (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Asaad, Eman</field><field name="description">A belief based on a personal experience that asthma incidence in New Zealand is interrelated with the indoor environment, led the author to establish the study between asthma and housing.    A considerable period of time was spent first on studying the roots of the two issues, asthma and New Zealand housing. The historical experience showed that health and housing problems at the national level in the 19 th century in England were solved by state interference.    The architectural background of this study created a need to cover some medical knowledge to understand the causes, symptoms and cure of asthma, if any. This knowledge was crucial while monitoring houses, designing the questionnaire, and analysing results.    Two stages of monitoring were achieved in 2000 and 2001. In addition to the monitoring, there was an attempt to find out as much information as possible about any issues related to the health conditions, especially the respiratory disorders, and the houses. The study of housing included building construction, house dust mite allergen levels in the carpet, building drawings, and other issues in preparation for the next stage of analysis.    The overwhelming quantity of information gathered about the 30 houses investigated in 2000 was so confusing that no statistical software package was seen as a perfect way for analysing it. It was decided then to establish comparisons between each factor investigated and asthma presence. Also, in most of the cases, the correlation between more than one factor with asthma rates was examined.    The investigation of the relations between many issues and asthma showed that there were links between asthma incidence and some indoor conditions of houses. Raised timber floors, which were found in most of the houses to be un-insulated, and in all the cases to be on unprotected ground, were found to have a strong relation with asthma incidence. In these houses, it was found that high asthma incidence was related to a higher level of moisture indoors. Asthma incidence in houses having old carpet, moulds, pets, or smokers indoors was higher than asthma incidence in houses without these. Old houses were found to have more asthma incidence than new houses. All the allergen levels in the carpets were extremely high and they were all above the allergen levels induced by house dust mites that can provoke asthma in susceptible individuals.    Based on the knowledge gained about the defective factors in housing affecting asthma, upgrading of the houses was designed. A house was chosen to be upgraded in three stages, each stage providing a different level of insulation. The upgrading costs were compared with the current national costs of health and heating to see what level of upgrading would be logical and cost-effective. National costs and savings were estimated in four cases each with different level of insulation. It was decided at the final stage of the study that insulating ceilings and floors in addition to other basic upgrading factors would provide savings in health and heating costs and would result in less CO2 emissions to the atmosphere of New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ARCHITECTURE (0729)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Architecture)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/112</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand English language periodicals of literary interest active 1920s-1960s</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Stephen Derek</field><field name="description">The primary objective of this thesis is to provide an account of New Zealand literary magazine activity from the 1920s to the 1960s. While a focus is maintained on the fifteen year period between the appearance of the first issue of Phoenix in March 1932 and the advent of Landfall, the thesis examines several magazines whose issue runs extend well outside that period. The thesis is divided into two volumes, the first of which, in Chapters Two through Five, provides a detailed survey of the four most important periodicals published entirely within the period selected for this study: Phoenix (1932-1933), Tomorrow (1934-1940), Book (1941-1947), and New Zealand New Writing (1942-1945). Chapter Six concludes Volume One with a survey of the numerous university based periodicals, including several published entirely outside the focal period of the study. In Volume Two, Chapters Seven to Nine discuss, in order, the Auckland family magazine the Mirror (1922-1963), the national magazine of the arts Art in New Zealand (1928-1946), and the travel journal the Near Zealand Railways Magazine (1926-1940). All three of these publications are of significance as early sites for the development in New Zealand of the popular fiction genres of romance, adventure and mystery. Chapter Ten deals with a range of minor little magazines, including the New Zealand Mercury (1933-1936), Quill (1934-1948), Anvil (1945-1946), Chapbook (1945-1950), Oriflamme: A Literary Journal (1939-1942), and those edited, printed and published by Noel Farr Hoggard: Spilt Ink (1932-1937), New Triad (1937-1942), Letters (1943-1946), and Arena'(1946-1972). Appendix I supplies an annotated bibliography of the fifty-two periodicals discussed in the body of the thesis. These annotations are supplemented with author indexes for those periodicals not already indexed by earlier researchers. Appendix II compares the text of Allen Curnow's 1939 prose and poetry sequence Not in Narrow Seas with an early version of the sequence published in Tomorrow between June 1937 and August 1938.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1146</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The coexistence of DS-CDMA mobile radio systems and fixed services</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Philip John</field><field name="description">Analytical techniques are developed for predicting the performance of outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems and fixed services sharing the same spectrum. The mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics are represented by a log-normally distributed distance dependent path-loss. For simplicity, the received signal variability attributable to multi-path fading is ignored.    The mobile radio system performance is estimated using outage probability expressions, where an outage is defined to occur when the momentary BER exceeds a specified threshold rate. The in-building and outdoor mobile radio systems are assumed to use power control and the composite interference is assumed to be Gaussian distributed at the mobile radio receivers.    Outage probability expressions which predict the performance of a fixed service sharing spectrum with a mobile radio system are developed. The fixed service is assumed to experience occasional multi-path fading attributable to unusual tropospheric conditions. The maximum tolerable mobile radio interference at a fixed service receiver depends on the performance requirements of the service. However a commonly used Standard which requires that the INR is less than -16dB has been adopted in this Thesis, and therefore an outage is defined to occur when the CNR ratio is less than the minimum required for reliable reception, or when the INR exceeds -16dB.    Sufficient electromagnetic isolation between fixed and mobile systems sharing the same spectrum may be achieved using excision suppression techniques or by geographically separating the two systems. Excision suppression techniques will have a detrimental effect on the performance of a mobile radio system unless the fixed service signal is sufficiently narrow-band. The geographical separation distances required for spectrum sharing between fixed services, and outdoor and in-building DS-CDMA mobile radio systems are presented. The fixed services are assumed to be similar to those operating in New Zealand in the 1.7-2.3 GHz frequency bands. Mobile radio systems with 5, 10, 15 and 48 MHz channels are considered. It is shown that, for the systems considered, the geographical separation required between the two systems depends largely on the mobile radio and inter-system propagation characteristics, and the mobile radio and fixed service transmission powers.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, ELECTRONICS AND ELECTRICAL (0544)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Electrical and Electronic Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/12</field></doc><doc><field name="title">O le A'oa'oina o le gagana, faitautusi ma le tusitusi i le a'oga a le faifeau: Ekalesia Faapotopotoga Kerisiano Samoa (EFKS) = Literacy education, language, reading and writing in the pastor's school: Congregational Christian Church of Samoa (CCCS)</field><field name="creator">Tanielu, Lonise Sera</field><field name="description">This study is about an educational experience, which encompasses a range of educational knowledge and skills. It is an experience that is relatively unknown in educational research terms. It is also ct comparatively 'secular' educational experience within a 'religious' institution, the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa (CCCS). The Pastor's School (A'oga a le Faifeau) system teaches children to read and write, employing both Palagi and Fa'a Samoa frameworks. The study is also a positive response to the critical and sometimes negative historical treatment of the church and the Fa'a Samoa, especially in their role in the Samoan child's critical literacy experiences. In the light of the underachievement of Samoan children (especially in literacy-reading and writing), this thesis makes two arguments. They are: i) The Pastors' Schools are an important educational system that have escaped attention but which have profoundly significant educational content and impacts. ii) There is a literacy problem in New Zealand that the A'oga a le Faifeau could address for the reported underachieving Samoan children. The content of the A'oga a le Faifeau syllabus for example, includes the teaching of reading, writing, arithmetic, religious and general knowledge, and the Fa'a Samoa This knowledge forms part of the semantic resources, and literacy skills and expertise, which could prepare children for school because some of those knowledge and skills have spans to school-based literacies. One of the A'oga a le Faifeau's most significant educational impacts is the maintenance and retention of the Samoan language.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automatic structures</field><field name="creator">Rubin, Sasha</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates structures that are presentable by finite automata working synchronously on tuples of finite words.

Crucial to an understanding of this is the Sartre quotation in Winterspelt . According to Sartre's &#8216;original project&#8217;, the individual human being starts off life as a rough outline, which lives itself subjectively, filtering objective reality through its own preconceptions and thus experiencing nothing which is not part of these preconceptions. As a painter creates an outline on a blank canvas, so we create the outline of our own lives and determin our destiny.    In Andersch's novels, which are set against the existential void, the fate of the characters is never predetermined; rather, it is the individual's line of thinking which determines his or her course of action, and determines the nature of his or her relationships with others. As Andersch's characters become more aware of their freedom as human beings, they are able to develop conscious artistic outlines and so turn the existential void into a place of freedom. This thesis looks at four closely interrelated aspects of the artistic outline: &#8216;Lines of Thought&#8217;, &#8216;The Development of Outlines&#8217;, &#8216;New Directions&#8217; and &#8216;Co-existence and convergence: the individual artistic outline as part of a whole&#8217;. By showing the development of these aspects across the four novels, it draws conclusions not only about Alfred Andersch's development as a writer but also about his vision of humanity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">LITERATURE, GERMANIC (0311)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--German)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/13</field></doc><doc><field name="title">General equilibrium analysis of Sri Lanka's trade liberalization policy options</field><field name="creator">Tennakoon, Kadupitige Upalinie Ajitha</field><field name="description">Sri Lanka's trade regime has been gradually liberalized over the last two decades with the aim of deeper integration into the global economy. The purpose of this study is to present a quantitative assessment of the impacts of major unilateral, regional and multilateral trade liberalization on Sri Lanka, and rank the trade policy options in terms of their welfare effects. This study contributes to the empirical literature on trade liberalization. The Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model is used to analyze the welfare effects of trade liberalization in a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium framework. The results show that if Sri Lanka implements the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA), while maintaining 15 percent external tariffs for the rest of the world, this combined policy would provide the highest welfare gain to Sri Lanka. The SAFTA by its own would provide the second-highest ranked gain from the trade reforms due to the benefits of preferential access to the large SAARC market. The third-highest ranked policy option comes under the unilateral reduction of import tariffs to 15 percent scenario. As results indicate, the Indo-Lanka Free Trade Agreement (ILFTA) offers the fourth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Finally, the phasing-out of MFA on Textiles and Clothing under the Uruguay Round Agreement, rank as the fifth-highest policy option for Sri Lanka. Thus, regional trade liberalization is far more preferable to unilateral and multilateral liberalization. However, as the GTAP model permits, these rankings based on only to the static welfare gains, ignoring the dynamic effect of trade liberalization.    In addition, the gravity model has been employed to examine the determinants of Sri Lanka's bilateral trade flows with her selected trading partners, in order to sort out the influence of geographical proximity versus preferential trading policies in creating a regional concentration in trade. Our results confirm the validity of geographical factors such as proximity and cultural familiarity, as determinants of Sri Lanka's trade with neighbouring countries. They suggest that the selected trading partners are &#8220;natural trading partners&#8221; of Sri Lanka.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, INTERNATIONAL LAW AND RELATIONS (0616)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, GENERAL (0501)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, COMMERCE-BUSINESS (0505)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Economics)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/14</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional responses during discrimination learning by retarded children</field><field name="creator">Singh, Nirbhay Nand</field><field name="description">In Experiment I, eight mentally retarded children were trained on a simultaneous two-choice discrimination problem and a series of discrimination-shift problems. Subjects performed overt observing responses to produce elements of the discriminative stimuli, making it possible to measure directly changes in attention to different aspects of stimuli during learning. The patterns of change in observing responses were generally in line with descriptions of attentional changes derived from two-process theories of discrimination learning; for example, the frequency of irrelevant observing responses was high during the pre-solution period during extradimensional shifts but was low during intradimensional shifts. Contrary to current theories, extradimensional shifts caused an immediate increase in irrelevant responses, and intradimensional shifts caused an increase in relevant observing responses. Subjects responded to later shift problems by initially increasing both relevant and irrelevant observing responses, then withholding irrelevant observing responses. Experiment II examined the effects of three variables, the provision and non-provision of a mechanical observing response, the stimulus dimensionality, and degrees of relevance of the irrelevant stimuli, on the discrimination learning and transfer performance of sixteen mentally retarded children. The subjects were trained on simultaneous two-choice discrimination problems using complex stimuli containing either dimensional stimuli or mixed- &#8216;dimensional stimuli. Subjects were then tested on either intradimensional or extradimensional shifts. When dimensional stimuli were used, intradimensional shifts were easier than extradimensional shifts but when mixed-dimensional stimuli were used, the relative difficulty of the intradimensional and extradimensional shifts depended on whether observing-response buttons were provided. When observing-response buttons were provided, intradimensional shifts were again easier than extradimensional shifts but when these buttons were not provided, intradimensional shifts were harder than extradimensional shifts. The relative ease of intradimensional over extradimensional shifts was found to be further affected by the degree of relevance of the less-relevant dimension. The superiority of the intradimensional over extradimensional shift performance was progressively reduced and then eliminated as the degree of relevance of the irrelevant dimension was gradually increased. Subproblem analysis showed that subjects typically treated subproblems independently, even though there was some degree of dimensional analysis of stimuli, and intradimensional shifts were usually easier than extradimensional shifts. This finding is inconsistent with the usual interpretation of the relative ease of intradimensional over extradimensional shifts as an indication of non independence of subproblems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of AAV1/2 mediated delivery of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 on adult rodent neurogenesis</field><field name="creator">Henry, Rebecca Ann</field><field name="description">Neurogenesis is the process by which functionally integrated neurons are generated from progenitor cells.  In the adult mammalian brain two sites of high density cell division have been identified that contain neural progenitor cells retaining the ability to generate new neurons:  the subgranular zone of the hippocampus (SGZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles in the forebrain.  Several studies have suggested that SVZ neural progenitor cells in the adult brain can migrate into regions other than the olfactory bulb after either administration of growth factors, induction of neuronal cell loss or injury.  Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) play major roles in regulating the survival and fate of progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain.  To determine the effect of BDNF or FGF-2 on neurogenesis in the injured adult brain, BDNF or FGF-2 were over-expressed in the subventricular zone (SVZ) via recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV1/2) delivery and newly generated cells were identified using bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 150mg/kg intraperitoneal) labelling.  Selective striatal cell loss was induced in a subgroup of rats by unilateral striatal injection of the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QA) 21 days after AAV1/2 injection and 24 hours prior to BrdU labeling.  The results of this thesis demonstrate that BDNF augments the recruitment, neuronal differentiation and survival of progenitor cells in both neurogenic and non-neurogenic regions of the unlesioned or QA lesioned brain.  BDNF also appears to contribute to the persistence of newly generated neurons in the QA lesioned striatum.  Our results provide the first evidence demonstrating the neurogenic effect of BDNF on compensatory striatal neurogenesis in the injured adult brain and suggest that enhanced BDNF expression may be a viable strategy for inducing or augmenting endogenous neural progenitor cell neurogenesis.  Unlike the effect of BDNF, FGF-2 appears to have no effect on proliferation and/or survival of neural progenitor cells in either the normal or damaged brain.  FGF-2 appears to be unable to act as a positive mediator of SVZ progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in this study.  However, FGF-2 may be having an inhibitory effect on progenitor cell differentiation.  The negative result of the FGF-2 study may be of major significance in indicating the potential requirement of additional factors interacting with FGF-2 to influence neurogenesis.  The results from the FGF-2 study contribute to the research field in highlighting the complexity of the mammalian neurogenic process.  This thesis highlights the need for further investigation into multiple factor interactions, tighter regulation of the transgenic protein expression from the AAV1/2 delivery vector or alternative progenitor cell labelling paradigms.  However, it does show that if neurogenesis can be induced or augmented exogenously, neural progenitor cells may provide a substrate for repair in the adult brain and dramatically change therapeutic approaches towards the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Neurodegenerative Diseases</field><field name="subject">neurogenesis</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1492</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The AtMRS2 gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana</field><field name="creator">Drummond, Revel Scott MacGregor</field><field name="description">Magnesium (Mg2+) is an essential mineral nutrient for plants and is the most abundant free divalent cation in plant cells. However, our knowledge of the role of this ion in the plant cell is limited, and the mechanisms of homeostasis and transport of the ion are almost completely unknown. A. Tutone (this laboratory) identified an Arabidopsis thaliana gene by the complementation of a Mg2+-uptake yeast mutant (CM66). This gene, referred to as AtMRS2-11, was expressed as cDNA from a strong yeast promoter and allowed the growth of the CM66 yeast strain on standard media. The conceptually translated AtMRS2-11 protein sequence was used in this study to identify nine additional proteins by sequence homology searches using the BLAST algorithm. The corresponding genes have been cloned from cDNA (A. thaliana ecotype Landsberg erecta) and sequenced. Protein sequence similarity suggests that the family forms a sub-section of the CorA super-family of Mg2+ transport proteins. The mutant yeast used to identify the family initially was also used to show that two family members in addition to AtMRS2-11 were able to complement the Mg2+-dependent growth phenotype. When fused to eGFP, these proteins showed a localisation consistent with some of the protein reaching the yeast cell membrane. The other members of the family were also fused to eGFP and showed a range of localisation patterns within the yeast cell. None of the three AtMRS2 proteins previously able to complement the yeast mutant phenotype did so when fused to eGFP. RNA transcripts from the AtMRS2 family were detected by RT-PCR in organ-scale preparations of total RNA from A. thaliana. Most family members were detected in all of the organs tested. Northern analysis of AtMRS2-11 RNA transcript level showed that the gene was more highly expressed in leaf tissue, but was not affected by decreased levels of Mg2+ in the growth media. The levels of steady state AtMRS2-11 mRNA transcript were elevated two-fold in the light during the diurnal cycle, but no change was detected during light-induced greening of etiolated seedlings. A stable transgenic A. thaliana line expressing the gusA gene from the promoter region of AtMRS2-11 was used to localise the promoter's activity to cells containing chloroplasts. The expression appeared highest in younger cells. VI The AtMRS2-11 protein was predicted to contain a chloroplast targeting peptide. Western analysis demonstrated that AtMRS2-11 was enriched in the total proteins of isolated chloroplasts as compared to extracts from whole plants. The AtMRS2-11:eGFP fusion protein was also detected in chloroplasts by fluorescence microscopy. Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy was used in conjunction with isolated chloroplasts to try to determine the effects of the overaccumulation of the AtMRS2-11 protein in a transgenic A. thaliana plant line (constructed by A. Tutone). A rapid uptake or binding of Mg2+ was seen in chloroplasts isolated from both wild type and transgenic lines, but no differences were observed in either the rate of Mg2+ uptake/binding or the final Mg2+ content.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Biology, Plant Physiology (0817)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/15</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vincent Ward: the emergence of an aesthetic</field><field name="creator">Read, Lynette</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the work and career of New Zealand director, Vincent Ward, focusing on the emergence of his distinctive aesthetic. It places this aesthetic in the context of local and European artistic and filmic traditions (in particular, certain forms of Romanticism and Expressionism) that have influenced Ward's work. It also explores how his childhood and education may have shaped his approach, and examines what his aesthetic has meant in practice, in the process of making each of his major films, as well as in the formal characteristics of the completed films. The study focuses to a greater extent on his early (New Zealand) films as case studies that help us to understand the development of his practice and theory. The career of Ward as a filmmaker who has had a significant influence on the development of the New Zealand film industry is also explored in the light of what may differentiate his approach from that of other local filmmakers and the extent to which it is useful to think of him as a "New Zealand filmmaker". This thesis draws from extensive primary research in the form of interviews with the director, his family, associates and collaborators (cameramen, editors, co-writers, producers and so on). Textual study has involved the viewing New Zealand and Expressionist films and art-works, and the examination of archival and unpublished material. Secondary research has included coverage of European and local artistic and filmic traditions and, the relatively limited body of criticism of Ward's films. While this thesis takes an essentially auteurist approach - identifying characteristic themes, visual motifs and stylistic tendencies - it also seeks to expand and reposition such an approach by taking into account intellectual and cultural history, the contributions of Ward's collaborators, and the complex industrial conditions in which his films were produced. To do so has necessitated a close examination of the filmmaking process. By examining the aesthetic of such a director - known for his heightened individualism, perfectionism, and unusual methods - this study has sought to reveal the strengths and limitations of classic auteur theory, suggesting ways in which this approach can be modified and re-invigorated. The thesis also provides a case study in the difficulties faced by a director of this kind in finding a satisfactory base within the contemporary film industry. The alignment of local and global interests and investments is still a highly complex business.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Treaty of Waitangi: a study of its making, interpretation and role in New Zealand history</field><field name="creator">Orange, Claudia</field><field name="description">From 1840 to the present, the Treaty of Waitangi has been a subject of some significance in New Zealand &#8211; a distinctive but subtle thread running through the fabric of the country&#8217;s history and shaping attitudes to race relations.

In 1617 he published Rabdologiae, which explained several devices for aiding calculation: (1) numbering rods to aid multiplication (known as 'Napier's bones'); (2) other rods to aid evaluation of square and cube roots; (3) the first publication of binary arithmetic, as far as square root extraction; and (4) the Promptuary for multiplication of numbers (up to 10 digits each), which has a strong claim to be regarded as the first calculating machine. Napier's explanation of the construction of his logarithms was published posthumously in 1619 as Constructio Canonis Logarithmorum, in which he developed much of the differential calculus in order to define his logarithms as the solution of a differential equation and then constructed strict upper and lower bounds for the solution. His incomplete manuscript on arithmetic and algebra (written in the early 1590s) was published in 1839 as De Arte Logistica.    This thesis provides the first English translations of De Arte Logistica and of Rabdologiae, and it reprints Edward Wright's English translation (1616) of the Descriptio and W. R. Macdonald's English translation (1889) of the Constructio. Extensive commentaries are given on Napier's work on arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. The history of trigonometry is traced from ancient Babylonia and Greece through mediaeval Islam to Renaissance Europe. Napier's logarithms (and spherical trigonometry) resulted in an explosion of logarithms over most of the world, with European ships using logarithms for navigation as far as Japan by 1640.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">MATHEMATICS (0405)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY OF SCIENCE (0585)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 1978</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/16</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contentious Birds: The Owl and the Nightingale and Other Poems in a Singular Middle English Verse Tradition</field><field name="creator">Parker, Cynthia Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the use of birds in medieval English poetry as reflections of humans and human society. I look especially at some of the ways in which medieval animals are used to comment satirically on the frailties and foibles of the human animal, man. Birds and beasts configured as humans present particular problems of identity and alterity that lend themselves well to the composition of recreational verse, and the fact that they are both so similar to humans and so different is particularly conducive to their use as vehicles of parody and satire. Also considered here are some of the early works in which animals are studied both as themselves and in comparison with humans, especially the texts of such classic natural historians as Aristotle and Pliny. I also glance, if only briefly, at the second-century Physiologus, which incorporates the work of Pliny and his followers together with biblical texts and Christianized moralizations. This seminal work, in the form of its direct descendants the medieval bestiaries, is a major source for writers of animal narrative in the Middle Ages. My study is organized in two parts. Part One contains the material outlined above together with some discussion on different kinds of satire&#8212;in particular, the satire of incongruity, so important in the context of animal impersonation of humans. It also considers the use of birds in various comic-satiric genres, especially in recreational texts such as the clerk and knight d&#233;bats, liturgical parodies and, above all, the peculiarly English genre of bird debate. The vernacular literary tradition represented in the eight bird poems in this section&#8212;ranging from the thirteenth to the early sixteenth century, some dialogic, some not&#8212;virtually constitutes a minor genre in which even a major poet like Chaucer was happy to work. Part Two contains four chapters devoted to a close reading and textual analysis of a single poem, The Owl and the Nightingale, probably the earliest and certainly the best of all the Middle English two&#8212;party bird debates. (My title&#8212;Contentious Birds&#8211;is derived from the descriptive title of thirteenth century poems in this particular debate tradition: The Thrush and the Nightingale, for example, appears in MS Digby 86 under the heading, "Ci commence la cuntent parente le Mauuis &amp; la russinole&#8221;). A spirited dispute of nearly eighteen hundred lines, The Owl and the Nightingale dates from the late twelfth or thirteenth century, and is remarkable above all for its freshness and originality, and its sheer, delightful ease of writing. A final chapter looks at conclusions in the debates and other poems in this study; at the question of the disputants' usefulness to man, particularly in The Owl and the Nightingale, and at the fluctuating nature of the boundaries that separate human from animal. Principal concerns in my thesis are the nature and the variety of the literary relationships constructed in the Middle Ages around these dividing lines between humans and birds or beasts (in this case, birds), and the ways in which these precarious lines of demarcation can be put especially, to recreational literary use.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1640</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"A Colonial Tale of Fact and Fiction": Nineteenth-Century New Zealand Novels by Women</field><field name="creator">Mackay, Morag</field><field name="description">This thesis plots the emergence and development of the nineteenth-century New Zealand women's novel. Previously silenced in favour of a masculinist nationalist tradition, a renewed interest in our earliest literary foremothers has arisen as a result of feminism. Arguing for their acknowledgement as part of our literary history, this thesis examines the significance of these novels in the recording and formulation of a New Zealand culture and literature. The body of the thesis is constructed of three chapters, each representing a different literary from used by these novelists. The earliest is the adventure story, showcasing New Zealand's flora and fauna for the British reading public, and providing excitement in the from of the New Zealand wars, cannibalism, whaling and natural disasters. Second comes the romance, which portrays the developing colonial society and begins to define what it means to be a "New Zealander". Part B of this chapter discusses the treatment of Maori in these women's novels. It examines a group of romances with part-Maori protagonists, in which the novelists address the issue of the place of Maori in the new society. Last are the didactic novels, in which temperance, religion and women's rights are argued for. This thesis considers the characteristics of each of these forms of novel and examines the social and political contexts that gave rise to these choices. Through their novels these women communicate what it meant to be a colonial New Zealand woman - revealing their views on such issues as colonisation, relationship with Maori, the new "classless" society, marriage, and opportunities for women. They reveal a concern with the development of "the New Zealander", a New Zealand literature and culture, and evidence a developing sense of national identity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand's Relations With Northeast Asia: Links and Interactions Under Globalisation</field><field name="creator">Stringer, Christina A</field><field name="description">In the mid-1980s New Zealand embarked on a path of radical economic reform. The changes that occurred and are still occurring in New Zealand are in part, of external origin and came about from an opening of the domestic economy to wider forces thereby re-incorporating New Zealand into the global economy. Le Heron and Pawson (1996) propose that in the 1990s, economic globalization &#8211; the process of integration, deepening and differentiation of economic activities throughout the world -- has lead to new links and interactions. In seeking to identify the external and internal forces leading to the development of new links and interactions between New Zealand and Northeast Asia (Japan, Taiwan and Korea), analysis is made of changes occurring within investment, production and trade connections. This thesis is informed by two bodies of literature: the world systems literature stresses the development of inter-country relationships in an historical context, and political economy literature links resource regimes to periods of capitalist accumulation. In order to remain active participants in the global economy New Zealand entreprises and industries are pursuing strategies of linking into the Northeast Asian economies. Two key economic sectors, agro-food and forestry, have been chosen for investigation in order to examine changes as New Zealand industries, enterprises and local regions seek to achieve greater integration into the Northeast Asian region. A re-articulation of production is occurring as New Zealand's agro-food sector is incorporated into a Northeast Asian food import complex. Changing patterns of production and consumption are examined within the context of the food regime perspective. While new opportunities are increasing for New Zealand agro-food exporters, trade still reflects New Zealand's traditional export base of first and second food regime products from the beef and dairy sectors. The expansion of a fresh fruit and vegetable complex represents an emerging third regime. Since the mid-1980s the New Zealand forestry sector has become increasingly integrated into a national complex centered upon Japan. The dismantling of the national regulatory regime introduced a number of foreign investors and subsequently led to the reorganisation of trade and production networks. Prior to this time, forestry exports to Northeast Asia were inconsistent, comprising mostly logs and low value products with processing occurring in Japan. While unprocessed exports remain a significant composition of forestry trade there is a move away from low value products into more end-use-application specific production. This is accompanied by a shift in production facilities and an increase of economic surplus in New Zealand. Land based industries in the Hawkes Bay provide examples of local adaptations of production to agro-food and forestry complexes centred upon Northeast Asia. Integration into these complexes has facilitated access to new markets and resulted in increasing degrees of added value. This has only been possible in the context of the gradual relaxation of regulatory regimes that has occurred over the past two decades. In some cases, integration is an outcome of Northeast Asian ownership of New Zealand based nodes along the commodity chain. In others, it is an outcome of New Zealand actors producing to meet 'site of consumption' demand. In spite of New Zealand's adjustments to globalisation, it essentially remains a semi-peripheral production site.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1642</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics of the scallop Pecten novaezelandiae in the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Morrison, Mark Andrew</field><field name="description">The population biology and ecology of scallops in Greater Omaha Bay (a semi-oceanic bay) and Kawau Bay (a estuarine bay) was quantified by observation and experiment. Information was collected to extend the knowledge base on northern New Zealand scallop population dynamics, and for application to potential scallop enhancement in the region. Contagious scallop population organisation was found at all spatial scales examined, ranging from bay wide through to individual bed patchiness, down to the scale of inter-animal distances. Such clumping has strong implications for a range of population processes, including fishing susceptibility and fertilisation success. Monitoring of adults found two main spawning events to occur; in late October and in mid January. Changes in the gonado-somatic index (GSI) were well synchronised between individuals within populations. Subsequent monitoring of spat-fall in artificial collectors documented two main recruitment events, probably the outcomes of the two local spawning events. These spat-fall events occurred on collectors separated by 1Os of km. However, substantial density variations occurred between sites, indicating that local hydrodynamics may have played a significant role in modifying local spat-fall intensities. Smaller spat-fall events were also present between the two major events. The number of spat collected at a number of combinations of site and time were sufficient to support commercial spat catching operations, although problems were encountered with spat detaching at sizes too small to be retained by the collectors. In the 1993/94 summer a large algal bloom event completely eliminated scallop recruitment to collectors for the first three months of that season. Mass mortality events were a major contributor to overall benthic scallop population mortality. Probable causes included intensive scallop harvesting (commercial and recreational), a major storm episode, and a large algal bloom. These effectively eliminated scallop populations from Greater Omaha Bay. The adjacent Kawau Bay was not affected by any of these particular events, but populations there did not survive long after reaching adult sizes. Estimates of M (natural mortality) were higher for all scallop populations than have been previously documented in New Zealand studies. Growth trajectories were reasonably consistent in waters shallower than 19 m, but a progressive decline occurred in both maximal size reached and average growth rates with increasing depth after this point. Food limitation may have been the mechanism involved, which is likely to vary significantly for other locations depending on local environmental conditions. Average time to recruitment to the fishery (100 mm shell width) was three years for the shallower populations. A slight reduction in average size of adults at higher densities was found for some populations, indicating a possible density-dependent effect. Examination of a high density scallop bed found animals to display distinctive substratum preferences over small spatial scales, with higher abundances occurring on coarser materials such as shell gravel, marl and grit. Mud was not favoured as a habitat type. Movements of tagged animals at this location were spatially limited to within the particular habitat patch in which an individual was tagged and released, i.e. at a scale of 1s to 1Os of metres. No animals moved between adjacent patches of similar habitat (100 m scale). A B.A.C.I type experiment was undertaken to assess incidental mortality effects of commercial scallop dredging on undersize scallops, at the spatial scale of beds. Significant negative effects were quantified, with the number of undersize animals killed per legal animal harvested estimated at 1.7 and 2.8 : 1, depending on the size frequency structure of the fished bed. Modelling of likely improvements in the number of animals surviving at the end of fishing, given a reduction in the minimum legal size from 100 to 90 mm, indicated improvements of 20 to 41% of the original population remaining after fishing, depending on animal size and assumed dredge efficiencies, A 90 mm MLS has subsequently been adopted by the Coromandel Scallop Fishery. The results from this work provide detailed population based estimates of parameters required for successful management and optimal harvesting strategies of Hauraki Gulf scallop populations. The large variability in parameters such as mortality, and strong abundance correlations with habitat type, has strong implications for such activities. This work also provides essential information for the undertaking of locally based enhancement operations, such as the spatial and temporal magnitude and variability of spat-fall events, and growth rates with respect to habitat features (i.e. depth).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1706</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spat production of the Greenshell&#8482; mussel Perna canaliculus in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Buchanan, Samuel J.</field><field name="description">The research presented in this thesis was undertaken in order to develop an understanding of the biology of Perna canaliculus sufficient to allow for commercial hatchery based production of Greenshell&#8482; mussel spat. Hatchery production is an alternative to unreliable and inconsistent wild spat collection. In a Perna canaliculus population followed for one year spawning occurred in early spring and late summer. Three quantitative histological measures of gonad maturity utilising image analysis technology and a qualitative classification system were compared. Measuring the relative surface area comprised of gametes on histological sections was found to be the most reliable method. A practical gonad visual index to determine the reproductive condition of adults for the selection of broodstock was developed and found to be highly effective as a means of predicting induced spawning success. Serotonin was not effective for inducing spawning of Perna canaliculus. Temperature shock and the use of stripped gametes was however found to be a reliable spawning induction method. Relative gamete concentration, gamete age, temperature, sperm half life and gamete contact times were all found to have effects on fertilisation success for Perna canaliculus. Sperm concentration and the conditions of sperm aging were particularly important. Fertilisation kinetics of Perna canaliculus gametes modelled using the Vogel-Czihak-Chang-Wolf method suggested that 5% of sperm-egg contacts lead to successful fertilisation. Broodstock management protocols that could be used to condition the adult of Perna canaliculus were investigated in order to enhance and prolong the natural reproductive season. Research suggested that for successful broodstock conditioning animals should already have begun gametogenesis at the time conditioning is commenced. Successful conditioning of Perna canaliculus was achieved at temperatures between l0 and 16&#176;C over a period of about 50 days. A diet ration above 2-3% of the dry meat mass per day is suggested. A trial examining non-algal diet supplements suggest a mixture of yeast and lipid emulsion may have some potential value. Photoperiod manipulation did not effect the reproductive condition of Perna canaliculus. The yield of veliger larvae was significantly enhanced if embryo culture water was treated with 1.0 mg/l EDTA. Veliger yield was not significantly affected at densities below 50 embryos/ml. Perna canaliculus larvae grew most rapidly and survived well at the salinity of 35 ppt. Larvae grew most rapidly when cultured at low densities. Experiments suggest that early larvae can be cultured at 5-10/ml, however late stage larvae grew most rapidly when cultured at l/ml. Perna canaliculus larvae displayed best growth and good survival if fed a mixed flagellate-diatom diet comprising Isochrysis galbana (T-Iso) and Chaetoceros calcitrans. The optimal diet ration, as a function of larval size, increased from about 20 cells/&#956;l Isochrysis galbana (T-Iso) to around 150 cells/&#956;l through the larval development period. Thyroxine between the concentrations of l0-5 and l0-8 M did not have an observable effect on larval developmental rate or eye spot development. Down welling settlement systems were found to be generally successful for Perna canaliculus lanrae. L-DOPA was also demonstrated to enhance the settlement and metamorphosis of Perna canaliculus pediveligers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1707</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The question of learning to read and write</field><field name="creator">Koefoed, Blair</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into learning to read and write. It is also an investigation into how learning to read and write is investigated. THE PRESENTING PROBLEM Despite literacy being highly valued by every member of a modern society and the immense personal and social effort directed towards bringing it within the grasp of all, its universal occurrence, it remains an elusive goal. INVESTIGATING LITERACY As with many other valued human endeavours, science, with its refined and disciplined way of looking, is enlisted to help improve the achievement of ends, and research is designed and undertaken with the aim of increasing our control over its manifestation in the world. Yet it is the claim of this thesis that by leaving uninvestigated the nature of learning to read and write itself the gains will never be complete. PHILOSOPHICAL INVESTIGATIONS To open different lines of investigation, into things themselves, questioning must free itself of socially driven exigencies and the patterns of the established disciplines of thought and become self-reflexive. Self-referential questioning is traditionally and essentially philosophical and insight is sought from three well known modern representatives of the field. - Heidegger offers reflections on the importance of how questioning is undertaken, and, with his discussions on the nature of truth and how with 'revealing' comes 'concealing' hints at the darker side of literacy as a activity that 'opens' the world. - Wittgenstein's intense thought on language/world relationships potentially clarifies the dissension so characteristic of literacy acquisition research and provides a construct of language that would allow misrepresentations of literacy to occur. - Foucault's historical analyses provide concepts useful when considering the origins of literacy, and 'power' becomes a better explanation for the literacy fervour than the production of finer human beings. THE FINAL QUESTION Finally their amalgamated insights are used to discuss the phenomenon of illiteracy as it is portrayed in a recent novel by Bernard Schlink, The Reader. In this study of post-war Germany, the way literacy is deeply entwined into our social structures becomes clear, but more crucially we learn this about illiteracy - the highly destructive, exaggerated, and excessive reaction to its occurrence has no ready explanation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual abuse investigation and criminal court processes: doing justice to the child?</field><field name="creator">Davies, Emma</field><field name="description">This thesis has contributed to the international literature on child sexual abuse investigation and criminal justice processes by conducting a programme evaluation of these processes in Auckland, New Zealand. In the first part of the study, 51 child complainants and 124 primary carers were interviewed about their perceptions of social work investigation, evidential interviewing, access to counselling services, police investigation, medical examinations and, for some, criminal court proceedings. Although participants were predominantly satisfied with early interactions with professionals, both children and primary carers highlighted the need for better interagency collaboration, reduced time delays throughout the process, earlier access to support services, more information and increased involvement in decision making. With specific reference to criminal court, participants indicated a need for better pre-court education and debriefing. The second part of this research involved analyses of criminal court transcripts on the ways that children are questioned by evidential interviewers and lawyers in court. The transcript analyses showed that some cross-examination strategies are reliant on prejudicial stereotypes of children and false assumptions about the dynamics of sexual abuse. In combination, the interviews and transcript analyses, indicate that Judges could usefully ensure that children are asked questions in terms they understand. The thesis revealed deficiencies within agency practices and, to a lesser extent, agency policies which impact negatively on children and their families during the sexual abuse investigation and criminal justice processes. It was shown that in practice these processes do not fully comply with Article 3(1) of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, in that the best interests of the child are not always 'of primary consideration'. Recommendations to address some of these deficiencies were proposed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multimodal (im)politeness: the verbal, prosodic and non-verbal realization of disagreement in German and New Zealand English</field><field name="creator">Stadler, Stefanie Alexa</field><field name="description">The present study takes a multimodal approach to speech act analysis. It investigates the disagreeing behaviour of Germans and New Zealanders exhibited during televised panel discussions on a verbal, prosodic, and non-verbal level. More specifically, the present study aims to uncover whether there are differences in the use of prosodic and non-verbal cues between the two groups and if potential differences influence how polite a disagreement is perceived to be. The investigation showed that, on a verbal level, Germans have a preference for more concise disagreements, with a more direct and explicit disagreeing style, producing a large number of strengthening devices, while New Zealanders produce more indirect disagreements, containing a large number of softening devices. Prosodically, the Germans differ from the New Zealanders by using audibly loud and fast speech significantly more frequently, while the two groups&#8217; use of mean pitch, pitch range and intensity range differs little. On a non-verbal level, Germans produce significantly more non-verbal cues during disagreements than their New Zealand counterparts. The main difference between the two groups, however, lies in how their disagreeing behaviour differs from their non-verbal behaviour in neutral speech. While Germans use significantly fewer non-verbal cues in neutral speech than in disagreements and also use a much more limited range of non-verbal cues, the New Zealanders&#8217; non-verbal behaviour in disagreements differs little from their behaviour in neutral speech. In order to test the effect of these differences on the perceived level of politeness, two questionnaires were developed; one prosodic questionnaire testing the effects of loud and fast speech in disagreements on the perceived level of politeness and one non-verbal questionnaire testing the effect of a large number of non-verbal cues on the perceived level of politeness. The results show that fast and loud speech has a negative effect on politeness, as perceived by New Zealanders. A large number of non-verbal cues only appear to have a negative effect on the level of politeness, as perceived by New Zealanders, when disagreements exhibit a high level of involvement and emotion. Overall, it appears that German disagreeing behaviour is likely to be perceived negatively by New Zealanders.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Linguistics)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1766</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of 'spiritual meaning-making' on career choice, transition and experience</field><field name="creator">Lips-Wiersma, Marjolein Silvia</field><field name="description">The focus of this inquiry is &#8220;The influence of &#8216;spiritual meaning-making&#8217; on career choice, transition and experience&#8221;. Over the past decade there has been an increase in interest in the expression of spiritual belief in work. Most of the writing on the topic is based on the premise that individuals and organisations have lost meaning, and that the problem of meaning in work needs to addressed to enhance the ways in which we organise, and to enhance organisational output and personal wellbeing. Whereas the current writing on spirituality and work often suggests that organisations should provide more meaning, this research took a more humble starting point by asking what meanings individuals with spiritual belief are currently attributing to, and discovering in, their work, and by asking how and whether these meanings determine work behaviour.    I argue in this thesis that the concept of meaning-making is central to spirituality. I reviewed the psychological literature on meaning and as a result decided to focus the inquiry on three core elements of meaning; purpose, sense-making and coherence. In order to step back from the organisational agenda, and give voice to the authenticity of diverse spiritual beliefs, I chose to use career, rather than organisational theory, as framework for this inquiry. An additional theoretical framework of &#8216;agency and communion&#8217; was introduced to conceptualise human motivation beyond its current narrow &#8216;self&#8217; and &#8216;doing&#8217; oriented definitions. A combination of &#8216;collaborative human inquiry&#8217; and &#8216;narrative&#8217; methodology was chosen to elicit subjective career meanings. Fifteen individuals with diverse spiritual beliefs participated in this research. These included a Buddhist, a Quaker, a Catholic, a Bah&#225;'&#237;, and a Mormon, as well as those not currently affiliated with an organized religion.    The findings show that spiritual belief strongly determines career choice, transition and experience. It was found that research participants, in spite of their diverse beliefs, shared four purposes: &#8216;developing and becoming self&#8217;, &#8216;union with others&#8217;, &#8216;expressing self&#8217; and &#8216;serving others&#8217;. When these purposes can be expressed fully, the workplace is experienced to be aligned with spiritual belief, and individuals are contributing fully, especially when diversity of spiritual expressions is acknowledged at the same time. Career transitions are made through an ongoing sense-making process as a result of which the individual may decide that the four purposes are no longer in balance and action is required in order to continue to live meaningfully. This sensemaking is a result of ongoing interaction between the individual and his or her work environment. Coherence is a result of the transrational element of spirituality, when the individual feels his or her work is still aligned with a bigger (divine) plan. This is assessed on an ongoing basis through prayer, asking &#8216;was this meant to be&#8217; and reframing difficulties and setbacks as opportunities for learning and development.    I suggest that it may not be wise to seek collective enactment of the trans-rational as it has no firm basis for collective organisational decision-making. It cannot seek collective expression due to the diversity of beliefs of organisational members. However I strongly suggest that an organisation that wants to align itself with the spiritual beliefs of its members, ensures that the four purposes of &#8216;developing and becoming self&#8217;, &#8216;union with others&#8217;, &#8216;expressing self&#8217; and &#8216;serving others&#8217; can be fully enacted in the organisation, keeping in mind that spirituality expresses itself in process as well as outcome.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, VOCATIONAL (0747)</field><field name="subject">BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, MANAGEMENT (0454)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL (0624)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, GENERAL (0318)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Management and employment relations)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/18</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The institutionalisation of data quality in the New Zealand health sector</field><field name="creator">Kerr, Karolyn</field><field name="description">This research began a journey towards improved maturity around data quality management in New Zealand health care, where total data quality management is 'business as usual" institutionalised into the daily practices of all those who work in health care. The increasingly information intensive nature of health care demands a proactive and strategic approach to data quality to ensure the right information is available to the right person at the right time in the right format, all in consideration of the rights of the patient to have his/her health data protected and used in an ethical way. The work extends and tests principles to establish good practice and overcome practical barriers. This thesis explores the issues that define and control data quality in the national health data collections and the mechanisms and frameworks that can be developed to achieve and sustain good data quality. The research is interpretive, studying meaning within a social setting. The research provides the structure for learning and potential change through the utilisation of action research. Grounded theory provides the structure for the analysis of qualitative data through inductive coding and constant comparison in the analysis phase of the action research iterative cycle. Participatory observation provided considerable rich data as the researcher was a member of staff within the organisation. Data were also collected at workshops, focus groups, structured meetings and interviews. The development of a Data Quality Evaluation Framework and a national Data quality Improvement Strategy provides clear direction for a holistic and 'whole of health sector' way of viewing data quality, with the ability for organisations to develop and implement local innovations through locally developed strategies and data quality improvement programmes. The researcher utilised the theory of appreciative enquiry (Fry, 2002) to positively encourage change, and to encourage the utilisation of existing organisational knowledge. Simple rules, such as the TDQM process and the data quality dimensions guided the change, leaving room for innovation. The theory of 'complex systems of adjustment' (Champagne, 2002; Stacey, 1993) can be instilled in the organisation to encourage change through the constant interaction of people throughout the organisation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321215 Health care administration</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Information Systems)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Education reforms:  The marketisation of education in New Zealand. Human capital theory and student investment decisions</field><field name="creator">Eagle, Lynne Carol</field><field name="description">This thesis traces the development of the New Zealand education reforms which began in the late 1980s from their ideological and theoretical foundations, especially those of human capital theory, through policy development and implementation. Polytechnic business programmes are used as a case study to illustrate the impact of the reforms and of one of the principal mechanisms by which the reforms were expected to be implemented-the National Framework.    Evidence is provided that leads to policy questions regarding the implementation of the Framework under the aegis of the New Zealand Qualifications Authority. These concerns include competency based learning and administration and delivery complexities. The links between the reform intentions and the actuality of implementation are also examined. The assumption that the education reforms are expected to have significant impact on the country's economic performance is examined and factors which impact on workplace organisation and productivity and which may constrain the effects of improved worker education and training are discussed. The instrument of &#8216;the market&#8217; as a means of achieving both efficiencies and effectiveness in tertiary education is also reviewed. There appears to be an absence of a common understanding of the nature, composition and behaviour of education markets.    Indicative evidence is also provided regarding the complexity of student investment decisions with regard to tertiary education decisions. This study provides evidence to support human capital theory as a force influencing the decision to undertaken tertiary education, but as part of a much more complex model of the tertiary education decision making process than it would appear that policy makers have considered.    Evidence is presented that leads to questions regarding the assumption that industry will take ownership of the reform processes. Evidence is presented of industry indifference and inertia to the reforms.    Recommendations for the re-examination of developments to date are made, together with research programmes to provide a sound empirical base for future policy making. Without a structured critical review of the reform intentions versus the emerging actuality, there is a danger that the reforms may, in part at least, prove to be both inefficient and ineffectual.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HIGHER (0745)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BUSINESS (0688)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, FINANCE (0277)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/19</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of two amylin responsive proteins from rat skeletal muscle</field><field name="creator">Lee, Shao Chin</field><field name="description">Two amylin responsive proteins, here designated ARP1 and ARP2, were discovered from rat skeletal muscle through two dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis. ARP1 was detected only in amylin-stimulated muscles where the insulin-stimulated glucose incorporation into glycogen was inhibited. This protein incorporated 32Pi but not [35S]-methionine in the metabolic labeling experiments. Subsequent molecular characterisation revealed that ARP1 was a novel monomeric form (designated form 1) of protein p20, and two other monomeric forms (designated forms 2 and 3 respectively) of protein p20 were also characterised. The production of ARP1 was not affected by the presence of insulin, but calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was found to evoke the production of ARP1 in the presence or absence of insulin. In contrast, ARP2 was detected in both control and amylin-stimulated muscles. Amylin stimulation evoked incorporation of [35S]-methionine but not 32Pi into the protein and increased its concentration significantly. It is concluded that amylin elicits the production of ARP1 through phosphorylation and increases the protein biosynthesis of ARP2; the amylin-evoked production of ARP1 is insulin independent; amylin and CGRP share, at least in part, an intracellular signal transduction pathway; and ARP1 and 2 may be involved in the development of insulin resistance. It is suggested that ARP1 and 2 could potentially be used as molecular markers for the analysis of amylin action.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1901</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecological parasitology of the Polynesian rat (Rattus exulans) on Tiritiri Matangi Island</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Mere</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a descriptive and a functional analysis of the ecology of an island host-parasite system consisting of the Polynesian rat, Rattus exulans (Peale) and its gut helminths. The results, which include an historical perspective, are presented in the form of 7 papers or sections. Each of these examines a particular aspect of this host-parasite relationship. A review of the origin and an update of the theorised dispersal of this rat from Southeast Asia to New Zealand is given in the first section of chapter one. Previous theories have derived the New Zealand populations from a line which passed through Micronesia. In accordance with new information from the Lapita cultural assemblage, this rat is now theorised to have accompanied these "Lapita" peoples through the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands, arriving in the Tonga- Samoa region about 3600-3000 Before Present (B.P.). From here, the Proto- Polynesians then dispersed further east, taking with them the commensal R. exulans, pig, dog, and chicken. This rat is thus thought to have arrived in New Zealand, the most southern and last-settled landmass in Polynesia, in the canoes of the Maori about 1000 years ago. Information on the ecto- and endoparasites of the Polynesian rat from throughout its geographical range is collated and presented in section two. This includes the results of the two surveys (one being part of this thesis) done on the parasites of this rat in New Zealand. All populations of R. exulans sampled in these two surveys came from offshore islands, to which this rat is almost totally confined, and where, on many, it is the only rodent species present. In contrast, most of the populations sampled beyond New Zealand are now sympatric with other rodent species. For the New Zealand populations only, it was also possible to identify those parasites only accidentally associated with this host; these are listed as "transients". In section three, an attempt is made to determine the probable biogeographical origins of parasites recorded from populations of this rat on "exulans only" offshore islands of New Zealand. Such a study was possible only because of the archaeologically documented commensal relationship between rat and Polynesian man. This information, detailed in section one, together with the parasitological data base assembled in section two, provided the material for this analysis. Several "heirloom" species are identified, theorised to have been inherited by this rat during speciation somewhere in Island Southeast Asia. Parasites acquired during dispersal are divided into "old" and "new souvenirs"; the former are thought to have been acquired from sympatric rodent species in Near Oceania sometime prior to 3000 B.P., and the latter from R. rattus, R. norvegicus or Mus musculus introduced in the last 200 years during European settlement in New Zealand. The conclusions further suggest that some at least of the "new souvenir" species have been acquired by R. exulans on "exulans only" offshore islands of New Zealand by cross-transfer from other rodent species which have temporarily gained access to these islands. This theory is examined in more detail in the fourth section, and reports of such accidental colonizations of offshore islands are presented as supporting evidence. In Chapter two, the influence of habitat on the population demography of the host is investigated. Nearly 1000 rats were trapped and necropsied over a 17 month period in three different habitats on Tiritiri Matangi, an "exulans only" island at the entrance to the Auckland harbour. Rank grassland which covers most of this island formed one habitat; a second consisted of forest remnants confined to gullies, and the third consisted of the small, inhabitated, lighthouse station and farmed area at one end of the island. Between-habitat differences were observed in diet, adult longevity, mean weight of immatures, the time of onset of sexual maturation, and annual reproductive output. These results suggested several modifications to existing models of this host's demography in New Zealand. Shelter in particular appears to play an important role in the demography of this species in temperate latitudes. The effects of parasitism on potential fitness parameters e.g. reproduction, and adult mortality/survival, are examined in chapter three. Based on the results obtained in chapter two, a number of hypotheses were developed, and the predictions arising from these were tested. Few significant results were obtained; these revealed habitat and some sexual interactions with the level of infection, at certain times of the year. However, no causal relationship could be established between these effects and host reproduction or mortality. It is concluded that the helminth parasites of this rat on this island have little or no effect on these host parameters, and support the suggestion that these species constitute a depauperate and well-adapted rodent parasite fauna. The last chapter presents the results of an analysis of the effects of habitat, season, host age, and sex on the distribution and abundance of the helminths of this rat on this island. Together, the graphs and the statistical analyses demonstrate that habitat has the most important influence, significantly affecting all 7 species; this effect is of greater magnitude than the other 3 variables on 5/7 of these species. Season and age also have important effects, while sex had no apparent influence. Explanations for the observed patterns are sought in known aspects of the biology of the host in the three habitats described in chapter two, and in the life cycles of the parasites. In total, this thesis provides a comprehensive account of the ecology of the Polynesian rat and its helminth parasites on Tiritiri Matangi Island. It also identifies gaps in the existing data base, formulates certain hypotheses, and makes a number of predictions all of which will hopefully stimulate further interest in this rat and its parasites.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1902</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric synthesis of novel anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Rustenhoven, Job Jesse</field><field name="description">The synthesis of novel C9-halogenated anthracyclinones by Lewis acid promoted cyclisations of ortho-methallyl anthraquinonyl chiral dioxanes has been investigated. Tin tetrachloride-N,N-dimethylformamide promoted cyclisation of the dioxane (30) proceeded with excellent stereoselectivity to give an 82% yield of the diastereomerically pure chlorotetracycle (78). Stronger Lewis acids gave poorer selectivity and boron trifluoride etherate reacted slowly with (30) but with high selectivity to give the diastereomerically pure fluorotetracycle (91) in 58% yield. The presence of a &#946;-methoxy group in the substrate leads to decreased stereoselectivity due to competition between chelation and non-chelation controlled pathways. Stereochemistry was assigned to the products using a combination of X-ray crystallography, conformational analysis, nuclear Overhauser enhancements and chemical degradation. Attempts were made to extend the highly selective acetal cyclisation methodology to the intramolecular reaction of the allylsilane (121), cyclisation of which was expected to provide enantioselective access to the alkene (146). The synthesis of (121) was achieved despite its instability, but attempted cyclisations with Lewis acids or fluoride ions were unsuccessful. The racemic alkene (146) was prepared by an ene cyclisation and subjected to asymmetric dihydroxylation (AD). The products from the AD reactions are of considerable biological interest and have been characterized. Their stereochemistry has been assigned by 1H nmr comparisons with the parent diphenols, which have resulted in revisions of assignments made by earlier workers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1903</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Liberty, peace, and friendliness: the political ideas of Auberon Herbert</field><field name="creator">Edyvane, Valda</field><field name="description">The political ideas of Auberon Herbert are usually associated with the late Victorian Individualist thinkers primarily influenced by the philosopher Herbert Spencer. Although Herbert derived his political philosophy of Voluntaryism from Spencer&#8217;s thinking it also owed much to J. S. Mill. Voluntaryism was based on a Lockean-Spencerian conception of individual natural rights that asserted self-ownership and the moral obligation for individuals to respect the rights of other people. Rights protection against force and fraud constituted the primary purpose of government. Herbert, aptly describing Voluntaryism as the system of liberty, peace and friendliness, applied these principles to a range of situations from street maintenance, to collective property purchase, and, finally, to the voluntary support of the state. Voluntary taxation was the most controversial component of Herbert&#8217;s theory, emphasising its distinctiveness. Although Herbert resisted socialist and new liberal attempts to expand the role of the state, his reasons for doing so shared little in common with conservative critics of this direction. Herbert, a republican and democrat, repeatedly attacked privilege, seeking widespread change including land reform and universal suffrage. His position represented that of a radical reformer seeking to promote Voluntaryism as the basis for friendly co-operation among free individuals at home and abroad. An internationalist, Herbert opposed aggressive imperialism, but also supported national self-determination, including Irish Home Rule. The notion of the voluntary state has led to claims of Herbert&#8217;s anarchism, but research indicates a greater complexity to his political ideas. Overall, Herbert was an extreme libertarian who never completely lost sight of the state, although he greatly limited its role. While Herbert&#8217;s political theory was idealistic, it avoided the social prescription usually associated with utopianism. Herbert&#8217;s commitment to an ethos of radical progressivism was one he shared with other contemporary socialist and anarchist thinkers who, like Herbert, attempted to live the politics they espoused. For his political philosophy and activism, Herbert warrants acknowledgement as one of the most prominent English libertarians of the nineteenth century.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Co-Operation; Individual freedom; Individual rights; Individualism; Libertarianism; Liberty; Natural rights;</field><field name="subject">Voluntary taxation; Voluntaryism</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political Studies)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand and the search for security 1944-1954: 'a modest and moderate collaboration'</field><field name="creator">Barrington, Brook</field><field name="description">In the decade which followed the Second World War, New Zealand foreign policy was preoccupied with issues of national security. The war had revealed not only that New Zealand could be threatened by Asian hostility, but also that British power could no longer be relied upon for protection. Successive New Zealand governments therefore looked for ways to reinforce the security of New Zealand. Their central objective was to seek a modest and moderate collaboration with key allies. As a result of this search for security, New Zealand foreign policy was transformed in the decade 1944-1954. Not only did politicians and officials engage in an ever-increasing round of international meetings and conferences, but the formal international obligations of the Dominion grew at a remarkable rate. New Zealand began the decade signing the Australian - New Zealand Agreement, and ended the decade a member of the South East Asia Collective Defence Treaty. In the intervening years the Dominion had become party to the ANZAM arrangement and the ANZUS treaty, and had joined the Colombo Plan. New Zealanders also played a not insignificant part in the formation and operation of the United Nations, the occupation of Japan, the Japanese peace treaty, and the Korean war. This rapid growth in the complexity of New Zealand foreign policy sprang from two sources. The first was the policy of collaboration, which involved the Dominion in a range of international activities at which New Zealand leaders would have balked had they not been in the company of key allies. The second source was a sense of institutional confidence and growing expertise. New Zealand officials and politicians had learned diplomatic skills and acquired international recognition during the Second World War, and the creation of the Department of External Affairs in 1943 meant that Dominion had both the experience and the machinery to take a much wider interest in world affairs. By 1954, links with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth, although cherished and still very important, were no longer predominant. New Zealand's main strategic commitment remained in the Middle East, but the shifting frontiers of the cold war and the prospect of regional rather than global conflict had forced New Zealand policymakers to take greater account of events in the Pacific. This was reinforced by New Zealand's traditional policy of collaboration: both the United Kingdom and the United States had also become more involved in Pacific affairs. And as the focus of New Zealand foreign policy shifted increasingly to the Pacific region, so the relative importance of the United States as an ally increased. But New Zealand's interests remained world-wide, and this was reflected in the policy of collaboration. There was never any question of reducing links with the United Kingdom and Europe in favour of those with the United States and the Pacific. Instead, in what was sometimes to prove a delicate balancing act, New Zealand policymakers looked to accommodate both old allies and new as they adapted to the succession of the United States to Britain's position of pre-eminent world power.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--History)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular approaches to horticultural crop improvement</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Ross G</field><field name="description">Plant biotechnology and molecular biology are now being used to complement conventional breeding programmes in most of the world's important crop species. The aim of the research described in this thesis was to improve New Zealand's horticultural crop plants through application of similar molecular techniques. A) Gene transfer systems for apple, pepino and tamarillo Tissue culture systems were developed for micropropagation and regeneration of apple (cv Royal Gala), pepino (cv El Camino) and tamarillo (selection Oratia Red). In all three species, transient expression of the gusA reporter gene was observed and kanamycin resistant callus was produced, following inoculation with the pKIWI110 binary vector in the avirulent Agrobacterium strain LBA4404. No transgenic apple shoots were obtained. However, transgenic pepino and tamarillo plants expressing the gusA reporter gene, kanamycin resistance and herbicide tolerance were successfully regenerated. PCR and Southern analysis provided molecular evidence for integration of foreign DNA into the genomes of transgenic pepino and tamarillo plants, but indicated deletions of the integrated T-DNAs had occurred with high frequency. Inheritance of the transgenic phenotypes was demonstrated in the progeny of transgenic tamarillo plants. B) Characterisation of polygalacturonase genes A kiwifruit genomic clone with homology to a tomato cDNA clone for polygalacturonase (PG) was sequenced over an 8.1 kb region. The sequence revealed a gene divided into nine exons, with 58% overall identity to the tomato PG gene at the amino acid level. Significant homology was also noted to PG genes isolated from peach, Oenothera organensis and maize, particularly in several blocks of conserved amino acids believed to encode the active site of the enzyme. Analysis of the kiwifruit PG promoter revealed three 81 bp direct repeat sequences just upstream of the kiwifruit peptide start codon. These repeats were also conserved in a second kiwifruit PC genomic clone. Characterisation of partial cDNA clones indicated that at least two mRNAs for PG were expressed in ripe kiwifruit. Southern hybridisation detected the PG gene at low copy number in the genomes of kiwifruit, two other Actinidia species, apple and pepino. PCR was used to amplify a fragment of the apple PG gene for sequence analysis. PG sequences were also used to help define the genetic origin of kiwifruit. A region of the PG gene was amplified and sequenced from four Actinidia species: kiwifruit (A. deliciosa), A. chinensis, A. eriantha and A. chrysantha. These sequences were used to produce a phylogeny using PAUP (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony). Two distinct lineages of PG genes were observed in the genomes of A. deliciosa, A. chinensis and A. eriantha. Within both these lineages, A. deliciosa sequences were quite distinct to those found in the other three Actinidia species, with the exception of a single sequence that was identical to A. chinensis. These results suggest that hexaploid kiwifruit is an allopolyploid with A. chinensis and at least one other Actinidia species as likely progenitors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biology)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributional relationships among subtidal algae, sea urchins and reef fish in northeastern New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Cole, Russell Gavin</field><field name="description">Interactions among large brown macroalgae, sea urchins, and fishes were investigated in northeastern New Zealand during the period 1988 - 1993. The Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve was the site of many of these investigations. The patterns of abundance of large brown macroalgae and urchins down depth gradients over a wide geographic range were compared with those reported from earlier studies, and 3 major trends were identified. First, the fucoid alga Carpophyllum flexuosum now occurs at many sites which are exposed to wave action, in contrast to earlier studies. This alga occurred most abundantly on urchin-grazed coralline flat areas. Second, at four sites in the Marine Reserve, the densities of the echinometrid urchin Evechinus chloroticus decreased with increasing depth, rather than reaching maximal densities at mid-depths, as had previously been described. Finally, at sites of decreased exposure to wave action, the coralline flats habitat did not occur at all, and dense stands of. C. flexuosum occurred, in conjunction with the ubiquitous laminarian alga, Ecklonia radiata. Following the discovery of this new algal component to exposed rocky reefs, a more detailed study of its population characteristics was initiated. The population size structure of C. flexuosum on coralline flat areas was markedly different from that of the same species in sites sheltered from wave action. These differences occurred at both offshore islands and sites near Leigh, suggesting that it was a general pattern. C. flexuosum plants on coralline flats were smaller than those from sheltered sites, and had a greater number of smaller laminae, heavier stipes, and a greater degree of branching. There was some evidence of temporal change in the morphology of C. flexuosum from coralline flats. Comparisons between a site with C. flexuosum and a site with coralline flats suggested that the activity of fish was 75% lower in the vegetated than in the unvegetated site, and the feeding rate in the vegetated site was less than 50% that in the unvegetated site. I speculate that future effects on fish activity of the invasion of C. flexuosum into a habitat which previously lacked macroalgal vegetation may depend on changes in the morphology of plants. An investigation of many aspects of the biology of E. chloroticus in different habitats was undertaken. Analysis of the body dimensions of E. chloroticus suggested that this species was relatively tall compared to other echinometrids (average ratio of test height: test diameter = 0.54), Comparisons among habitats with differing amounts of vegetation revealed only small differences in the relationship between test diameter and test height. Small E. chloroticus (&lt;40 mm test diameter) lived in crevices, while larger individuals grazed freely over the substratum. In vegetated habitats, the crevice-dwelling habit was maintained at test diameters about l0 mm greater than in unvegetated habitats. Very small (&lt;20 mm test diameter) E. chloroticus frequently covered themselves with shell. Population size structures of E. chloroticus within the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve were bimodal; other localities had unimodal populations. Modal sizes varied among localities, with smallest modes (50-60 mm TD) being found at Inner Hauraki Gulf sites, and largest modes at the offshore Mokohinau Islands (70-80 mm TD). Habitat did not predictably affect population size structure. A bimodal population structure was maintained at Waterfall Reef rock flats throughout the 5-year study period. Gonad size showed seasonal fluctuations at several sites, being greatest in summer. There were few consistent differences in gonad size between biological habitats. Gonad colour varied among sites and habitats, with orange gonads generally being more prevalent in vegetated habitats, and black gonads being represented more in unvegetated habitats. Smaller urchins had greater proportions of orange gonads, while larger urchins had greater proportions of brown and black gonads. Although highly variable among individual urchins, movement of E. chloroticus was greater at unvegetated sites (0.7 m per 5 days) than at vegetated sites (0.4 m per 5 days), in the Marine Reserve. Feeding of E. chloroticus was studied at a number of sites in the Marine Reserve. Urchins frequently consumed drift algae, particularly E. radiata. C. flexuosum was consumed at less than half the rate of other macroalgae in several laboratory feeding experiments, and was chosen least frequently in a field assay of feeding preferences among 8 species of macroalgae. Boosting densities of E. chloroticus in stands of E. radiata to 60 m-2 led to destructive grazing of plants over a 2 month period - at lower densities, the urchins dispersed. Densities of C. flexuosum were effectively unchanged when urchin densities were increased to these elevated levels. As a result of these observations I speculate that feeding preferences of E. chloroticus may have a role in allowing C. flexuosum to survive on coralline flats. In a laboratory experiment, urchins from a feeding aggregation did not graze algae at higher rates than individuals from outside aggregations. Diets of both E. radiata and C. flexuosum consistently produced similar gonad volumes in urchins held in the laboratory, although gonad volumes produced were low. A preliminary experiment suggested that C. flexuosum from exposed sites was consumed at lower rates than C. flexuosum from sites which were sheltered from wave action. These differences in palatability are mirrored in the formation of stable borders between coralline flats and C. flexuosum of the sheltered morphology, and the ability of C. flexuosum of the exposed morphology to survive in the coralline flats habitat. The fish fauna of the Cape Rodney to Okakari Point Marine Reserve was shown to be different from that of a nearby area. A number of species were more abundant within the Marine Reserve. Subsequent surveys showed that there were differences in abundances of 3 large carnivorous fishes among sites within the Marine Reserve, and that population size structure and the distance within which divers could approach one species, (Pagrus auratus), clearly varied between areas within the Marine Reserve. Mean standard length of P. auratus in the central marine reserve was 40% larger than that of P. auratus outside the central marine reserve, and the average minimum approach distance was 70% less in the central marine reserve. Feeding of fish by humans in the central part of the Marine Reserve was suggested to be the main cause of the differences in responses to divers. Population size structure of, and crevice occupancy by, E. chloroticus, clearly differed between the Marine Reserve and an adjacent area, with bimodal population size structures and a 10 mm greater size of crevice occupancy occurring in the Marine Reserve. The implications of these findings for extrapolating from experiments done in one area to other areas are discussed. The major biological components of rocky reef habitats identified in this study were broadly similar to those identified in previous studies in northeastern New Zealand, and have parallels in overseas studies. Long term changes to the flora of rocky reefs in northeastern New Zealand have occurred, and appear to persist by a mechanism which had previously been discounted. Similar processes to those observed in overseas studies appear to maintain habitats (consistent recruitment of algae or urchins to habitats which they dominate), or cause them to change from one habitat state to another (e.g. grazing outbreaks by urchins). However, the predictability of the persistence of these habitats at a particular site appears to be low. Further, the precise mechanisms whereby habitats may change from one to another may also be unpredictable. I argue that there is little scope for general statements concerning the spatial and temporal occurrence, or mode, of habitat transitions on temperate subtidal reefs. This study emphasises the value of repeated descriptions of patterns of abundance, and highlights problems of extrapolation and generalisation in marine ecology. Insufficient information exists at present to comment adequately on the persistence of subtidal habitat types. This may in part stem from the types of information which have been collected in the past. Methodological problems with the use of quadrats to sample densities of organisms in areas of differing topography are therefore addressed. In conclusion, it is suggested that sampling protocols which incorporate a variety of information, gathered over as wide an area, and as intensively as possible, should be used in future research of this type.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1912</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Atomic Trampoline Cavity</field><field name="creator">Liston, Gregory John</field><field name="description">Using an intense evanescent light wave as the lower mirror, and the gravitational force as the upper mirror, a vertical cavity for storing atoms can be constructed. Transverse confinement is obtained by totally internally reflecting the light off a concave as opposed to a planar crystal surface, which results in any atom reflected by the evanescent potential at a position away from the central axis receiving an impulse towards it. After a cursory discussion of atom optics and atomic cavities, we outline the configuration of the atomic trampoline cavity described above, and present analysis of the motion of atoms within it. A discussion of the classical dynamics and quantum modes in the cavity is given, together with other complicating factors which act as loss mechanisms out of the cavity. Various aspects of obtaining experimental realizations and applications of the cavity are considered. A detailed study of the quantum dynamics of atoms in the three dimensional cavity reveals that the dispersion can be adequately described in the transverse directions using a simulation involving a classical distribution of point-like atoms, where the probability density of finding an atom at a particular position in the simulation corresponds to the probability density of the atomic wavefunction. The classical simulations, however, significantly underestimate the spreading in the vertical direction. By calculating the modes of the atomic trampoline cavity, both in and out of the evanescent potential, the proportion of each of the modes in the excited state, and hence the decay rate, or linewidth due to spontaneous emission can be calculated. We found that even when the effect of the evanescent potential was included, the modes obtained correspond to those calculated by Wallis, Dalibard and Cohen-Tiennoudji [Appl. Phys. B 54,407 (1992)], who treated the bottom potential as infinitely steep and not exponentially decaying. In contrast to an optical Fabry-P&#233;rot cavity, the linewidth was found to be strongly dependent on energy. Various other cavity parameters (finesse and Q) which depend on the loss due to spontaneous emission were also calculated. Using a ring cavity rather than a laser traveling wave to provide the light that totally internally reflects off the internal surface of the dielectric crystal, we can accumulate the phase change due to the single atom bouncing into and out of the evanescent wave and altering the refractive index of the cavity. A measurement of the phase of this light will reveal information about the atom. We found that the measurement did not significantly alter the mean or standard deviation of the atomic energy distribution across the modes of the cavity, as to first order the phase change of the light in the cavity is independent of the energy of the atom. The significant change in the energy distribution was the introduction of oscillations, which occurred when the phase measured was significantly different from the expected mean. The reason for these oscillations is that the measurement implies the weighting of modes just entering or leaving the evanescent wave should be increased or decreased. Ways of bringing this currently infeasible experiment closer to being achievable using novel design mechanisms are also discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Adolescent Mother and her Child: Determinants of Maternal Parenting Behaviour and Infant Development</field><field name="creator">Dixon, Robyn S.</field><field name="description">Despite having the second highest teenage pregnancy rate in the developed world, there has been an absence of New Zealand research investigating outcomes for the adolescent mother and her child The present study was designed as a first step toward redressing this situation. The aim of the study was twofold, to provide a descriptive profile of a sample of New Zealand women giving birth to their first child during adolescence, the primary aim being to identify psychosocial variables associated with maternal parenting behaviour and infant cognitive, motor and social development. One hundred and twenty, first time mothers aged between 15 years 6 months and 19 years and 9 months were interviewed in the post natal wards of Waitakere Maternity Unit in West Auckland. In addition to gathering extensive demographic data, measures of mothers' social support system, perceived stress, locus of control and knowledge of child development were taken. The second phase took place in the homes of the 80 subjects who were successfully located and agreed to further participate in the study. Again as part of this interview, demographic data were collected and, in addition to repeating the measures of social support and perceived stress, mother's satisfaction with her role as a parent was measured. Infant development was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Finally, a 10 minute videotape was made of mother-infant interaction. During this time mothers were asked to change the infant's nappy, and then to play with their baby using a selection of age appropriate toys provided by the researcher. Following analysis of the descriptive variables, multiple regression analysis was used to identify variables associated with maternal parenting behaviour and infant outcomes. This resulted in the development of a model of adolescent parenting which suggests that social support, particularly the size of a mother's supportive network and the availability of emotional support, has a direct effect on maternal psychological status, which in turn impacts on maternal parenting behaviours. A mother's satisfaction with parenting being especially important. As expected maternal parenting behaviour is associated with infant interaction behaviour. Moreover, social support and maternal psychological status both had a direct impact on infant mental development scores. Furthermore, the results of the study have highlighted the importance of including measures of parenting satisfaction in models of adolescent parenting, a variable which up until now has been missing in research in this area. Finally, the implications of the findings for education and health professionals, and policy makers, concerned with the well being of these young women and their children are highlighted, and directions for further research identified.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automata-Theoretic Models for Computational Complementarity</field><field name="creator">Calude, Elena</field><field name="description">The purpose of this Thesis is to study, from the mathematical point of view, a new type of questions about finite automata, questions motivated by looking at automata as toy models of physical particles. Working along the line of research initiated by Moore, two computational complementarity principles are studied, (for finite-deterministic, complete or incomplete, nondeterministic-automata with outputs but no initial states) both theoretically and experimentally; they mimic the physical complementarity and the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen effect. Automata are studied via simulations (informally, the automaton A is simulated by the automaton B if B can perform all computations A can execute and produces the same outputs; two automata are equivalent in case they simulate each other). A new type of minimization problem will be solved and the solution is proved to be unique up to an isomorphism; the minimal automaton equivalent to a given automaton can be constructed only in terms of outputs for deterministic complete or incomplete automata, but one needs the whole internal machinery for nondeterministic automata. It happens that minimal automata are exactly the automata which may feature computational complementarity. Even if the original motivation will remain only metaphorical, the physical motivation was good to suggest new definitions and constructions (simulation, universality, complementarity) leading to new mathematical results (existence of universal finite automaton, solving in a new way the minimalization problem for nondeterministic automata).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Computer Science)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1915</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biochemical and Molecular characterisation of Trichoderma species.</field><field name="creator">Dodd-Wilson, Sarah Louise</field><field name="description">The growing importance of many Trichoderma strains as biological control agents and producers of valuable metabolites and enzymes has made their distinction from other Trichoderma isolates essential. However, the use of morphological and cultural characters alone to differentiate individuals within the genus Trichoderma to a level that is most informative has proved difficult due to a lack of reliable characters. In this study, alternative biochemical and molecular techniques were assessed for their ability to differentiate between isolates of the genus Trichoderma. Fifty isolates representing the Trichoderma species T. atroviride, T. hamatum, T. inhamatum, T. koningii, T. virens, T. viride and five morphological sub-groupings of the T. harzianum species were examined. ITS sequence data, RAPD PCR and the ability of an isolate to produce the metabolite 6-pentyl-&#945;-pyrone (PAP) were all used to differentiate between morphologically indistinguishable isolates. Altogether four levels of variation were recognised. The greatest level of resolution was achieved with the RAPD PCR technique, followed by both morphological characters and sequence data from the ITSI region of the ribosomal gene complex. Sequence data from the ITS2 region provided the third level of resolution. The fourth level of resolution was achieved with both sequence data from the second variable region (D2) of the 28S-like ribosomal gene and determination of an isolate's ability to produce the metabolite PAP. Based on these results, it was proposed that a new taxonomic system be established in which individuals of the genus Trichoderma are distinguished by a combination of morphological, cultural. biochemical and molecular characters. Sequence data and RAPD PCR data were also tested for their reliability in estimating the phylogeny of Trichoderma. Sequence data from the ITSI region proved to be the most reliable for predicting the phylogeny of morphologically defined species, whereas RAPD data was most useful for predicting the unrooted phylogeny of strains of morphologically identical isolates (i.e. isolates with less than 10% nucleotide divergence). None of the data employed in the present study were able to resolve all the species tested. It was concluded that additional sequence from a more variable region would be required to achieve this. In addition to the characterisation and phylogenetic studies, two approaches were undertaken in an attempt to isolate a gene(s) vital to the production of the antifungal metabolite PAP, a metabolite believed to be important in the biological control activity of a number of the isolates under investigation. Both attempts were unsuccessful and additional studies undertaken to determine how important PAP is in the biological control activity of Trichoderma isolates were inconclusive. Nevertheless, a natural PAP deficient mutant was identified among the 50 isolates under investigation. Furthermore, synthetic PAP was found to inhibit the infection of lentil seedlings by Sclerotium rolfsii when 10 mg was added to a pot containing six seedlings and three viable sclerotia of the pathogen. The metabolite did not appear to have any detrimental effects on the growth and development of the seedlings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Plant Science (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Paraplegic Bodies: Self and Society</field><field name="creator">Sullivan, Martin Joseph</field><field name="description">In this dissertation it is argued that humans constitute themselves as subjects in a complex of interrelationships between body, self, and society, The effects of these interrelationships are examined through the ways in which traumatic paraplegics constitute themselves as subjects following their accidents.

Kilmartin The conductive properties of films of polyaniline, substituted polyanilines, polypyrrole and polythiophene formed on platinum electrodes have been studied using photoelectrochemical, spectroscopic and surface science techniques. Bands due to oxidised and reduced forms of the polymers were monitored using in situ Raman spectroscopy, with polyaniline giving separate bands and polypyrrole showing an apparent shift of the main &#957;CC mode by 35 cm-1 V-1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy allowed the elements of the polymers to be quantified into their various oxidation states, particularly through a deconvolution of the N 1s peak. Microscopic mounds of polymer were seen under atomic force microscopy consistent with the extent of polymer growth. The current response to a light flash perturbation on a milli-second time scale provided new information about the conducting polymers. For polyaniline in an insulating state, short-lived photocurrents were observed (less than 1.5 ms), while for polyaniline in a conductive state, longer-lasting photocurrents were observed (greater than 1.5 ms). Prolonged photocurrents indicative of high conductivity were observed up to a pH of 3.7, beyond which only shorter transients were obtained, consistent with previous polyaniline conductivity studies. The transition from conducting to insulating regions at more positive potentials was marked by the appearance of a short-lived cathodic photoresponse, which occurred at more positive potentials as the pH was lowered. Two models are proposed to account for the photocurrents. In the insulating state, the polyaniline film functions as a capacitance, with the fast transients being caused by discharge of surface states. In the conductive state, the prolonged anodic and cathodic photocurrents arise from redox processes with expulsion of solution species. Consistent with these models, polypyrrole showed only cathodic photocurrents (with anion release) and sulfonated polyaniline only anodic photocurrents (release of protons). The stable yellow film of parathiocyanogen (SCN)x formed by oxidation of SCN- at a platinum electrode in warm methanolic solution was studied, and was shown to be insulating and electroinactive, with short-lived photocurrents unless exposed to potentials greater than 1 V. Oxidation of SeCN- in aqueous solutions produced an analogous, though less stable, orange paraselenocyanogen film.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dealing with dilemmas: a critical and collaborative approach to staff appraisal in two schools</field><field name="creator">Cardno, Carol E.M.</field><field name="description">central intent of 'Tomorrow's Schools' reforms in New Zealand was to make schools more accountable for improving the quality of teaching by devolving responsibility for staff appraisal to principals. The researcher sought to discover what kind of dilemmas arose for two principals in the context of implementing staff appraisal policy and how their theories of practice constrained their ability to resolve complex problems. Further questions were asked about how viable it would be to mount a critical and collaborative intervention to alter practice, how the impact of the intervention could be evaluated, and what the implications of this research might be for training principals. The research shows that appraisal activity poses leadership dilemmas arising out of tensions between concern to meet organisational goals and concern for relationships among individuals. The principals responded by suppressing these dilemmas and avoiding threat with consequent ineffectiveness in the resolution of problems. Intervention within a framework of action research involved teaching the participants how to discover, critique and alter the values and beliefs which governed the defensive strategies that were counterproductive to their intentions to be open and inclusive. The result of the intervention was that the schools developed appraisal policies that disclosed purposes related to both accountability and staff development. At the Interpersonal level the principals' attempts to counter unilaterally controlling and protective tendencies in their behaviour were blocked whilst in dialogue with others by their inability to articulate the conflict in values which was at the source of their appraisal dilemmas. The research illustrates the complexity and challenges inherent in learning the theoretical and practical curriculum in order to recognise conflict, respond to it, and develop critical dialogue skills. The research concludes that training programmes for school leaders should accord significance to the expectations held of principals to perform a dual role as evaluators and developers of staff. A problem-based, interventionist form of training is recommended. Such training should focus on developing competence in critical and collaborative approaches for dealing with appraisal dilemmas.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1920</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of Natural Products Containing Hydroxylated Pyrrolidines</field><field name="creator">Park, Jae Hyun</field><field name="description">This thesis contains two parts.

The range of applications of hypermedia systems - in many academic and non-academic areas - is continually growing. This thesis addresses hypermedia support for university activities. During the last few years. many universities have started to build up a large campus-wide information system (CWIS) based or a networked hypermedia system connected to the Internet. In this thesis a more advanced form of CWIS, the so-called University Transaction, Information, and Communication System (UTICS) is introduced. UTICS is based on the distributed hypermedia system Hyper-G and additional stand-alone hypermedia systems. UTICS was designed to serve as framework for a collection of research efforts, aiming at exploring advanced applications for hypermedia systems in universities. The research covered in this thesis includes the following areas: (i) advanced hypermedia presentation systems for public relations exercises, including virtual walk/fly-throughs and interactive telewatching, (ii) automated preparation and updating of hypermedia documents, (iii) support for teaching, in particular the authoring and distribution of interactive courseware, (iv) publishing of electronic reference material, (v) hypermedia support for the organization of conferences, and (vi) future evolution of large-scale hypermedia systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Computer Science)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation into 'Public Choice' Theory and its Implications for Education in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Devine, Nesta</field><field name="description">'Public Choice Theory' is defined by its proponents as 'the application of economics to politics'. This thesis attempts to describe Public Choice Theory in its component parts and as a coherent and potent contemporary factor in the political and educational scene. The methodologies used are Foucauldian 'genealogy' and 'immanent critique', that is, the theory is examined in its historical context and in terms of its own logic. The process by which this theory has affected the educational situation in New Zealand is examined, and set in the context of the wider application of economics to politics in this country generally. Some of the major policy documents concerning Education are read closely in order to identify the extent of the Public Choice Theory influence on them, Whilst Public Choice Theory is commonly associated with the 'New Right' it is also the key element of 'analytic Marxism'. Whether from 'left' or 'right,' Public Choice Theory, as a basis for the content or organisation of education is presented as a historically contingent theory, making dubious claims to scientific validation, and bringing about consistent changes in the nature of education and the construction of persons engaged in it.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reacting to a &#8216;Discovered&#8217; Social Problem Through Organisational Adaptation: Case Studies of Child Sexual Abuse Investigation of Seven New Zealand Police Districts</field><field name="creator">Burgering, Wendy Helen Miller</field><field name="description">Organisations operate in an environment buffeted by social change. Child sexual abuse became publicly recognised as a social problem from 1986. The first part of this thesis examines public awareness of, and interest in child sexual abuse, how child sexual abuse arose in New Zealand, the influence of international "moral entrepreneurs" in shaping this recognition and the activities of local "moral entrepreneurs"' including some police officers, in assisting the move of child sexual abuse from the private to the public arena. The second part of this thesis examines organisational change and whether the causes for organisational change are environmentally or managerially driven. Or is it, as this thesis suggests a combination of both. This thesis takes these theoretical arguments and applies them to the process of organisational change that occurred in the New Zealand Police Department, from the development and implementation of the National Abuse Policy for the investigation of child sexual abuse and serious physical abuse. The third part of this thesis examines the interlinking between the main theoretical foci, organisational change and the construction of a social problem. The results of an investigation from key staff, Police and other agency personnel, from seven New Zealand Police Department Districts, interviewed in three waves over a two and a half year period, are reported. The total number of key staff from each wave was 93, 80 and 68. The results of the first part of the thesis is that through effective lobbying by the women's movement and child protection groups child sexual abuse has become a recognised social problem. In the second part of the thesis the following were found to be crucial factors in the shaping of organisational responses to child sexual abuse: The role of middle managers in the implementation of organisational change policies in assigning or not assigning appropriate resources. The role of the top management in the ownership of organisational change policies the procedures. Continual staff turnover and the policy of staff rotation limited the successful implementation and continued support for the National Abuse Policy. This factor, staff turn over and/or rotation, will impact on the success of any organisational change policy. The extent of the training provisions for police officers at all levels within the organisation and the maintenance of that training at a national and district level. Acceptance of the multidisciplinary investigative approach which differed from more traditional policing approaches. The internal and external pressure on the Police to implement and maintain a high profile response in the child sexual abuse field. The results of the third part of the thesis is that the Police Department played a role in the public recognition of child sexual abuse as a social problem and as a result had to implement an operational response through the development of a National Abuse Policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Sociology)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes</field><field name="creator">Salter, David Mark</field><field name="description">The chemistry of transition metal silyl complexes still remains relatively undeveloped despite the recent advances that have been made in this area. This thesis describes the synthesis and reactivity of new ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes. A general survey on the bonding, preparation and reactivity of transition metal silyl complexes is given in chapter one as an introduction to the chemistry discussed in the following chapters. Several reviews relating to transition metal-silicon chemistry have been published, 1-5 and therefore only the major features and more recent developments are highlighted in this overview. Emphasis has been placed on those aspects not previously reviewed. Coordinatively unsaturated transition metal silyl complexes are uncommon and the chemistry of these complexes has been virtually unexplored. The synthesis of the novel coordinatively unsaturated ruthenium and osmium silyl complexes, M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os; R=Cl, alkyl group, alkoxy group), is described in chapter two. The reaction of M(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os) with a silane, in some instances, provided a facile, high yield route to complexes of the type M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru; SiR3=SiMe3, SiEt3, SiCl3, SiMe2Cl; M=Os; SiR3=SiCl3, SiMe2Cl). The chlorosily1 complexes were also prepared by treatment of MHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 (M=Ru, Os) with HSiCl3 and HSiMe2Cl. X-ray crystal structures were obtained of Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and Os(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. Complexes containing chlorosily1 ligands proved synthetically useful, undergoing a variety of nucleophilic substitution reactions at silicon with retention of the transition metal-silicon bond. New complexes synthesized by this method included Ru[Si(OEt)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and Os(SiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. X-ray crystal structures of these two compounds were also obtained. These exchange reactions illustrate a route to new transition metal silyl compounds that has rarely been utilised. Also described in chapter two is the unprecedented formation of the novel compound Os(SiMe2C6H4PPh2)(C6H4PPh2)(CO)(PPh3), resulting from phenylation at silicon. The structure of this complex was determined by X-ray crystallography. In chapter three, addition of the Lewis bases CO and CN(p-tolyl) to coordinatively unsaturated silyl complexes, M(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os), is described. The coordinatively saturated osmium silyl complexes Os(SiR3)Cl(CO)L(PPh3)2 (SiR3=SiCl3, SiMe2Cl, SiMe2OEt, SiMe3; L=CO, CNR) were generated in this way. Similarly, addition of 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine to Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 afforded Ru(siEt3)Cl(dimethylbipy)(CO)(PPh3). The six-coordinate complex Ru(SiEt3)(&#951;2-S2CNMe2)(CO)(PPh3)2 was synthesized by displacement of the labile chloride ligand from Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 by the dimethyldithiocarbamate anion. Characterization of Ru(SiEt3)(&#951;2-S2CNMe2)(CO)(PPh3)2 included an X-ray crystallographic analysis. The exchange of silyl groups at the metal was also observed in several reactions. For example, heating Ru(SiMe3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 in the presence of excess HSiEt3 yielded Ru(SiEt3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. These reactions illustrate aspects of the chemistry that can occur at the metal centre of coordinatively unsaturated transition metal silyl complexes. Another route to coordinatively saturated osmium silyl complexes was via oxidative addition of a silane to Os(CO)2(PPh3)3, which yielded Os(SiR3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2 (SiR3=SiMe3, SiEt3, SiPh3, SiPh2H). The synthesis of these complexes is also discussed in chapter three. An X-ray crystal structure determination of Os(SiEt3)H(CO)2(PPh3)2 confirmed the presence of mutually trans carbonyl ligands. The first thiocarbonyl-containing transition metal silyl complexes, M(SiMe2Cl)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (M=Ru, Os), were prepared by treating M(Ph)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 or MHCl(CS)(PPh3)3 with HSiMe2Cl. The Si-Cl bond in these compounds reacted readily with nucleophiles, yielding M(SiMe2OR)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (OR=OEt, OMe, OH). In contrast to the addition of CO to Os(SiR3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, addition of CO to Ru(SiMe2R)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 (R=Cl, OEt, OMe, OH) and to Os(SiMe2OEt)Cl(CS)(PPh3)2 afforded dihapto-thioacyl complexes, M[&#951;2-C(S)SiMe2R]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, via a migratory insertion reaction involving the silyl group and the thiocarbonyl ligand. This reaction represents the first formal insertion of CS into a transition metal-silicon bond. The structure of Ru[&#951;2-C(S)SiMe2OEt]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was obtained by X-ray crystallography and confirmed that bonding of the thioacyl ligand occurred in a dihapto fashion. These reactions are described in chapter four. When Os(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was reacted with HSiMe3, the formally osmium(IV) silyl complex Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 was produced. Few compounds of this type are known. The synthesis, characterization and reactivity of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 are discussed in chapter five. The crystal structure of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 is also depicted. In solution, Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 appeared to be in equilibrium with the highly reactive, coordinatively unsaturated species OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. The reaction of Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 with HSiR3 (R=Et, Ph), HSn(p-tolyl)3 and HC2Ph was carried out, using Os(SiMe3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 as an in situ source of OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. These reactions afforded Os(SiR3)H3(CO)(PPh3)2 (R=Et, Ph), Os[Sn(p-tolyl)3]2H2(CO)(PPh3)2 and OsH(C2Ph)(CO)(PPh3)3 respectively, most likely via a series of oxidative addition-reductive elimination reactions involving OsH2(CO)(PPh3)2. Transition metal hydroxysilyl complexes are extremely rare. Only three systems have been reported containing a hydroxysilyl group bonded to a transition metal. 6,7,8 Chapter six deals with the formation of compounds of this type. Hydroxysilyl-containing complexes of ruthenium and osmium were obtained via the hydrolysis of M(SiMe2Cl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 and M(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. The complexes M[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 are the first trihydroxysilyl-containing transition metal complexes and therefore represent a new class of transition metal silyl compounds. Characterization of Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 included an X-ray crystal structure which showed that, remarkably, no inter- or intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of the type O(H)&#183;&#183;&#183;O or O(H) &#183;&#183;Cl was associated with the Si(OH)3 group. In contrast, intermolecular hydrogen bonding was found by X-ray crystallography for the dicarbonyl derivative, Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)2(PPh3)2. Subsequent reactions involving Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 led to the synthesis of the diosmium tetrahydroxydisiloxane complex, [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O. For example, [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O was isolated after Os(SiCl3)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 was added to a dichloromethane solution of Os[Si(OH)3]Cl(CO)(PPh3)2. Formation of this tetrahydroxydisiloxane compound is significant and models the first condensation reaction generating a Si-O-Si linkage in the hydrolysis of organochlorosilanes to polysiloxanes. The Si-O-Si linkage was clearly visible in the X-ray crystal structure of [OsCl(CO)(PPh3)2Si(OH)2-]2O. Chapter seven provides a short conclusion, highlighting the important features of the work discussed in this thesis and identifies areas for future investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1965</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum interactions of light and atoms: squeezing of light by atoms and cooling of atoms by light</field><field name="creator">Blockley, Craig Andrew</field><field name="description">Light and atoms couple together via the electromagnetic interaction. The simplest form of this interaction is the electric dipole interaction, and in its quantised form it provides a useful starting point for the investigation of quantum effects in optics. Two examples of quantum noise manipulation of the light field due to interaction with atoms will be presented, as well as an analysis of a simple model for laser cooling of trapped atoms. The first example of quantum noise manipulation is the investigation of a quantum non-demolition measurement scheme based on a three-level atomic system in the ladder configuration. An effective two-level model of the atomic system is used, which enables the inclusion of spontaneous emission noise from the upper atomic level. The system is found to perform well, when detuned far from resonance. The second example is the treatment of squeezing in the intensity difference between two modes coupled by a three-level atomic system in the ladder configuration. The noise correlations are similar to those occurring in the optical parametric oscillator, and give rise to good squeezing when the system is well detuned from the intermediate level. The simple model of laser cooling consists of a single two-level atom with quantised centre-of-mass motion constrained to move in a one-dimensional harmonic potential while interacting with a single-mode classical travelling light field. It is shown that there is an analogy between this model and the Jaynes-Cummings model. This gives rise to interesting coherent effects including quantum collapses and revivals in the atomic inversion. Sideband cooling occurs for this model when the light field is tuned to the atom's first lower vibrational sideband. The strong sideband and Lamb-Dicke perturbation regimes are defined. Analytic results have previously been obtained for the latter regime, but we carry out a numerical investigation of the steady state and time evolution behaviour in the former regime. Differences in the behaviour in the two regimes are discussed. Finally the possibility of observing quantum jumps between trap levels is discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular response of wheat roots to aluminium stress</field><field name="creator">Snowden, Kimberley Cathryn</field><field name="description">Aluminium (Al) toxicity to plants is a significant problem, limiting agricultural production in up to 40% of the world's arable soils. In spite of a large amount of research, there is still no consensus on the physiological mechanisms of Al toxicity in plants. In addition, very little is known about the molecular response of plants to Al stress. This body of research was aimed at identifying the changes in gene expression that occurred in the root tips of plants that had been stressed with Al. A cDNA library made from the root tips of Al-treated wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cultivar Warigal) plants was differentially screened to identify clones whose expression was induced by Al stress. Seven cDNA clones, representing five different genes were identified as being induced in the presence of Al. Initial sequencing and northern analysis revealed that none of the clones isolated were full-length, and that some contained multiple cloning adaptors at their 5' ends. A new cDNA library was then constructed from the root tips of Al-treated Warigal plants, and homologues to each of the original five genes were isolated. These five clones were named wali1 to wali5 (for wheat aluminium induced). Northern analysis showed that wali1, -3 and -5 were induced 24 to 96 h after Al treatment, and their expression declined when the Al was removed. wali4 had a similar pattern of expression with a transient increase in expression also observed after 0.5 h of Al stress. Each of these four genes was induced by inhibitory concentrations of Al in two wheat cultivars - Warigal, an Al-sensitive cultivar, and Waalt, an Al-tolerant cultivar, - and also in two inbred lines of wheat, RR (Al-tolerant) and SS (Al-sensitive). The fifth gene (wali2) had a bimodal pattern of induction, and was induced by Al only in the Al-sensitive Warigal and the Al-tolerant RR. The nucleotide sequence of each of the wali clones was determined, and the databases were searched for homologous sequences. Wali1 was found to be homologous to a group of metallothionein-like proteins (MLPs) from plants, and wali4 was homologous to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). wali3 and wali5 encode related, cysteine-rich proteins with homology to Bowman-Birk proteinase inhibitors, and wali2 encodes a novel protein with a repeating motif of cysteine amino acids. The induction of the wali genes was investigated in response to a number of other stresses through northern analysis. The expression of wali1, -3, -4 and -5 was induced in root tips of wheat after 2 d treatments with toxic levels of all other metals tested (Cd, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ga, In and La). The expression levels of wali1, -3, -4, and -5 also increased in the root tips of plants grown in the presence of low levels of Ca (10&#956;M). The transcript levels of wali1, -3 and -5 increased in wounded leaf and root tissue, whereas the transcript levels of wali4 increased only in wounded leaves. The expression of wali2 was greatly reduced by low concentrations of Ca, and showed no induction, or a variable response with most of the other treatments. The site of expression of wali1, -2, -3 and -5 in root tips (and wali1 also in leaf tissue) was identified using in situ hybridisation. Wali1 was expressed predominantly in the meristematic tissue of the root tip, while wali3 and wali5 were expressed predominantly in the cortical tissue of the root. wali2 expression was detected primarily in the epidermis and root cap. Some changes in the site of expression of these genes were evident in the roots of Al-treated plants. In leaf tissue, wali1 expression was found in the mesophyl1 layer of cells. The coding sequences for wali1,-2,-3 and -5 were each cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T. The resultant fusion proteins between glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the walis were then successfully purified from E coli. Antibodies were made to the wali1-GST fusion protein and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. However, when used in western analysis, no specific bands corresponding to the native wali1 protein were identified. The wali2-GST protein was used in a south-western procedure to determine if the protein was capable of binding DNA, but no DNA binding to this protein was detected under the conditions tested. The wali3 and wali5 fusion proteins were tested in proteinase inhibitor assays, where no inhibition of either trypsin or chymotrypsin was detected. It is possible that the native wali3 and wali5 proteins may not function as proteinase inhibitors, or that the lack of activity detected for the fusion proteins may be due to incorrect folding or processing in the bacterial system. This research constitutes the first identification of plant genes whose expression is increased by Al stress. The genes identified are also induced in response to other environmental and nutrient stresses, indicating that they form part of the plant's general response to stress.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cellular and Molecular Biology (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1967</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Midwifery and maternity services in transition: An Examination of change following The Nurses Amendment Act 1990</field><field name="creator">Abel, Sally</field><field name="description">The Nurses Amendment Act 1990 enabled midwives in New Zealand/Aotearoa to care for women throughout normal childbirth on their own responsibility, without the supervision of a medical practitioner, as had previously been the case. The Act brought about significant changes to midwives' scope of practice, pay and status which had important implications for women's care, midwifery, the relationship between midwifery and medicine and the structure of maternity services. Three years after the passage of the Act, in July 1993, major restructuring of the health system along market principles began. From this time, consultation began for new maternity services arrangements, which fitted within the philosophy and structure of the new health system and which aimed to rectify some of the perceived problems resulting from the initial implementation of the 1990 Act. The consultation process was to take three years. This thesis describes and critically analyses changes to midwifery and maternity services, particularly in the greater Auckland region, in the six years from the passage of the Nurses Amendment Act in August 1990 until the official introduction of the new maternity structure in July 1996. This was a period in which midwifery was establishing itself in a medically-dominated domain while, simultaneously, a significant ideological shift was occurring in the philosophy and structure of the health system. Using an ethnographic approach, which included extensive key informant interviews and participant observation at a range of meetings over a period of three years I investigated in depth both the process of change and the relations of power between interest groups (consumer representatives, midwifery, medicine, hospital managers and regional health authorities) within local and national maternity services arenas. These findings were analysed using Foucault's later work on power and his concept of governmentality. A range of factors, including some of the trends occurring within the public sector, weakened the medical profession's control of normal childbirth and facilitated midwifery's entry as a competing provider of maternity care. Strategies used by midwifery representatives to maintain and develop the occupation's autonomous status were often effective, albeit constantly challenged. Despite ongoing conflict and some polarisation between medicine and midwifery, in general, relations of power between the various interest groups in both local and national settings were found to be complex and contestable with unstable alliances forming around particular issues. However, the fluidity of these power relations and the gains made by midwifery operated within constraints imposed by the influence of neo-liberal policies on the development of the new maternity structure. This gave the government's agents, the regional health authorities, the controlling influence on maternity services policy. Although the professed aim of the new structure was a more women-centred service, there were limits to consumer influence on maternity services policy and fiscal imperatives took precedence over some consumer interests.

Because of the pesticide regulations in some of the countries to which New Zealand exports fruit, total protection from Botrytis stem end rot with current dicarboximide fungicides is not possible. The aim of this thesis was to investigate biological control measures for Botrytis stem end rot and Sclerotinia diseases of kiwifruit. More than 1000 microorganisms, isolated from the leaves and flowers of kiwifruit during spring and autumn, and selected from BCAs reported to be effective against B. cinerea and./or S. sclerotiorum, were tested in vitro for their antagonistic ability against B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum. Successful antagonists were those that, in dual culture on agar plates, produced a zone of inhibition, an area of browning of the pathogens, or grew rapidly over the pathogens and inhibited their growth. The fifty most promising isolates from the initial screen were tested on fruit for their ability to reduce Botrytis and Sclerotinia fruit rots. Mature kiwifruit were artificallv wounded and dual inoculated with a spore suspension of one of the fifty test organisms and either a conidial suspension of B. cinerea or a mycelial suspension of S. sclerotiorum. Following 8-12 weeks incubation in a cool store, fruit were assessed for Botrytis or Sclerotinia induced rot. Isolates of Bacillus spp., Epicoccum purpurascens, Pseudomonas sp. and Trichoderma. spp. reduced, Botrytis fruit rot from 92% (inoculated control) to 0%.Isolates of Alternaria spp., pestalotia sp. and a non-sporulating isolate also reduced the number of fruit rotting to some extent. Similarly, isolates of Bacillus spp., E purpurascens and Trichoderma spp. reduce d Sclerotinia fruit rot from 100% (inoculated control) to 0%. Isolates of Alternaria spp., Myrothecium verrucaria and Pestalotia sp. were also successful at reducing the level of Sclerotinia fruit rot. It was considered undesirable if potential biological control agents (BCAs) were able to colonize kiwifruit that were to be marketed for human consumption. In order to determine if microorganisms, shown to be effective in preventing Botrytis or Sclerotinia fruit rot, were capable of themselves colonizing fruit, isolations were made from fruit dual inoculated with B. cinerea, S. sclerotiorum and/or one of several BCAs. Strains of the BCAs Bacillus spp., Pseudomonas sp. and E. purpurascens were not found to be saprophytic on fruit. Isolates of Alternaria sp., Bacillus sp., E purpurascens, pestalotia sp., Pseudomonas sp. and T. harzianum significantly inhibited germination and germ tube elongation of B. cinerea conidia in vitro in a nutrient solution, over a 24 h period. For example, the presence of Alternaria alternata A6 spores in a nutrient solution reduced germination of B. cinerea conidia from 100% to 20%. The presence of E purpurascens A77 spores inhibited B. cinerea conidial germ tube elongation from &gt;840 pm (in control conidia) to 27 &#181;m. The presence of any one of the BCAs tested prevented germination of B. cinerea conidia in a non-nutrient water solution, in comparision to germination of up to 86% in controls. A spore or cell suspension of each of the isolates Bacillus sp.M60, E. purpurascens A77 and T. harzianum C65 were spray inoculated onto kiwifruit blossoms produced in vivo in the glasshouse, immediately prior to inoculation of the blossoms with a condial suspension of B. cinerea. Application of the BCAs were completely effective in preventing colonization of blossoms by B- cinerea conidia. The effectiveness of each of the isolates E. purpurascens A77,T. harzianum C65 and either Bacillus sp.M60 or M53 to reduce the viability of sclerotia of B. cinerea and S. sclerotiorum was tested in soil punnets. A spore or cell suspension of each respective BCA was applied to the surface of replicated punnets that were seeded with either B. cinerea or S. sclerotiorum. Following 8 weeks incubation, punnets were harvested and viability of sclerotia assessed. T. harzianum C65 and Bacillus sp. M60 significantly reduced the viability of B. cinerea sclerotia from 8 sclerotia/punnet (control) to 4 sclerotia/punnet. T. harzianum C65 and E. purpurascens A77 caused a significant reduction in apothecia production of S. sclerotiorum, from 2.7 apothecia/punnet (control) to 0.7 apothecia/punnet. Bacillus sp.M8 and E purpurascens A77 were tested for their ability to reduce Botrytis stem end rot and Sclerotinia field rot in a kiwifruit orchard. The isolates tested did not successfully reduce either disease. Possible explanations for this are discussed. In order to monitor the survival of particular isolates of BCAs in the field, a technique was developed to distinguish between individual strains of a BCA species. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to identify DNA polymorphisms within the genome of T. harzianum C65, in comparison with other strains of Trichoderma spp.. A sequence of polymorphic DNA was cloned, sequenced and used as a hybridization probe in southern blotting to enable T. harzianum c65 to be distinguished from other strains of Trichoderma spp.. From the results obtained in this study, it was considered that Bacillus M60, E purpurascens 477 and Pseudomonas M30 were the best isolates for the biological control of Botrytis stem end rot on kiwifruit. Further work to enable application of these isolates as postharvest BCAs is discussed. Of the isolates tested in this study, T. harzianum C65 was considered the best isolate for use against Sclerotinia diseases on kiwifruit. Methods of selecting more effective BCAs against S. sclerotiorum are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Plant Pathology)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1971</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructing a woman: gender, genre, and subjectivity in the autobiographical works of Sibilla Aleramo</field><field name="creator">Jacobs, Susan (Susan Mary)</field><field name="description">Both Sibilla Aleramo (1876-1960), one of Italy's most renowned and controversial women writers, and autobiography, as a generic minefield for debates on theories of the subject, have received a good deal of critical attention over the past fifteen years. The uncompromisingly autobiographical nature of Sibilla's work has been, at various times, revered and reviled, be it for what she says, or how she says it. My focus is precisely on the different forms she uses to write her self in four texts - a fictional autobiography, lyrical novel, epistolary novel and a diary - and how these construct, modify and deconstruct her self-representations in a continual process of intertextual reading and revising. Yet her texts resist easy classification. While sometimes confirming boundaries of genre and gender, they also constantly call them into question by exposing their limits, their intersection with fictional norms, and their shifting discursive affiliations. Because Sibilla was all her life concerned with gender, and the relationship of femininity to her writing, many aspects of her work appear relevant today. I explore how they anticipate feminist theories on the construction of female subjectivity in a combination of theory and autobiographical practice which highlights the interrelationship of the two. Here Sibilla's focus on the maternal is particularly indicative of this tendency, where it is woven into the generic structures of her texts as well as being an important focus of the autobiographical "story". Furthermore, her texts challenge the notion of self defined by male bias, and present opportunities for critical testing of autobiographical theories themselves by offering not one, but several, works for examination.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379901 Gender specific studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Italian)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1972</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading readings: some current critical debates about New Zealand literature and culture</field><field name="creator">Paul, Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis examines contemporary interpretations of a selection of important texts written by New Zealand women between 1910 and 1940, and also a film and film script written more recently (which are considered as re-readings of a novel by Mander). The thesis argues that, though reading or meaning-making is always an activity of construction there will, at any given moment, always be reasons for preferring one way of reading over another-a reading most appropriate to a situation or circumstances. This study is motivated by a desire to understand how literary criticism has changed in recent years, particularly under the influence of feminism, and how a reader today can make a choice among competing methods of interpretation. Comparisons are drawn between various possible readings of the texts in order to classify methods of reading, particularly nationalist and feminist reading strategies. The over-all tendency of the argument is to propose a more self-critical and self-conscious approach to reading, and to develop a materialist and historical approach which I see as particularly important to the New Zealand context in the 1990s.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Further insight into the Lewis histo-blood-group system as revealed from study of Polynesian and Caucasian plasma and erythrocyte glycosphingolipids</field><field name="creator">Henry, Stephen Michael</field><field name="description">This project involved the study of Lewis and related blood group glycosphingolipid isolated from individuals with normal and aberrant Lewis/secretor phenotypes. The objective was to find a biochemical basis for the unusual expression of Lewis and secretor phenotypes in Polynesians and to use this information to shed light on the "normal" expression of Lewis antigens. By using purified glycolipids, presenting them in the cell free environment of thin layer chromatography to Lewis antibodies and by determining structures by mass spectrometry it has been shown that: l. The Lec epitope is a terminal Gal&#946;1-3Gal sequence, and not an internal branch as proposed by Hanfland (Hanfland et a1.,1986). 2. Lec or H-5-1 are present in Lewis negative phenotypes and their consequent consumption by the Le and ,Se transferases resulting in the known Lea and Leb antigens can be seen in the Lewis positives. 3. Phenotypically Le(a-b-) individuals have small amounts of Lewis antigens. This clearly demonstrates that although the Lewis negative phenotype exists at the crude serological level, this phenotype is not an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon at the chemical level. This also allows it to be postulated that the le gene is probably partially active. 4. Le(a+b+) individuals have both Lea and Leb glycolipids in the erythrocyte membrane and in plasma. Observed phenotyping anomalies appear to be related to there being quantitatively less Leb-6 in the Polynesian Le(a+b+) erythrocyte membrane than in the Le(a-b+) membrane. 5. The Le(a+b-) phenotype of Polynesians is actually the Le(a+b+) phenotype but with serologically undetectable Leb. This allows it to be postulated that the nonsecretor gene (se) is absent in Polynesians. 6. Extended structures are present in most of the Polynesian samples which is in support of a postulated weak secretor gene (Sew). It now appears that the difference between the extended Lewis glycolipids of Caucasians and Polynesians is quantitative. The postulated, Sew transferase appears to be inefficient and allows for increased formation of elongated glycoconjugates (polyglycosylceramides) to result. 7. Reduced fucosyltransferase activity allows increased elongation of the precursor chain to occur, which allows it to be postulated that fucosylation of the precursor prevents, or at least markedly reduces, chain elongation. It is speculated that, as almost everyone is either Lewis and/or secretor positive, perhaps the prevention of chain elongation is a biological reason as to why the Lewis and Secretor polymorphisms exist. 8. Differences in ceramide patterns of Lewis active glycolipids suggests that the small intestinal tract is not the only origin of plasma glycolipids, or there is differential absorption. 9. There is no plasma glycolipid-based reason for there being increased H type 2 antigen reactivity in the Polynesian erythrocyte membrane, nor a reason for the H antigen association with the Le(a+b+) phenotype.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Population dynamics of juvenile snapper (Pagrus auratus) in the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Francis, Malcolm, 1954-</field><field name="description">The population dynamics of juvenile snapper, Pagrus auratus, were investigated in the Hauraki Gulf, north-eastern New Zealand, between 1982 and 1990. Attention focused on age and growth, temporal and spatial variation in abundance, and recruitment. Daily increment formation was validated in the sagittae of snapper up to about 160 days old. Increment width varied with time of year, and snapper age, and increments were not resolvable with a light microscope during winter. Increment counts inside a prominent metamorphic mark showed that larval duration was 18-32 days, and was inversely related to water temperature. Spawning dates were back-calculated from increment counts in settled juveniles, and ranged from September to March with a peak in November-January. The onset of spawning was temperature dependent. Fast-growing snapper had smaller sagittae than slow-growing snapper, indicating an uncoupling of otolith and somatic growth. Snapper gonads differentiated first as ovaries during the second year of life, and then some juveniles changed sex to become males during their third year. Sex change occurred before maturity, so snapper are functionally gonochoristic. Growth was slow during the larval phase, but increased rapidly after metamorphosis to about 0.6-0.9 mm.day-1. From the first winter, growth followed a well-defined annual cycle, with little or no growth during winter, and linear growth of 0.16-0.43 mm.day-1 during spring-autumn for 0+/1+ and 1+/2+ snapper. Snapper grew faster at higher temperatures. Trawl catch rates were affected by numerous gear and environmental factors, but probably provided reasonable estimates of snapper relative abundance. Recommendations are made for improving snapper trawl survey procedures. There was a strong annual abundance cycle in the Kawau region, peaking in spring, and declining to a minimum in winter. Snapper were patchily distributed at a spatial scale of 1-2 km, probably because of preference for specific micro-habitats. Year class strength of 1+ snapper varied 17-fold over seven years, and was strongly positively correlated with autumn sea surface temperature during the 0+ year. The strengths of the 1991 and 1992 year classes are predicted to be below average, and extremely weak, respectively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1976</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reductively triggered internal cyclisation reactions</field><field name="creator">Sykes, Bridget Maree</field><field name="description">Reductively triggered internal cyclisation reactions have been investigated as a prodrug system for the hypoxia selective release of aromatic nitrogen mustards. The observed pseudo-first-order rate coefficients of cyclisation of several model 2-aminoaryl-acetamides and propanamides have been measured. Cyclisation was observed to be strongly influenced by stereochemistry, whereas electron withdrawal from the amine-bearing ring resulted in a comparatively modest slowing of the rate of cyclisation. Protonation of the leaving group appeared to increase the rate of cyclisation, while changes in 4-substitution on the leaving amine had little effect on this rate. The cyclisation of 2-(2-aminophenyl) alkanamides was found to be subject to general catalysis by acidic buffer components, and rate determining formation of the tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed. Ring closure reactions of several 2-hydroxylaminophenylalkanamides have been studied by &#947;-radiolysis. HPLC methods have been developed for the separation of reduction and cyclisation products. Reduction stoichiometry implicates the hydroxylamine as the predominant reduction product of radiolysis of the 2-nitrophenylalkanamide precursors, which varied in the nature of substitution of the nitrobenzyl ring, 4-substitution of the leaving aniline, and overall geometry. Cyclisation via the hydroxylamino was observed to be significantly faster than that of its amino counterparts, and was similarly influenced by changes in geometry. The hydroxylamine undergoes a base catalysed, oxygen dependent reaction under aerobic conditions. This reaction did not appear to be influenced by the geometry of the compound. Substitution of the hydroxylamine-bearing ring with a carboxamide group (CONHR &#963;p = 0.36) lowered the pH at which hydroxylamino-amide cyclisation was slowest, compared with its unsubstituted counterpart. The reaction was found to be aided by electron-withdrawal from the leaving amine. Rate determining breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate has been proposed. Preliminary investigations have been made on 2-nitrophenyl alkyl esters and a 2,6-dinitrophenylamide prodrug system. Rapid, reductively triggered release of coupled phenols and amines has been observed from the nitro-esters and -amides, respectively. In contrast to amino-amide and hydroxylamino-amide cyclisation, gem-dimethyl substitution did not facilitate reductive release from the nitro-ester. The inability to measure the rates of reductive release in radiolysis solutions suggests that these reactions occur significantly faster than hydroxylamino-amide ring closure. Molecular mechanics calculations have been undertaken to investigate relationships between the geometry of 2-aminoarylalkanamides, and rates of cyclisation. The distance between, and angle of approach of the nucleophilic and electrophilic centres in the calculated minimum-energy conformer did not display a correlation with cyclisation rates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1977</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High-resolution measurements of rainfall</field><field name="creator">Hosking, J. G. (John G.)</field><field name="description">A field system capable of making high-resolution measurements of rainfall is described. The system incorporates a disdrometer, an array of high-resolution raingauges, a general-purpose data acquisition system and ancillary equipment. In an evaluation of the disdrometer, a theory allowing calculation of the effects of windspeed on detection efficiency is presented which has wide applicability. The raingauges are an improved design allowing 10-s temporal resolution of rainfall intensity and 100 m spatial resolution of rain-patch size when used in the array. An extensive data base of measurements made using the field system is described. Duration of rainfall is shown to be approximately log-normal and is consistent with a log-normal distribution of precipitation region size. The fractional duration of rainfall above a threshold intensity varies considerably between rain periods, a result which may be important for electromagnetic attenuation models. Estimation of the shapes of rain patches using the raingauge array is demonstrated and shows considerable promise. Raindrop fallspeeds, measured using the disdrometer, generally show much less deviation from stagnant air terminal velocities than indicated by previously reported results. Much of the spread in the results is shown to be consistent with instrumentation errors although significant residual deviations are still apparent; the fallspeeds are generally slower than stagnant air values would suggest. Measurements of the arrival rate of raindrops at the disdrometer indicate clustering of drops rather than the often assumed Poisson distribution. The clustering is associated with small drops and has reasonable correlation with rainfall intensity. Examination of the cross-correlation of arrival rates of different sized drops show results in contradiction to previous results; small drops are found to lead other sized drops.

(Pieridae), and soybean looper (SBL) (Thysanoplusia orichalcea (F.)) (Noctuidae). Current grower strategy to combat these pests is calendar-scheduled insecticide applications. The goal of this thesis is to develop pest management alternatives. The seasonality of these three pests is discussed. DBM and WB are each under biological control by a larval and a pupal parasitoid, but this natural control is not sufficient to allow economic harvests in cabbage and was not synchronized. No parasitoids of SBL were found. The importation of additional natural enemies is discussed. A scouting system of the percent of cabbage plants infested coupled with an action threshold of. 15%-20% infested plants, resulted in good yields in field trials and allowed up to a 50% reduction in insecticide applications over the growth period when compared to a 14-day calendar schedule. Implementation of the 15% infested threshold in commercial cabbage fields resulted in up to an 83% reduction in insecticide applications with no yield decrease in quality or quantity. Application of this 15% infested plant threshold to broccoli and cauliflower decreased insecticide applications by 40% and 17%, respectively. Study of larval biology indicated that all of the lepidopterans preferentially fed on leaves; timing of the first insecticide application in broccoli and cauliflower to coincide with floret initiation decreased insecticide applications by 80% and 67%, respectively. Laboratory and field trials comparing DBM oviposition preference, larval survivability, and parasitism rates between cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower are discussed. Knowledge of lepidopterous pest seasonality and biology, linked to careful timing of insecticide applications to coincide with threshold levels of pests, can take full advantage of natural enemies and reduce insecticide input in the vegetable brassicas of cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower with no decrease in crop quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1991.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1982</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Picosecond Pulse Generation and Propagation in Erbium Doped Optical Fibres</field><field name="creator">Bollond, Paul</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the generation of picosecond pulses and their propagation through both resonant and non-resonant media. This was achieved by constructing a passively modelocked Erbium doped fibre laser (EDFL) which was used to study pulse propagation through sections of standard communications grade optical fibre, dispersion shifted optical fibre, and also through an Erbium doped fibre amplifier (EDFA) module. The EDFL produced a train of &#732;2 psec pulses at 4 MHz, tunable over the erbium gain band ( 1520 - 1570 nm). The laser was constructed from commercially available components and had the property of stability combined with low pump power requirements to produce &#732;50 Watt peak power pulses. The laser cavity geometry included a nonlinear optical loop mirror, which has the property of efficiently switching high peak power pulses, and allowed pulsed operation without the aid of any high-speed electronics. An EDFA module of identical geometry to that used in the laser was also constructed, and this was probed using the pulses from the EDFL. The traditional temporal and spectral measurements were found to be inadequate to allow a complete description of the pulse amplification process to be developed. To overcome this problem the technique of frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) was applied for the first time to optical fibre research, and allowed an indirect measurement of the electric field of the pulse. This complete description of the pulse was used in a numerical model to describe pulse propagation in an optical fibre. Fundamental propagation terms in the model were treated as free parameters in a minimisation scheme, which could be determined for a fibre under examination. This technique was shown to be accurate when used to examine pulse propagation through both standard and dispersion shifted optical fibre. A comprehensive numerical model was developed for the EDFA, and it was apparent from this model that a pulse propagating through an optimised EDFA encounters an atomic inversion distribution which is a strong function of distance along the amplifying fibre. It was also shown from the experimental results that the EDFA exhibited resonant dispersion, which is characteristic for propagation through an atomic medium on resonance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1983</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Approaches to the synthesis of anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Boniface, Peter James</field><field name="description">The Claisen rearrangement of 1,4-bis(prop-2'-enyloxy)anthraquinone under reducing conditions is investigated.

A.</field><field name="description">An experimental group (Group A) of 22 children around 7 years of age who had normal hearing for pure tones but who had experienced neonatal jaundice with peak bilirubin levels of at least 300 &#181;mol/l was tested on a range of audiological tests selected to assess aspects of their central auditory processing. Children who had not been tested for bilirubin level were selected as control subjects (Group B); they were matched on the variables gender, race, gestational age, birthweight, Apgar scores and occurrence of respiratory problems. A smaller experimental group, Group C (n=7), with peak bilirubin levels between 250 and 299 &#181;mol/l but with perinatal complications was also studied. The experimental groups had higher mean acoustic reflex thresholds and lower mean reflex amplitudes than the control group. Acoustic reflex threshold patterns of abnormality consistent with central dysfunction occurred in two children from the main experimental group and two children in the control group. None of the children from Group C showed abnormal reflex thresholds. Acoustic reflex amplitude patterns of abnormality consistent with central dysfunction were present in six children from Group A and two children from Group C, compared with three children from the control group. Masking level differences were absent in five subjects from Group A and three children from Group C, compared with three control subjects. No group differences were evident for ABR latency or amplitude measures, but poor morphology or repeatability of wave V was observed in ten subjects from Group A and three children from Group C, compared with five children from the control group. A larger number of failures within the experimental groups was found for two of the four speech tests, that is, for interrupted and filtered speech tests, but not speech in noise or competing words tests. Five children from Group A (but none from Group C) performed poorly on the interrupted speech test, compared with two from Group B. The filtered speech test was failed by six children from Group A and two children from Group C, compared with two from Group B. Parental reports of behavioural or learning disorders were distributed equally among the groups and were not associated with particular patterns of test failure. Overall, children in the experimental groups failed significantly more tests of central auditory functioning than did children in the control group (F(2,48)=5.5,p&lt;.01). The results were interpreted as implicating jaundice in long-term central auditory processing abnormalities.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1986</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis of Women&#8217;s Body Image: Comparisons Between Normal Weight, Overweight, Eating Disordered and Body Building Women</field><field name="creator">Hammond, Kay Maree</field><field name="description">This thesis approaches the area of women's body image with the aim of expanding existing knowledge based on traditional male/female comparisons of how women respond to quantitative measures of body image. It does so by distinguishing between some different body-type groups of women. These were mostly Caucasian women aged eighteen and over who lived in the greater Auckland area. They were grouped as: normal weight (n=43); overweight (n=37); women with eating disturbances (n=27); and body builders (n=17). A pilot study involving ten normal weight women examined the face validity of several established international measures of body image as well as additional ones developed for the main study. The established questionnaires were: the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale, the Body Esteem Scale, the Weight Locus of Control Scale, a Figure Rating Scale and a Silhouette Rating scale. The newer measures consisted of modifications made to the Figure Rating Scale and the Silhouette Rating scale. Verbal questions about teasing history were also asked, the intention being to formulate a teasing history questionnaire for the main study. These measures were found to be valid by the women. In part one of the main study quantitative comparisons between the groups revealed some differences, but also some surprising similarities. Desirable body types of normal weight and muscular physique were described positively in physical and personality terms. The undesirable body types of thin and overweight received negative descriptions irrespective of the women's own group membership. The eating disordered women scored the lowest self-esteem while the other groups did not differ. The body builders scored the highest body-esteem while the normal weight and overweight, and overweight and eating disordered groups did not differ. Correlations between self-esteem and body-esteem were significant for all groups except the body builders. The correlation was strong for the eating disordered group and moderate for the normal weight and overweight groups. In the Figure Rating Scale the body builders chose more muscular ideal figures than the other groups and for all groups the ideal and current figures were usually one figure size different. At least half the women in each group felt their body was the same size as they thought it was' Of those remaining who gave different answers to the think versus feel ratings, nearly all in the eating disordered group reported they felt bigger. In the other groups there was an even split between those who felt bigger and those who felt smaller than they thought they were. The women were most united in their selection of the figure they thought men would find most attractive. In approximately a quarter to one third of each group (excluding the body builders due to small numbers) the figure selected as attractive to men was also chosen as the self ideal. Approximately a quarter of each group [excluding body builders) selected the same self ideal and peer ideal, however a considerable percentage of women selected a larger self ideal than peer ideal. All groups reported there should not be an ideal figure at all in society. All groups tended to believe that their weight was under their own control. Most women reported having been teased about their appearance and being affected by this teasing. This was especially noticeable for the eating disordered group, a considerable percentage reporting they still felt adversely affected by it. Part two of the study introduces feminist poststructuralist theory and the Foucaultian concept of power and discourse analysis as ways to explore body image research. The body image literature introduced in part one is then revisited showing how this area of research can be harmful for women. The presentation of the interviews with 28 women follows, seven women from each body type group. A short form of discourse analysis was used for the women's responses to issues in body building, their explanations of the self-esteem, body-esteem, and the results of the correlation of the two. Issues related to the presence of an ideal figure size in society are also discussed. A longer form of discourse analysis was involved for the readings of the women's accounts of having been teased about their appearance. These readings showed many women located their accounts of teasing within a discourse of trivialisation-of-teasing, indicating that the seemingly trivial practice of teasing is a powerful form of social control, resulting in feelings of vulnerability. The study concluded with summaries and conclusions from the literature presented in the introductions of both parts one and two. The quantitative and qualitative research methods were compared to see what both could offer body image research. Finally speculations were made about directions which body image research could take at both the individual and cultural level.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of glycoprotein II from bovine adrenal medulla</field><field name="creator">Hieber, A. David (Andrew David), 1966-</field><field name="description">Glycoprotein II (GpII) is a glycoprotein isolated from the membranes of chromaffin granules in the adrenal medulla. The chromaffin granules of the adrenal medulla are responsible for the biosynthesis, storage and secretion of catecholamines, neuropeptides and various proteins. The abundance of chromaffin granules makes them an excellent model to further study the organelles specialized in the synthesis and secretion of hormones and neurotransmitters, from both endocrine and synaptic vesicles. When viewed by two-dimensional electrophoresis GpII is a heterogeneoug glycoprotein (80000-100000 daltons) consisting of two components, upper (GpIIa) and lower (GpIIb). Protein and immunological characterisation revealed that the two components of GpII are distinct from each other. Further molecular characterisation of GpIIa showed that it consisted of a 1224 base pair cDNA, encoding a 383 amino acid polypeptide, with a calculated molecular mass of 40500 daltons. This characterisation also revealed 19 potential glycosylation sites, with deglycosylation studies further demonstrating that an estimated 55% of the molecular mass of GpII is asparagine-linked carbohydrate. The presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine carbohydrate groups on GpII was also demonstrated. The predicted amino acid sequence of GpIIa shares a 72% amino acid identity with the human lamp-l type protein, which belongs to a highly conserved group of lysosomal associated membrane glycoproteins (lamp proteins). As the C-terminal region of GpIIa was identical to the C-terminal region of lamp proteins, a synthetic peptide to the C-terminal region of GpII was used to raise antisera to this region. This antisera was then used to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GpII wag present on chromaffin granules and facing the cytoplasm. This same C-terminal region on lamp proteins is known to be a cytoplasmic tail that is essential for the intracellular targeting of lamp proteins to the lysosome. A common feature to the pathways of both GpII and lamp proteins is their appearance on the cell surface followed by internalisation via endocytosis. As endocytosis of the chromaffin granule membrane is known to occur, the possibility that GpII was a marker for endocytosis was investigated. The presence of GpII within clathrin coated vesicles was shown, and evidence was presented to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of GpII interacts with adaptor proteins of clathrin coated vesicles. Adaptor proteins are known to mediate between the cytoplasmic domain of proteins internalised by endocytosis, and the outside coat of clathrin. The evidence presented would suggest that the cytoplasmic tail of GpII is a potential marker for endocytosis within the chromaffin granule membrane. The results presented in this study indicate that GpII is the secretory granule and species counterpart to the lamp proteins. This finding however raises some interesting questions regarding intracellular targeting between the lysosomes and secretory granules within the chromaffin cell.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1988</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of N-glycans of ovine and human luteinizing hormones</field><field name="creator">Hiyama, Jun</field><field name="description">Gonadotrophic hormones are heterodimeric glycoproteins and their N-glycans attached to specific amino acid residues are currently thought to play important roles in hormonal biosynthesis, secretion and function. The studies reported in this thesis aimed at isolation and characterisation of structural properties of the N-glycans on ovine and human luteinizing hormones. Initially, chromatographic methods were developed using reverse-phase HPLC for the analytical separation of the three human pituitary glycoprotein hormones and their subunits. Separation of intact oLH and its subunits was also effected by a single HPLC step. A preparative procedure was developed for the efficient purification of hLH and hTSH from crude human pituitary extracts using hydrophobic chromatography which gave highly purified hormones in good yields and with high biological activities. This method did not significantly influence the hormones' extensive charge heterogeneity and it offered potential advantages in the characterisation of their carbohydrate structures. A preparative scheme was developed for the isolation of the N-linked oligosaccharides from each glycosylation site of o- and hLH. Charge heterogeneity of oligosaccharides, which were released by hydrazinolysis from subunits and glycopeptides, was characterised by anion-exchange HPLC. 1H-NMR analysis showed that the structures of all three N-glycans on hLH were highly heterogeneous but mainly diantennary complex-type, with site-specific patterns of terminal sialylation and sulphation as well as core-fucosylation. Sulphated/sialylated and/or disialylated oligosaccharides were the major components at each site. A set of new mono- and disialylated oligosaccharides with the terminal sequence NeuAc&#945;2-6GalNAc&#946;1-4G1-cNAc&#946;1-2Man&#945;1-3 was identified. This finding suggested unique site-specific terminal sialylation of oligosaccharides at Asn 78 (hLH&#945;) by an unknown &#945;2-6 sialyltransferase(s) in the human pituitary gonadotroph cell. Each glycosylation site in oLH had a distinct set of oligosaccharides ranging from mainly monosulphated hybrid-type at the two sites of oLH&#945; to predominantly disulphated diantennary complex-type on oLH&#946;. Core-fucosylation also differed at each site. These results suggested that processing of the oligosaccharides of the &#945;- and &#946;-subunits by &#945;-mannosidase II and &#945;1-6 fucosyltransferase was differently regulated by protein structure in oLH. Whereas hCG, hLH and oLH share similar biological activities, no apparent relationship between their N-glycan structures was found, which suggested that specific branching and peripheral structures of N-glycans on LH and hCG may not be essential for biological function, although the N-glycan nearer the N-terminus of the &#945;-subunit of hCG has been implicated in hormonal activity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1989</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the quality of observers' records of behaviour</field><field name="creator">Mudford, Oliver Charles</field><field name="description">The measurement of behaviour by direct observation may be improved when observers have been provided with equipment which enables real-time recording. There are no data available concerning the quality of this type of measurement. Indeed, there is no consensus among researchers as to appropriate methods of quality assessment. In the present series of studies, observers were provided with hand-held computers programmed to act as real-time recorders. The quality of their records was assessed by three "traditional" methods, representative of those which have been used most frequently in previous behavioural research: interobserver agreement, observer/criterion agreement, and relative error. An instrument calibration procedure, the standard method for measurement accuracy analysis in the natural sciences and engineering, was demonstrated for comparison with traditional methods. The traditional methods were found to be unsatisfactory for theoretical and empirical reasons. The calibration procedure was shown to have some considerable potential advantages for applied behaviour analysis.

The acid catalysed rearrangement of abietic acid afforded two isomeric dienes the structures of which have been elucidated. Compounds containing the diene functionality were found to be unstable. However, removal of the diene system afforded stable compounds which are suited to further synthetic modification. Although the skeletal features possessed by a class of amber odorants were successfully introduced stereochemical control proved difficult. The stereochemistry of two intermediates was unambiguosly assigned by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The second chapter describes the successful conversion of totarol into conjugated dienolides possessing the B/C-ring present in type A and type C nagilactones. Consequently totarol may be considered as a useful model for the preparation of the biologically active nagilactones. In the course of this work several unusual rearrangements were observed. The products of rearrangement were characterised by 2-D n.m.r. and single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments and reaction mechanisms are proposed. The third chapter of this thesis reports the synthesis of the amber odorant, &#947;-bicyclohomofarnesal, from podocarpic acid. Analogues in which C-19 is functionalised were also prepared.

E.</field><field name="description">This thesis reviews the evolution of interim reporting in New Zealand. The attempts to regulate interim reporting by the stock Exchange Association of New Zealand and the lobbying behaviour of affected parties are documented. The regulation of interim reporting is interpreted as a series of self-interest actions by the affected parties. In 1973 semiannual reports were mandated for all firms listed on the New Zealand stock Exchange. However, the content of these reports, was not specified until 1976. The extent of voluntary reporting practice prior to 1973 is recorded. The major empirical analysis of the thesis examines the association between corporate characteristics and the voluntary disclosure of semiannual earnings during the period 1973 to 1976. The analysis shows that firms with high semiannual earnings disclosures have more shares issued, have paid an interim dividend, carry relatively less inventory, are in a more seasonal industry and have a greater earnings forecast error. Assets in place, political costs of disclosure and competitive costs of disclosure are not found to be associated with the level of semiannual earnings disclosure. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the significance of the explanatory variables depends on firm size and upon the threshold level of disclosure.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Accounting and Finance)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1992</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From Qing reformer to twentieth-century publisher: the life and times of Zhang Yuanji 1867 &#8211; 1959</field><field name="creator">Ip, Manying</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of Zhang Yuanji, both as a liberal patriotic reformer in late Qing and as China's leading publisher after 1900. A historical figure hardly known to the West, Zhang contributed substantially to China's modernization in his quiet pragmatic style. When China was challenged by the imperialist West, the response of the nation's scholar-gentry elite ranged from spirited calls for wholesale westernization to a stubborn clinging to the 'national essence'. Individuals at the extremes of this range have received more attention from historians than the middle-of-the-road group of moderates, who in the twentieth century worked for modernization without discarding tradition totally. Zhang Yuanji was a typical figure in this group who attained intellectual maturity under Confucianism and yet was open-minded enough to accept Western philosophies and to adopt Western practices of entrepreneurship. Zhang Yuanji's in tense sense of patriotic obligation to introduce progressive learning for China's benefit while popularizing the best of the classical heritage was coupled with a culturalistic viewpoint that there could be no genuine changes unless a certain percentage of China'S thinking population became modernized in outlook, well-informed of world affairs, and imbued with a progressive spirit. Zhang pioneered in modern education from 1896 and remained a dedicated educationalist all his life. His publishing career in the Commercial Press can be viewed as a logical extension of his early aim of modernizing China through the spread of new knowledge. The history of the Commercial Press and in particular Zhang's part in it have received little scholarly attention, previous treatments of the subject have relied heavily on two official Commercial Press histories and the autobiographical writings of Wang Yunwu, which neglect Zhang's major contributions. The Commercial Press, as the largest publishing house in modern China, was in the forefront of educational, scholarly, and literary development in China from 1900 to the 1950s, and Zhang played a vital role in promoting progressive publications as well as preserving the best editions of classics and histories. Zhang's efforts to run the Commercial Press successfully through all the political upheavals that beset China from late Qing to after 1949 reveal both the scholar's attempts to keep up with all the latest ideological trends as well as the entrepreneur's ambition to run a modern business efficiently. A study of Zhang Yuanji's life and career is in part a study of the evolution of China's gentry-elite and the emergence of the native capitalists. The thesis draws on newly-available primary materials, both in the original and in manuscript, including over a thousand of Zhang's letters, several hundred poems and essays, and the extant sections of his business diary. These materials are supplemented by information provided by Zhang's surviving literary and editorial colleagues. Internal publications and source-materials of the Commercial Press are also used to reconstruct this biography of a little-known man who worked for China's modernization by drawing on his solid learning about China's past.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--History)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The reading and language development of severely and profoundly deaf children in a total communication environment</field><field name="creator">Limbrick, Elizabeth Anne</field><field name="description">The purpose of this two year cross-sectional and longitudinal study was to examine the reading and language of severely and profoundly deaf children over two years. The focus was on reading and language achievement, measured by standardized tests and the process of reading demonstrated when engaged in reading prose. The children were the entire population of severely and profoundly deaf, aged from 5 to 10 years at the commencement of the study, who had no other educational handicaps. They were being educated within a Total Communication programme at the Kelston School for Deaf and associated unit classrooms. Reading achievement was assessed by the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Assessment Test on three occasions, each one year apart. Reading achievement was also assessed by documenting accuracy and comprehension (retelling) when reading natural language texts. Language achievement was measured using the Grammatical Analysis of Elicited Language (Moog and Geers, 1979, 1980). The relationship between reading and language achievement was established. The reading of natural language stories was analyzed to establish the pattern of errors (miscues) on text at two levels of difficulty for the reader. Categories of semantically appropriate, syntactically appropriate, grammatically similar, the omission of inflectional morphemes, fingerspelt miscues and signing errors were established. Comparisons were made between age groups, proficiency groups(High and Low) and across developmental levels. Cloze passages were also analysed to assess the use of contextual information by these readers. Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) were undertaken for each miscue category in the signed reading, classified by age and proficiency of the reader, and difficulty of the text. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were undertaken for the miscue categories classified by reading level, and the cloze exercise substitution classified by age and proficiency of the reader. Observations of classroom reading instructions were included to document the environment within which the children were being educated. Six individual case studies, three high progress and three low progress, were also analyzed. The findings suggest that reading achievement of these severely and profoundly deaf readers is still low. This is consistent with previous studies but achievement in comparison with earlier New Zealand data and data from surveys in the U.S. was slightly higher. This study supported previous research that suggested that standardized tests of reading do not adequately measure the reading achievement of deaf readers. High positive correlations (r &#8805;.90) between reading and language achievement were interpreted to be bi-directional and suggestive that higher rates of engaged time in reading could facilitate greater reading and language development. An integrated/interactive model most appropriately described the process of reading for these deaf readers as for hearing readers. Like hearing readers these deaf readers, at all ages and both high and low progress, were able to utilize contextual cues, and textual cues as they interacted with text. However, several unique differences in the process of reading have important implications for instruction. Low levels of syntactic cues during signed reading, it was suggested, reflect the readers use of their language in use and sensitivity to task factors. Fingerspelling was demonstrated to be a potentially useful strategy that was used at a significantly higher rate by High Progress readers. High Progress readers were more able than Low progress readers to use strategies ensuring fluency in order to construct meaning from texts Observations of classroom reading indicated that the rate of engaged time in reading was not high and that although the teachers espoused a meaning-emphasis some practices in the classroom did not foster independent problem solving readers. The educational implications of the data were discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">FTIR studies of surface adsorption on noble metal hydrosols</field><field name="creator">Mucalo, Michael Roger</field><field name="description">Carbon monoxide adsorption, surface speciation and particle size distributions have been studied in platinum, palladium, and rhodium hydrosol systems using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy. In transmission electron micrographs of unprotected platinum and palladium hydrosols, particle necklacing believed to arise from sintering during preparation, is apparent. The average particle sizes of all hydrosols studied were in the range of 2 to 12 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectra of the metal hydrosols revealed evidence for (Pt-O)ads, Pt(II) and Pt(IV) oxides on platinum hydrosol particles whereas Pd(II) and Pd(IV) oxides were detected on the surfaces of palladium hydrosol particles. These surface oxides are found to be important in influencing hydrosol surface processes such as CO adsorption as a function of pH, inhibition of CO adsorption by alcohols and surface corrosion products resulting from the addition of iodide and cyanide. Fourier transform infrared spectra of CO-treated metal hydrosols revealed bands due to CO linearly adsorbed on the metal particles at ca. 2070 cm-1 (Pt), 2067 cm-1 (Pd) and 2045 cm-1 (Rh) whereas bands due to bridge-adsorbed (B2) CO were detected at ca.1950 cm-1 (Pd) and 1890 cm-1 (Rh). The use of CO as a spectroscopic probe molecule enabled the study of changes in the surface properties of the metal hydrosols which were induced by changes in the dispersion medium. For example, v(CO)ads was observed to decrease in infrared spectra of CO-treated platinum and rhodium hydrosols as pH was increased by KOH or other dissolved salts yielding alkaline solutions. This suggested a reduction in CO coverage resulting from hydroxyl adsorption and consequent increased oxide growth on the particles. In contrast, CO adsorption on platinum and rhodium hydrosols was enhanced in acidic media possibly as a result of the neutralisation of surface hydroxyls. The spectroscopic behaviour of adsorbed CO on platinum and rhodium hydrosols was only comparable to that of CO adsorbed at an electrode surface in acidic media when protecting agent was present which prevented aggregation of the hydrosol in such media. Inhibition of CO adsorption on platinum hydrosols was induced by the addition of aliphatic alcohols, poly(vinyl alcohol) and poisoning anions such as CN- and SH-. Correlations of v(CO)ads with CO coverage suggested that island formation of adsorbed CO was occurring for CO adsorption on unprotected palladium hydrosols and protected platinum and rhodium hydrosols as a function of pH. In allied investigations, an infrared spectroelectrochemical study of corrosion of a nickel electrode in aqueous cyanide media has revealed that [Ni(CN)4]2- is detected at potentials more cathodic than 200 mV vs. SCE. Cyanide was oxidised to cyanate (OCN-) and then successively to carbon dioxide at potentials more anodic than 200 mV vs. SCE. The appearance of features at 2094 cm-1 (HCN) and 2256 cm-1 (HNCO) were attributed to pH changes associated with the oxidation of cyanide to cyanate. The appearance of a band at ca. 2218 cm-1 in infrared spectra of the thin layer at very high potentials (&gt; 1000 mV vs. SCE) was believed to arise from an unstable nickel(II) isocyanate complex.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1991.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancements to an object-oriented programming language</field><field name="creator">Mugridge, Warwick Bruce</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis has been to explore the value and limitations of Class, an object-oriented programming language, in order to further the development of the language. The pivot for this thesis is WallBrace, a code-checking system. The development of the WallBrace system is the basis of a critique of Class, and leads to a number of language extensions being proposed. An important aim in this work has been the careful integration of these enhancements with the rest of the language, avoiding unnecessary additions. A number of functional and object-oriented extensions to the language are proposed. Discrimination functions, which may be higher-order and polymorphic, add considerable functional power. Generic classes allow for abstract data types, such as sets and lists, to be defined within the language. The forms interface proposed will greatly enhance the quality of user interfaces to Class programs. An external interface will allow Class programs to communicate with files, databases, and specialist user-interface programs, such as for plan entry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Computer Science)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1997</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Young people's reactions to nuclear issues : a constructivist analysis</field><field name="creator">Oliver, Pam, 1949-</field><field name="description">The 1980s saw an increasing interest amongst psychologists, both as researchers and as practitioners, in the ways in which people react to nuclear weapons issues, especially the perceived threat of nuclear war. Much of the research in relation to "nuclear threat", undertaken either within the United States or by United States psychiatrists in collaboration with European colleagues, and using extensive questionnaire surveys, focused on the fears of children and teenagers. Some researchers concluded that large proportions of young people were at risk of impaired psychological development because of nuclear threat which resulted in a pervasive sense of futurelessness and a distrust of .adults. This research has been widely criticised since because of apparent researcher bias in the methods used, interpretations offered, and general paradigm. I also found much of the research ethically objectionable. My research has involved 52 interviews with young New Zealanders and administration of a questionnaire to more than 2000 others, including ages nine to 18 and three ethnocultural groups, as well as interviews with some teachers. The objectives of these studies were: (1) to produce detailed information about how young New Zealanders react to nuclear weapons issues which might be used by educationalists, mental health professionals, parents, and young people themselves in dealing with those issues; (2) to make specific recommendations about young New Zealanders' apparent needs and preferences for learning about and dealing with nuclear weapons and related issues; (3) to provide a detailed methodological comparison of interview and questionnaire approaches to this research topic, and discuss issues of theory and paradigm; and (4) to comment on ethical and practical issues for both the researcher and the researched in undertaking research on emotive and potentially distressing topics, especially with young people. As a result Chapter 1 of my thesis contains a comprehensive critical review of the international research and theory relating to young people's perceptions of nuclear weapons, examining the problems of method, interpretation and paradigm associated with this area of research. Both interview and survey data are presented in relation to: (a) young people's levels of awareness and sources of information about nuclear issues; (b) their emotional, cognitive and behavioural reactions to nuclear issues, including coping strategies and activism: (c) their perceptions of the future; (d) comparisons across gender, age and ethnocultural group; (e) the role of adults; and (f) differences between New Zealanders and other national groups. The data are discussed in terms of: (i) their patterns, contexts and meanings; (ii) their implications for peace and global issues education; and (iii) their implications for research method, including ethical issues. Recommendations are made for how psychologists and others can help young people and adults in dealing with global and social threats, including how to undertake research which is empowering as well as valid and useful.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/1998</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Panbiogeography: a cladistic approach</field><field name="creator">Page, Roderic D.M.

Using evidence obtained from contemporary violoncello methods, periodical reviews, iconographic materials, diaries, letters, musical manuscripts, first-edition performance repertoire, and first-hand research at the Library of Congress, Smithsonian Institute and University of California at Berkeley, the technical methodology of each school is examined. By this process, diverse qualities in the playing manner of J. P. Duport, J. L. Duport, Janson, Tricklir, Breval, J. H. Levasseur, Lamare, Hus-Desforges, Baudiot, Norblin, Vaslin and Franchomme, and that of A. Kraft, Ritter, Romberg, N. Kraft, Dotzauer, Lincke, Bohrer, Merk and Kummer are discernible.    Such divergences in bowing technique form the basis of dissimilarities present in French and Austro-German violoncello performance of 1785-1839, a circumstance occasioned by a variety of contributing factors. These issues are segregated for investigation. Following the Introduction, Chapters 1 and 2 provide background information regarding the development of the instrument, bow, and bowing techniques before 1785. Chapter 3 discusses design modifications that occurred to the instrument and bow between 1785 and 1839. Chapters 4 and 5 present the biographies of each of the violoncellists examined, while Chapter 6 discusses the influence of performers from the French violin school and the musician interaction brought about by the French Revolution and subsequent wars.    Analysis of the varying performance characteristics of the French and Austro-German schools begins with Chapter 7, this chapter and Chapter 8 surveying the performance methodology of each of the violoncellists included in this study. Chapters 9 and 10 assess the consequential relationship of performance technique to performance repertoire and Chapter 11 summarizes the findings of the accomplished research.    These findings detail differences in the performance methodology of the French, Austrian and German violoncello schools in the period 1785-1839. The variants evinced include the manner in which the bow and instrument were held, the type of bowing techniques incorporated into the performance repertoire of each nationality and the method of their execution, the way in which the violoncello's varying sonorities were exploited, and the regard for sound quality and volume by performers of each school.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">MUSIC (0413)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, MUSIC (0522)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, EUROPEAN (0335)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Music)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/20</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth, development and visual ontogeny of two temperate reef teleosts Pagrus auratus, (Sparidae) and Forsterygion varium, (Tripterygiidae)</field><field name="creator">Pankhurst, Patricia Melva</field><field name="description">Growth, development and behaviour were examined in artificially reared larval Pagrus auratus and Forsterygion varium, from the time of hatching. Yolk-sac larval P.auratus hatched at a small size (2.00mm SL), without functional eyes, mouth or digestive tract, and for three days spent long periods at rest. Growth was initially rapid but slowed by 3 days as yolk reserves neared depletion. By days 4-5, the mouth had opened, eyes were functional, yolk was depleted, and a rudimentary gut had formed. Larvae were now able to maintain a horizontal swimming mode and were actively searching for and attacking prey. First feeding was observed in some larvae. Growth was retarded during the transition from endogenous to exogenous nutrition and then increased as feeding proficiency improved. Yolk-sac F.varium hatched at a larger size (4.78mm SL), with functional eyes and jaws. Larvae were able to maintain a horizontal swimming mode from hatching. First feeding was observed from the first day after hatching. F.varium larvae grew steadily from the time of hatching. Ocular morphology was examined in larval, juvenile and adult P.auratus and F.varium. There was a 96 fold increase in eye size, from 0.23mm diameter in a 4 day old larval P.auratus (3.4mm SL) to a maximum diameter of 22mm in an adult of 333mm body length. F.varium displayed a 26 fold increase in eye size, from 0.28mm diameter in the smallest larva (5.00mm SL) to a maximum eye diameter of 7.2mm in a 11gmm long adult. Larval fish had pure cone retinae, however putative rod precursor cells were present from hatching in F.varium and from 18 days in P.auratus. Juvenile and adult fish had duplex retinae with cones arranged in a square mosaic in which 4 twin cones surround a central single cone. Hypertrophy of cone ellipsoids with increasing eye size, resulted in maintenance of a closely packed array in fishes of all sizes. The appearance of retinomotor movements was coincident with the development of a duplex retina in both species. Theoretical spatial acuity (calculated as a function of cone spacing and focal length of the lens) was poor in the smallest larval fish (2&#176; 1' and 1&#176; 8' minimum separable angle in 4 and 1 day old P.auratus and F.varium respectively) but improved to asymptotic values in adults (3'- 4', and 9' in P.auratus and F.varium respectively). Behavioural acuity (determined using the optokinetic response) of 4 day old larval P.auratus (37&#176; 30') and 1 day old F.varium (29&#176;) was very much lower than histological estimates. Behavioural acuity improved to 8&#176; 8' in 16 day old P.auratus and 4&#176; 18' in 14 day old F.varium, but did not attain theoretical estimates for fish of that size (55' and 54'). A rudimentary retractor lentis muscle was first apparent in larval fish 1 week after hatching, and was coincident with the formation of a posterior lental space. Presumably larval fish eyes were incapable of accomodative lens movements until this time. A relative measure of Matthiessen's ratio (distance from lens centre to boundary of the pigmented retinal epithelium/lens radius) measured histologically, decreased from 4.2 and 2.7 in 3 day old P.auratus and newly hatched F.varium, to 2.2 and 2.3 in larvae 22 and 16 days of age respectively. This suggests that growth of the retina and lens were not symmetrical in the eyes of very small larval fish. If Matthiessen's ratio holds for little eyes, then they will initially be strongly myopic. This may account in part for the mismatch between behavioural and theoretical acuity. Perceptive distances of first feeding larval P.auratus and F.varium, estimated for prey items equal in dimensions to maximum jaw widths, were very small (0.2mm and 0.4mm for prey 0.15mm and 0.2mm in size respectively), but increased with increasing body size to 2.1mm and 4.0mm for prey 0.3mm in size, at 16 and 14 days of age respectively. These data have implications for larval feeding in the wild.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1991.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2000</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular studies on actinidin, a cysteine protease from kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Podivinsky, Ellen</field><field name="description">Research in this thesis describes the characterisation of mRNA sequences coding for actinidin, a cysteine protease found in abundance in the fruit of kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa). The first step in the characterisation required the isolation of mRNA from ripe kiwifruit tissue. The suitability of a number of RNA extraction procedures was investigated. The method finally adopted differed from that used for unripe fruit tissue, and was chosen as a result of the nature of the polysaccharide that contaminated nucleic acids prepared from extracts of kiwifruit fruit tissue. RNA extracted from ripe fruit was used to synthesis a partial cDNA library and clones for actinidin were isolated. A number of these cDNA clones were sequenced; three clones were almost full-length. The actinidin cDNA clones obtained fall into two broad sequence classes. The majority of them encode acidic proteins (pI&#732;4.7), with 97% homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin. The second class encode basic proteins (pI&#732;8.1), with 83% homology to the published amino acid sequence of actinidin. Both classes of actinidin cDNA sequence encode zymogens, which contain N- and C-terminal extensions not present in the mature form of the enzyme. The N-terminal extension of both sequence classes includes a putative signal peptide. Northern hybridization analysis was used to investigate the tissue specificity of actinidin mRNA expression, and the expression of mRNA for the two actinidin sequence classes during fruit ripening. Both actinidin sequence classes were expressed differentially during the latter stages of kiwifruit fruit development and through post-harvest fruit ripening. The expression of both sequence classes increased from just prior to fruit maturity through ripening and reached a maximum as fruit attained the stage of 'eating' ripeness. The level of expression of the sequences encoding acidic actinidin reached a plateau at this point, while the expression of the sequence encoding basic actinidin appeared to decrease slightly as fruit continued to ripen. The sequences encoding acidic actinidin were expressed during ripening at a much higher level than those encoding basic actinidin. No actinidin mRNA was detected in other tissues except for very low levels of the acidic form in kiwifruit leaf, and low levels of the basic form in senescing petals. A full-length, acidic, actinidin cDNA sequence was introduced into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Using the binary vector pGA643, the sequence was introduced in both the sense and antisense orientation relative to the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and transgenic plants were obtained for both sequence orientations. The presence of the T-DNA cassette (containing the actinidin sequence) in the plant genomes was determined using PCR analysis, and confirmed by Southern hybridization. A number of the transgenic plants contained multiple insertions of the actinidin sequence, and most plants contained at least one intact copy of the T-DNA cassette. The transcription of the introduced actinidin sequence was investigated by Northern hybridization analysis. All of the plants containing actinidin in the sense orientation, and some of those incorporating the antisense construct, transcribed the actinidin sequence. Attempts to detect actinidin protein in the transgenic plants were unsuccessful. Acidic actinidin was identified as one of the most abundant bands in the total protein profile from ripe kiwifruit fruit tissue. The identity of the protein was confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. The electrophoretic mobility of actinidin, both in the total cell homogenate and when partially purified, suggested that the first step in post-translational processing of the zymogen may be the removal of the N-terminal extension. Actinidin was also partially purified and used to raise antibodies. Poor specificity of the antibody for actinidin led to preliminary evidence for the glycosylation of actinidin.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cellular and Molecular Biology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2001</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the relationships between housing patterns, social class and political attitudes in three Auckland electorates</field><field name="creator">Prince, John D. (John David)</field><field name="description">There is a strain of social criticism, dating back to the fifties and sixties, which alleged that New Zealand was about to become a society more clearly divided by lines related to "class". New Zealand was presented as a society in which a natural egalitarianism of social habits and attitudes had flourished. The critical voices of this earlier period feared that as New Zealand's economy evolved further, so would the degree of social demarcation within society. They expected that these changes would show up most rapidly, and with deeper effects, in the northernmost part of New Zealand, particularly in Auckland. There the postwar period's industrial development and population growth was greatest. In the suburbs of the north, middle class beliefs and life styles would develop. Suburban life, in areas of new housing containing those who most notably benefited from these changes, would provide mutual reinforcements for the evolution of a much more consciously middle class way of life. Many of the implications of this social criticism are explored in this thesis by means of a questionnaire professionally administered to a sample of 312 respondents in three Auckland electorates. East Coast Bays was chosen as an example of a burgeoning middle class suburb, Te Atatu as a newer area of working class settlement, and Birkenhead as a bridge between the two of them, socially and politically. The survey was administered shortly before the 1978 general election. A variety of facts about, and attitudes to, housing, employment, life styles, suburban locations and indistrialisation are explored. These are normally related back to the basic dependent variables of voting choice, electorate, the propensity to think in class terms, and subjective class identification. The overwhelming pressure of the evidence is that of continuity with the egalitarian past. The chief hypothesis tested is that "following on the most rapid processes of postwar industrialisation in New Zealand, new suburban contexts have evolved in Auckland in which the middle class beneficiaries of Auckland's growth are reinforced in attitudes that reject egalitarianism, accept differential rewards and life styles, and are associated with distinctive political and social attitudes". On the evidence presented in this study it must be rejected.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political studies)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and application of a modelling system for supporting managerial decision making</field><field name="creator">Cowie, Grant Crawford</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the potential role of formal models in providing support to the strategic-level decision processes within an organisation. Strategic activities are defined as being essentially outward looking and primarily concerned with the positioning of the organisation in its environment in the long term. The types of interaction which are of interest at this level are defined and a general mathematical framework is developed to describe these processes. Optimisation techniques which are potentially useful in the screening and evaluation of decision alternatives are also discussed. A collection of mathematical techniques will, however, remain only of theoretical interest. To be of practical assistance in the decision-making process they must be accessible to the decision maker. This can only be accomplished by means of a properly constructed computer system. A brief review of decision support systems, the field of study which is concerned with the application of computers to the decision making process, is followed by an investigation into the requirements that a computer system should fulfil if it is to be successful as a strategic-level decision aid. An overview is then given of "Stratagem", a computer system designed and built to integrate the mathematical modelling framework and the decision support concepts. Finally, two different applications of Stratagem are described to illustrate its potential role in strategic-level decision processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Management Studies)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Coherent transient phenomena in the mode-locked argon laser</field><field name="creator">Dudley, John Michael</field><field name="description">An investigation has been carried out into the operation of a mode-locked argon laser at a wavelength of 514.5 nm and a repetition rate of 76.8 MHz. The characteristics of the pulses from the laser have been found to depend on the intra-cavity power level in the laser, and at average intra-cavity power levels exceeding 4 W, the pulses from the laser have a duration of typically 35 psec accompanied by a characteristic double-peaked spectrum with a spectral width of 13 GHz These pulse durations are approximately three times shorter than expected based on the inhomogeneously broadened transition bandwidth of 4 GHz. The dependence of the pulse characteristics on the intra-cavity power level has been explained by a model of pulse propagation where the coherent coupling between the pulse and the atomic polarisation in the laser gain medium is included. Detailed examination of the pulse structure reveals the presence of afterpulses that have a typical intensity two orders of magnitude lower than the main pulse. These afterpulses are interpreted as ringing arising from coherent Rabi-type oscillation of the atomic polarisation associated with the circulating pulse in the laser. Numerical simulations of the mode-locked laser have also been developed based on the fully coherent Maxwell-Bloch equations, and the results from the simulations reproduce well the experimentally observed variation in pulse characteristics. Based on results from the simulations, the short pulses observed at high intra-cavity powers are interpreted as the superfluorescent &#960; &#8211;pulse solutions predicted in the long distant limit of pulse propagation in a swept-gain amplifying medium. The laser operation has also been studied in a mode-locked cavity dumped configuration. In this case the combination of the coherent mode-locking processes described above with the cavity dumped operation at a repetition rate of 3.8 MHz results in the observation of stable pulses with peak power of 1.6 kW.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2005</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetric syntheses of anthraquinonyl C-glycosides</field><field name="creator">Bercich, Mark David</field><field name="description">Syntheses of C2-anthraquinone aldehydes from the commercially available anthrarufin 11 have been investigated. A synthesis of the ketoaldehyde 5 in nine steps and 73% overall yield was achieved. Syntheses of 5 exploiting selective oxidations of either a C-bound allyl group via Wacker oxidation to introduce the methyl ketone functionality, or of a C-bound prop-l-enyl moiety via dihydroxylation and oxidative cleavage to generate the C2 formyl group were also developed. The aldehyde 81 was synthesised in seven steps and 81% overall yield from ll, and syntheses of the phenolic aldehydes 82, 95, and 96, the Cl benzyloxyaldehyde 104, and the anthracene aldehyde 107 have been developed. Hetero Diels-Alder reactions of several anthraquinone aldehydes with the dienes 6,120, and 121 using catalysis by the complex (+)-VO(hfc)2 115 were studied. Reactions of the aldehydes 5 and 81 proceeded readily using catalytic amounts of 115 and dichloromethane, chloroform, or toluene as solvent to give the adducts 128 or 131 indicating an endo selective pericyclic reaction pathway. The enantioselectivites of these reactions were typically 20-50%, with a best ee of 56% for a reaction between 81 and 6 catalysed by 0.2 equivalents of 115 at -78&#176;C. Reactions of the 1-silyloxydienes 120 and 121 with aldehyde 8l catalysed by 115 to give the enone 130 also proceeded readily with a best ee of 64% being obtained for a reaction between 81 and l2l in toluene at -78&#176;C. Reactions of the phenolic aldehydes 95 and 96 and the diene 6, catalysed by 115, afforded good yields of cycloadducts, but with enantioselectivities identical to equivalent reactions of the aldehyde 81. However reactions of the Cl benzyloxyaldehyde 104 with the dienes 6 and 120, and 121 afforded cycloadducts with enantioselectivities lower than those from the equivalent reactions of the aldehyde 81. Elaboration of the cycloadduct 131 to the anthracene C-glycoside 149 established that the hetero Diels-Alder reaction had favoured the formation of the 2'R, 6'R enantiomer of 131. This enantiofacial selectivity was correlated with the sense of anisochrony observed in 1H NMR spectra of the ketone 129, derived from 131, in the presence of the chiral solvating agent (S)(+)-trifluoroanthrylethanol. The enone 130 was elaborated to the anthraquinone-olivose C-glycoside 154 demonstrating the utility of hetero Diels-Alder reactions involving silyloxydienes with Cl silyloxy and Cl methyl substituents for such syntheses. Attempts to use chiral acyloxyborane comploxes such as 168 and 169 as catalysts for hetero Diels-Alder reactions of the aldehydes 5, 81 and 107 with the dienes 6 and 120 were unsuccessful. However two equivalents of the chiral acyloxyborane complex 168a in dichloromethane at 30&#176;C, mediated. a formal hetero Diels-Alder reaction between 81 and 120 affording the enone 13O in 45% yield, with a 79% ee in favour of the 6'R enantiomer. Reactions catalysed by the chiral acyloxyborane complex 169b between beenzaldehyde or o-anisaldehyde and the dienes 6,119, and 120 gave products resulting from a Mukaiyama aldol addition rather than a hetero Diels-Alder reaction. Hetero Diels-Alder reactions 81 and 120 employing the chiral titanium complexes Ti[(R)-BINOL]C12, Ti[(R)-BINOL]2, and Ti[R,R)-TADDOL]C12 were investigated. No reaction was observed when 0.5, 1.2 and 2 equivalents of Ti[(R)-BINOL]2 were used. However the complexes Ti[(R)-BINOL]C12 and Ti[(R,R)-TADDOL]C12 promoted the reaction between 81 and 120 at -30&#176;C and -78&#176;C, but induced low enantioselectivities (17-30%)</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2007</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Annulations of diterpenoids via organomanganese and organoiron complexes</field><field name="creator">Metzler, Michael Reinhold</field><field name="description">Chapter One of this Thesis reports an investigation of the synthesis of diterpenoids (as potential ligands for cyclomanganation reactions) from podocarpic acid, and one from dehydroabietic acid. A number of monocyclic aromatic and chalcone derivatives were synthesised to act as model compounds in the subsequent complexation reactions. The second chapter describes successful complexations of the above ligands containing aldehyde, ketone, ester, or oxime groups as directing functionalities to form the resulting tetracarbonylmanganese sigma adducts in moderate to excellent yield. Attempted complexation of amide-containing ligands proved generally to be unsuccessful. Complexation of ligands containing either two potential sites for manganation or two potential ligating groups were investigated and the structures of the isolated complexes established unequivocally by N.M.R. spectroscopy or by X-ray crystallography. Chapter Three describes the successful coupling reactions of the tetracarbonylmanganese complexes with ethene and with substituted electron-poor olefins to give pentaannulated derivatives of podocarpic acid in very good yields. The stereochemistry of two cyclised alcohols was assigned unambiguously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. Various methods of activating the tetracarbonyl complexes were investigated, including chemical oxidation, and palladium(II)-mediated or thermally-promoted reactions. Two of the pentaannulated adducts were converted successfully into benzannulated analogues in good yield. Analogous coupling reactions of the activated complexes with ethyne and substituted alkynes are discussed in Chapter Four. Chapter Five reports an investigation of the reactions of the tetracarbonylmanganese complexes with halogen electrophiles such as Br2, ICl, or ICl3. When these reactions were performed in non-protic solvents the corresponding aryl halides were isolated in moderate to excellent yield. However, in protic solvents carbonyl insertion occurred to afford &#947;-lactones in very good yield. The stereochemistry of one of these lactones was assigned unambiguously by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment. Oxidative cleavage of the C-Mn bond with a number of reagents proved generally to be unsuccessful, the isolation of oxygenated diterpenoids being observed only from reaction with Pb(OAc)4. Chapter Six describes various attempts at functionalising ring C of podocarpic acid derivatives via alternative methods to cyclomanganation. These include an investigation into the formation of &#951;4-dienol ether and &#951;4-diene tricarbonyliron complexes derived from the Birch reduction products of podocarpic acid derivatives; attempted regioselective chlorination and mercuration studies of ring C arenes; functionalisation of chlorinated podocarpic acid derivatives via their tricarbonylchromium complexes; and attempted oxidation of ring C arenes with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2009</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Translation of New Zealand fiction into film</field><field name="creator">McDonnell, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the topic of literature-into-film adaptation by investigating the use of New Zealand fiction by film-makers in this country. It attempts this task primarily by examining eight case-studies of the adaptation process: five features designed for cinema release (Sleeping Dogs, A State of Siege, Sons for the Return Home, The Scarecrow and Other Halves), one feature-length television drama (the God Boy), and two thirty-minute television dramas (The Woman at the Store and Big Brother, Little Sister, from the series Winners and Losers). All eight had their first screenings in the ten-year period 1975-1985. For each of the case-studies, the following aspects are investigated: the original work of fiction, a practical history of the adaptation process (including interviews with people involved), and a study of changes made during the scripting and shooting stages. The films are analysed in detail, with a focus on visual and auditory style, in particular how these handle the themes, characterisation and style of the original works. Comparisons are made of the structures of the novels and the films. For each film, an especially close reading is offered of sample scenes (frequently the opening and closing scenes). The thesis is illustrated with still photographs &#8211; in effect, quotations from key moments &#8211; and these provide a focus to aspects of the discussion. Where individual adaptation problems existed in particular case-studies (for example, the challenge of the first-person narration of The God Boy), these are examined in detail. The interaction of both novels and films with the society around them is given emphasis, and the films are placed in their cultural and economic context - and in the context of general film history. For each film, the complex reception they gained from different groups (for example, reviewers, ethnic groups, gender groups, the authors of the original works) is discussed. All the aspects outlined above demonstrate the complexity of the responses made by New Zealand film-makers to the pressure and challenges of adaptation. They indicate the different answers they gave to the questions raised by the adaptation process in a new national cinema, and reveal their individual achievements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1986.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Out of mind, out of sight: unilateral spatial disorders in brain-damaged patients</field><field name="creator">Ogden, Jennifer Ann</field><field name="description">Hemineglect and unilateral extinction on double simultaneous stimulation in humans are neuropsychological disorders which sometimes follow a lesion to the cortex, subcortex or basal ganglia of one cerebral hemisphere. The main symptom is that the patient appears to neglect or be unaware of stimuli which impinge in one half of space relative to the patient's body. The side of space neglected is usually the side contralateral to the brain lesion. This thesis comprises a collection of studies on various aspects of these disorders. Experimental subjects were patients in the Neurology and Neurosurgical Wards of Auckland Hospital. All had clearly defined solitary unilateral brain lesions confirmed by Computerized Tomography. Chapter 1 provides a historical review of research in the area, defines concepts, reviews recent human and animal research on hemineglect and extinction, and outlines the different theories which have been proposed in order to explain hemineglect. Chapter 2 describes the methods used in neuropsychological testing, the criteria used in the selection of subjects, the etiologies of the different types of lesions sustained by the patient sample, and the neuropsychological tests used in the various studies. Chapter 3 is a study of the incidence and severity of visual hemineglect in a group of 56 patients with left-hemispheric lesions and 45 patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Five paper and pencil tests designed to measure the presence and severity of visual hemineglect were given to these patients. The incidence of hemineglect in the two groups did not differ significantly (50% and 44% in the left and right brain-damaged groups respectively). However, visual hemineglect was found to be more severe after right- than after left-hemispheric lesions. The two groups were found to differ significantly with respect to the loci of lesions most likely to result in hemineglect. In the right brain-damaged group most patients with hemineglect had posterior lesions, and in the left brain-damaged group most patients with hemineglect had anterior lesions. Possible reasons for this are discussed in terms of the effects the lateralization of language representation might have on the representation of spatial functions. Chapter 4 describes an experiment designed to determine whether patients with unilateral cerebral lesions neglect the contralesional sides of their mental images of the external world. This phenomenon has previously been observed for patients with left-sided visual neglect following right-hemispheric lesions. Twenty control subjects and 16 patients with right- and left-hemispheric lesions were involved in the experiment reported in this chapter. In the 'static' condition they viewed pairs of complex shapes displayed, one shape at a time, on a video-screen controlled by a computer. In the 'dynamic' condition the pairs of shapes apparently moved, one at a time, behind a narrow vertical slit. In both conditions the subject had to decide whether the two shapes of each pair were the same or different. In fact, some were the same, while some differed on the right and others on the left. In the 'dynamic' condition subjects had to construct spatial images from non-spatial external stimuli before they could make a same/different response. Both right and left brain-damaged groups demonstrated a significant neglect of the contralesional sides of their images of the shapes in that they often gave 'same' responses when the shapes actually differed on their contralesional sides. This had implications for normal imagery processes. It appears that at some advanced stage our images are mapped onto our hemispheres in an analogue fashion. That is, objects or parts of objects that we imagine to be on our left are mapped onto our right hemispheres, and those parts we imagine to be on our right are mapped onto our left hemispheres. If one hemisphere is damaged at a site which is essential to this imagery process, the contralateral half of the external stimulus that is being imagined will be degraded or neglected. Chapter 5 is a study of auditory extinction in unilaterally brain-damaged patients. In particular the phenomenon of ipsilateral auditory extinction is investigated in detail. Previous researchers have found ipsilateral auditory extinction for dichotically presented verbal stimuli following lesions only of the posterior left hemisphere. It has been hypothesized that a lesion in this area disconnects a posteriorly routed interhemispheric auditory pathway and that as a consequence, left-ear verbal input is unable to reach the left (speech) hemisphere. In Experiment 1, I tested 53 brain-damaged patients for extinction of digits on a dichotic listening task and found that patients with lesions wholly anterior to the central sulcus in the left hemisphere exhibited ipsilateral extinction as well as patients with posterior left-hemispheric lesions. This finding poses problems for the above hypothesis that relies on a posterior inter-hemispheric pathway, and alternatives to this hypothesis are discussed. In Experiment 2, I tested 16 patients for extinction of dichotically presented non-verbal material (tones) to ascertain whether ipsilateral extinction is restricted to verbal tasks. Ipsilateral extinction was not found on this task for either left or right brain-damaged patients. This suggested not only that ipsilateral auditory extinction is related to the disconnection or disruption of left-ear verbal input from the left (speech) hemisphere, but that the right hemisphere is not essential for the decoding and processing of non-verbal material. That is, I did not find right-ear ipsilateral extinction for non-verbal input in patients with right-hemispheric lesions. Chapter 6 is the study of multimodal hemineglect and extinction in patients with right- and left-hemispheric lesions. Clinical observations suggest that multimodal neglect may be a single disorder with a common underlying cause, and that the number of modalities affected is dependent upon the severity of the underlying deficit. For example, patients with hemiasomatagnosia (body hemineglect) are often observed to exhibit visual hemineglect and tactile extinction as well. I tested 50 patients for contralesional visual hemineglect, auditory extinction, tactile extinction and hemiasomatagnosia and computed phi correlation coefficients for pairs of disorders to see if there was any basis for supposing they were caused by the same underlying deficit. As the proportion of patients with hemineglect varied widely from modality to modality, possibly as a result of varying sensitivities of the tests used to measure the different forms of neglect, I also computed tetrachoric correlation coefficients. This measure corrects for varying proportions on the assumption that a normal distribution underlies each dichotomy. The results were inconclusive as the phi-coefficients were generally low and the tetrachoric coefficients very high. Because of the extreme difference between the two forms of correlation it was not possible to come to any conclusions about the 'true' correlations. It may be that at least some forms of hemineglect and extinction are independent of one another and are often found together in the same patients because the lesions overlap modality-specific areas, rather than because they result from the same underlying cause. Chapters 7 summarizes the studies described in Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the results are reviewed in the light of some of the more important theories of hemineglect.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320700 Neurosciences::320799 Neurosciences not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development, ultrastructure and biomechanics of the swimbladder of the New Zealand snapper, Pagrus auratus</field><field name="creator">Ling, Nicholas</field><field name="description">The eggs and larvae of the New Zealand snapper Pagrus auratus are pelagic with early buoyancy provided by dilute body fluids. The swimbladder begins to develop on the third day after hatch from a dorsal evagination of the gut tube. Communication w1h the gut is lost on about the tenth day following pneumatic inflation at around day eight. At this age the gas gland system appears fully functional and capable of secreting gas. By the age of settlement at around 30 days the swimbladder is a fully functional replica of the adult form except for the lack of a resorbent capillary system which does not develop until later in juvenile life. The swimbladder of the adult is of the euphysoclist form with a dorsally located resorbent oval area and sits high in the pleural cavity. The ventral tunica externa is firmly attached to the connective tissue lining the pleural space. The adult swimbladder displaces 5.6% of the volume of the body and its volume is regulated to provide near neutral buoyancy. The connective tissue integument provides almost no restriction to volume changes brought about by vertical movements of the fish and the swimbladder obeys Boyle's Law for physiological pressure changes. The ability of the connective tissue of the tunica externa to accommodate large tissue strains is due to massive regular crimping of otherwise straight collagen fibrils allowing reversible extensions up to 130%. In all other respects however the tissue structure of the tunica externa is consistent with a tissue providing an active mechanical role. The fibrillar morphology and physicochemical properties of swimbladder collagen is consistent with the vertebrate type I form however there are interesting variations in collagen form distributed throughout the swimbladder. Fibrillar morphology of the highly extensible tunica interna is significantly different to that of the tunica externa and appears to play very little mechanical rote. The extensibilty of the tunica externa appears to be regulated by physiological stress and related to the past history of tissue strain.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance in multiple schedules</field><field name="creator">Charman, Lesle Frances</field><field name="description">Four experiments are reported. Each experiment investigated a different variable which at sometime has been thought to influence performance in multiple schedules. Variable-interval schedules were used in all experiments and twelve pigeons served as subjects, six in the first two experiments and six in the third and fourth. The parametric data provided by each experiment were analysed using the generalized matching law and comparisons with findings in concurrent-schedule research were made. In Experiment 1 the effects of component durations and component reinforcer rates on multiple-schedule performance were investigated. Component duration did not affect sensitivity to the ratios of reinforcer rates. In Experiment 2 the effects of food deprivation and component reinforcer rates on multiple-schedule performance were investigated. Sensitivity to the ratios of reinforcer rates increased as deprivation was reduced. However, the data could only be explained by a model which assumed no direct component interaction. In Experiment 3 the discriminability of the stimuli customarily used in multiple-schedule research was investigated. The stimuli were perfectly discriminable. It was shown that the undermatching of response and reinforcer ratios typical of multiple-schedule performance was not the result of a failure to discriminate the stimuli signalling the components. In Experiment 4, a procedure for investigating time allocation in multiple schedules was introduced. The birds could switch in to the component in effect, and the components alternated at three minute intervals. Each switch in to a component gave acess to the schedule in effect for fixed brief periods. Ratios of component response rates showed typical multiple-schedule undermatching. However, a commonality in concurrent and multiple-schedule performance was revealed in respect to local or switched-in response rates. In both types of schedule, it appears that pigeons allocate time so as to equalize the local response rates. It is apparent that the differences reported between concurrent and multiple-schedules with respect to the sensitivity with which responses are distributed between the components as a function of the distribution of reinforcers are a result of the constraints imposed on the subjects' allocation of time in multiple schedules.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2013</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parameters of Self Concept Self Efficacy and Programme Enrichment</field><field name="creator">Rawlinson, Catherine</field><field name="description">In this study a unique Enrichment Programme was designed, based upon the four curriculum models of Renzulli, Betts, Treffinger and Feldhusen. Pedagogical strategies to reinforce the development of children&#8217;s academic self concept internal locus of control, self efficacy and demonstration of potential special abilities formed an integral part of this Enrichment Programme. Instead of pre-selecting children to participate in the Enrichment Programme, this study explored the effects of changing the direction of the identification process for Children with Special Abilities. As a result, all children in the Treatment classes participated in varying stages of enrichment. The theory underpinning this intervention design was based upon Bandura's theory of reciprocal determinism and his principle of bi-directionality. In this study a pre/post experimental design was used with both the Treatment and Control groups. Seven inner city Auckland Primary schools were randomly selected to take part in this study. The Treatment group consisted of four Standards 2-4 classes, the Control group consisted of three Standards 2-4 classes. During intervention the Treatment group worked with their teachers who also attended two introductory workshops relating to the Enrichment Programme. The Control group did not participate in the Enrichment Programme; instead they worked on their regular class programme. Measures of children&#8217;s general academic self concept, locus of control and self efficacy were obtained using three questionnaires. Teachers in the Treatment and Control groups also completed an adapted version of the Renzulli/Hartman Special Ability Scale, for each child in their class at the beginning and end of the intervention phase. When combining scores for all areas measured, MANOVA showed that following intervention there was a difference between the Treatment and Control group results but this difference was not significant at the .05 level. MANOVA showed that a significant Ability effect occurred in this study regardless of whether the children were in the Treatment or Control groups. Ethnic and SES differences were also obtained but these were not significant. ANOVA using Split Plot Design for Repeated Measures focused upon the separate scores in each of the cognitive/personal and behaviour performance areas measured. In Perception of General Academic Ability neither the Treatment nor Control group made a significant increase, however a significant Ability effect was obtained. The Treatment and Control groups did not make significant increase in any of the five areas of Locus of Control and there were no significant Ability, Ethnic or SES effects in this area. The Control group made a significant increase in Self Efficacy and a significant SES effect was obtained. The Treatment group made a highly significant increase in Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Children with Special Abilities and significant Ability and SES effects were also obtained in this area. A number of Treatment groups made increases which approached significance in the area of Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Children with Special Abilities. This study illustrates that it is possible to design a class-based Enrichment Programme which enables all children to participate in varying stages of enrichment and which incorporates pedagogical strategies to reinforce academic self concept. The self efficacy results confirm Bandura&#8217;s premise that reciprocal influences do not occur simultaneously and that it takes time for a causal factor to exert its influence. This study shows that changing the direction of the identification process, by including all children in a class-based Enrichment Programme can be an effective strategy for enhancing Teachers&#8217; Recognition of Special Abilities for children from different Ability, Ethnic and SES groups.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2014</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Global Capitalism and the Revival of Ethnic Traditionalism in New Zealand: The Emergence of Tribal-Capitalism</field><field name="creator">Rata, Elizabeth , 1952-</field><field name="description">The social and economic restructuring accompanying increasing globalisation has provided new opportunities and new limits for social and ethnic movements in New Zealand as elsewhere. The purpose of this thesis is to establish the theory of tribal-capitalism through an examination of the responses to these changing global economic circumstances that have characterised the Maori ethnification, indigenisation and retribalisation movements since the 1970s. Although both the initial 'prefigurative' and the later 'strategic'(Breines, 1980:421) routes to tino rangatiratanga ('Maori sovereignty') were attempts to restore traditional social relations and secure political and economic autonomy from the dominant Pakeha society, the projects are distinguished by different approaches. On the one hand the 'prefigurative' traditionalist project indicted both capitalism and Pakeha society as its exponents sought a return to the precapitalist social relations of the pre-Contact era. On the other hand exponents of the 'strategic' project sought to establish a concordat with capitalist Pakeha society based upon the assumption that a capitalist economy could be made compatible with Maori political and cultural autonomy. It is argued that neither project, 'prefigurative' traditionalism nor the 'strategic march through the institutions of capitalism', achieved the objective of tino rangatiratanga. Irrespective of approach, Maori ethnification, indigenisation and retribalisation became reshaped and reconstituted by the conditions that made the movements possible and that shaped them in decisive ways. These tino rangatiratanga movements emerged from the institutional channels enabled by Pakeha bicultural idealists and given substance by the Waitangi Tribunal as a tribal-capitalist regime of accumulation characterised by exploitative class relations and reified communal relations. An extensive range of case studies is employed to provide evidence that tests the hypothesis of the emergence of tribal-capitalism from out of the projects that attempted to retain the traditional in a world dominated by capitalist relations. Despite the structural opportunities provided by Pakeha bicultural idealists, and despite the different approaches of the Maori tino rangatiratanga projects, it was not possible to restore communal relations of production. Objective forces, rather than internal miscalculation, ineptitude or corruption, brought about the failure as firstly 'prefigurative' and then 'strategic' projects became doomed attempts to sidestep class location within capitalist structures. The various studies examine the ways in which the 'prefigurative' and 'strategic' projects not only led to the transformation of the ethnification and indigenisation movements into the new class formations of tribal-capitalism, but actually became constitutive of the class fractions that define the regime. The dialectical interactive of agency and structure which transformed the projects became a reconstituting and shaping mechanism of change. First the study of the Pakeha new class's bicultural project grounds the later studies by locating the institutional inclusion of Maori indigenous particularity in the universalism of the new class humanists. Biculturalism established relatively benign conditions for the tino rangatiratanga projects by providing both opportunities and resources for Maori development. It is in the retribalising form of that development that an indigenous version of the capitalist regime of accumulation is located. The next three sections of the thesis examine the 'prefigurative' and 'strategic' routes of this indigenous particularity into the new inclusive structures in studies of: a reviving Maori family, an ascendant tribe, a separate Maori education system and the creation of the national Maori fishing industry. The outcomes of each study are examined to trace the failure of both approaches as particular groups within the retribalisation movement developed new and exclusive relationships to the traditional lands, waters and knowledge. The concluding section contrasts culturalist theories of the Maori tino rangatiratanga projects with the hypothesis of the emergence of tribal-capitalism advanced in this thesis. The claim that cultural strength can resist the imposition of capitalist class relations is found not to be sustained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The PPTA and the State: from militant professionals to bargaining agent : a study of rational opportunism</field><field name="creator">Jesson, Jocelyn Gavin</field><field name="description">This thesis using oral historiographic techniques examines the changing role and function of a teachers' union during changes in the nature of a national State which can also be related to changing forms of capitalism. The teachers' union is New Zealand Post-Primary Teachers Association (the secondary school teachers' union) and the period of particular focus is between 1983 and the beginning of 1993. This is the period of a crisis in the New Zealand State during which the character of the national State was moved from what has been described as a 'wage earners' Welfare State towards a more residual form providing a 'modest safety net'. The financial and the labour market were deregulated to become more free of direct State involvement. The administration of education was changed and the individual schools' elected Boards of Trustees were made responsible for the provision of schooling. The role of PPTA in the State is moved structurally in this time. As a professional association before the changes, PPTA had both opportunity for input into the mandate of education, as well as the possibility of creating implementation pressure through political action. As a bargaining agent, the input role of PPTA to decisions in education was limited to addressing members' concerns at the school level. The restructuring of education and of the labour market, PPTA was both an object to be acted on and a participant obstructing the changes. This thesis presents what is a PPTA view of those changes. PPTA formed a central part of the education structures which were to be transformed by the economic liberal project. The survival of PPTA demonstrates the extent to which the project was not completed and the resistance of PPTA was one of the reasons why the project in education could not be completed. The thesis is in three parts. Part one is a regulationist-derived periodisation of the historical development of the New Zealand wage earners Welfare State and education. This is followed by a consideration of the economic-liberal challenge to this State Part two considers the development of PPTA's professional project and the possibilities presented through different arenas. Part three focuses on the changing nature of the State labour market policy and PPTA's activity in that. The changing strategies and tactics of PPTA's 'professional project', the thesis argues, occur under changing political conditions and are an example of Offe's concept of rational opportunism</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2016</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identity, difference and politics: a poststructuralist investigation</field><field name="creator">Chueh, Ho-chia</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the ways in which concepts of binary opposition are elaborated in some of the key contemporary theories on difference and identity. This project contributes to the emerging scholarship on the notion of emancipation and empowerment in educational theory. It explores discourses of difference and identity that are engaged with constructions and re-construction of the notions of Self and Other. This thesis develops a systematic analysis of texts with arguments on political performance of representation and agency. The thesis begins with an examination of Hegel's thesis on the relationship between the lord and the bondsman which is implemented in the political discourses of John Rex and Paulo Freire. It continues to examine political theses with emphasis on the relationship between the mind and the body; examinations include theses offered by Robert Miles and Frantz Fanon. This thesis also explores the methodological value of concepts of binary opposition; it explores Claude L&#233;vi-Strauss' theory on cultural differences and examines Iris M. Young and Chantal Mouffe's discourses on the 'politics of difference'. This thesis further explores Jacques Derrida's notions of deconstruction and diff&#233;rence together with analyses and critiques of Homi Bhabha's and Gayatri Spivak's reconstruction of concepts of binary oppositions. This thesis calls for a consideration of Derrida's thoughts on the political as an approach to the understanding difference and identity. I propose a double reading of the texts examined in this thesis: on the one hand, they are genealogical analyses to understand and criticise the ways in which knowledge on (racial and cultural) difference and identity have been constructed. On the other hand, they are given affirmations of political significance with their performative effectiveness that language allows them to achieve.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Rhetoric of mysticism</field><field name="creator">Adams, Peter James</field><field name="description">Research into mystical experience has to date relied primarily on retrospective self reports of mystical states. Analysis of such reports assumes a direct correspondence between their content and the content of the experiences. But experiencers themselves often express dissatisfaction with the capacity of language to convey these states, and the language they do choose to use is typically vague and ambiguous. The current dissertation argues that vagueness is not an accidental nor an unfortunate feature of mystical communications. Because of difficulties in direct expression, mystical communicators rely on the active and imaginative participation of the listener/reader to complete the expression. A theory of provocative gaps is developed to explain how this operates. A "gap" is conceived of as an open receptacle in linguistic space. It provides a site within a discourse upon which receptive listeners/readers can insert content from their own experience. Gaps can be created by blatant omissions of content, but in written descriptions are more likely to occur in indirect forms by exploiting subtleties in grammar and meaning. A simple diagrammatic system is developed for explaining the gap-provoking potential of several major rhetorical strategies. Three studies were designed to explore whether and at what frequency written testimonials of mystical experience exploit a selection of 31 of these gap-provoking strategies: the first study exposed their high frequency in extracts by well-known published mystics; the second indicated similarly high frequencies for the average person's description; and the third found significantly higher rates in mystical testimonials than in descriptions by the same participants of dream or travel experiences. A similar use of vagueness can be found in the language of hypnotic trance induction, and as an adjunct to the second study, the hypnotic susceptibility of 81 subjects was assessed and results indicated that subjects with mystical inclinations were more susceptible to hypnosis than those without. The general support of the studies for a theory of provocative gaps suggests that the notion of intentional vagueness could have useful application in the study of other types of communication, including: the media, art criticism, teaching, psychotherapy and academic discourse.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1991.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Painting life in extremes Charles Maturin and the Gothic genre</field><field name="creator">Dunsford, Cathie</field><field name="description">Charles Robert Maturin (1780-1824) produced a substantial body of writing that included six novels, three plays, and two collections of sermons. Despite the large audience he reached in his own time, and the interest he aroused in a number of later poets and novelists, Maturin's work has not received very much serious attention from critics. The present study attempts to take a fresh look at all Maturin's work, exploring it sympathetically from a variety of directions. Melmoth is included, but because it has dominated previous discussion of Maturin, I have chosen to concentrate on his neglected novels, Fatal Revenge, The Wild Irish Boy, The Milesian Chief, Women, or Pour et Contre, and The Albigenses. Special attention is given here to Maturin's two volumes of sermons (a valuable but seldom used source of information about his religious philosophy) and, more generally, to the theme of religion, which links many of his novels. This aspect of Gothic literature deserves a closer study than it usually receives, particularly in the work of Maturin who was a minister of religion. My thesis proposes a new interpretation of Fatal Revenge based on the parallel that Maturin developed between the use of superstition by Orazio and its use by the Catholic church. In The Albigenses there is a similar parallel between the outlaws and the supposedly holy Crusaders. Maturin took the Catholic church so often as his subject, not simply because it provided a colourful, stereotyped background (as some have suggested), but because it was a context in which he could seriously investigate the psychological pressures that produced (and still produce) conformity, extremism, and sexual violence. While his studies of oppressive societies may at times remind us of twentieth-century works such as 1984 or The Trial, Maturin's fiction is very much a part of its age. After a chapter that explores the history of 'the Gothic', my thesis focuses on the particular context of Maturin's period, mapping it initially by examining the responses to his work that appeared in print during his lifetime. Those reviews and essays make visible the complex field of forces in which Maturin worked. The Gothic novel developed in an age of more than usual ferment - literary, religious, and political - including the first phase of what we would today describe as feminist rebellion. All this was accompanied, as we can see from the criticism, by a strong conservative reaction in defence of the threatened values. The present study emphasizes the ways in which Maturin's work shared the new energies associated with change, even though it also displayed signs of ambivalence. I consider the reasons for this ambivalence and argue that in many cases there is subtlety in what appears at first to be confusion. Maturin's fiction was a late addition to the Gothic tradition, but its particular kinds of complexity - such as its psychological depth - made it an important development of the genre and linked it with other innovative writing of the period. Some admirers of Maturin have sought to play down the Gothic element in his work, which is understandable in view of the low esteem in which the genre has been held. The Gothic has often been seen, for example, as a confused rehearsal for Romanticism. While acknowledging the variety of Maturin's novels, I have sought to emphasise their continuing links with the Gothic genre and its special energies. During the past decade, new forms of Gothic criticism have appeared that treat the subject with greater seriousness. Today, interest in the Gothic genre seems to be springing to life again, and its relevance to our own time (which is also a period of complex social change and widespread ambivalence) has become clearer. I have attempted to contribute to this new type of criticism by pointing out the value of Maturin's studies of oppression and his ability to go beyond stereotypes in his treatment of women characters. I have also suggested some links between Gothic literature and feminist science-fiction writing today. In general, the aim of this thesis has been to consider the most mature Gothic fiction (such as that of Maturin) not merely as fantasy but as an expanded vision of reality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2024</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Linking process quality with performance: an empirical study of New Zealand manufacturing plants</field><field name="creator">Sluti, Donald George</field><field name="description">This study was conducted to assess the impacts of quality on operational and business performance in manufacturing firms. Data were provided by 184 diversified New Zealand manufacturing plants- Quality is defined as the degree of conformance to specifications. The first phase of the research was the construction of a theoretical model to incorporate the impacts of quality on manufacturing performance, manufacturing productivity and business performance. The relationships of the model are based on the quality management literature. The second phase of the research was the design and administration of a survey instrument for the collection of empirical performance data. The data were then used to evaluate the relationships represented in the model. The final phase of the research used structural equations modelling in order to evaluate the relationships of the model. Quality was found to have significant and positive impacts on operational performance measures for process utilization, process output, production costs, work-in-process inventory levels and on-time delivery rate. The analysis found that change in quality level was most strongly associated with change in process utilization. The findings for the impacts of quality on operational performance were compatible with the quality management literature. The impacts of quality on business performance given by structural equations analysis were significant and positive for productivity-induced improvements of quality. Generally, the support for the impacts of quality on business performance which occur through other aspects of, operational performance was not significant. The limitations of the study were specified. The implications of the findings of the study for manufacturers were reviewed, along with the directions for future research.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Management Science and Information Systems)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2028</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The challenge for tomorrow's schools: learning to be responsive</field><field name="creator">Timperley, Helen</field><field name="description">Changes recently introduced in the administration of New Zealand education were intended to ensure that schools would become more responsive to their communities. Many aspects of school governance were devolved from a central government bureaucracy to Boards of Trustees at each school and greater choice of school was given to parents. In this thesis I examine the assumptions underlying these policy changes and propose a model of the processes necessary for the development of school responsiveness. The research progressed over four phases. In the first I survey beliefs and practices in 38 Auckland schools about the new school-community partnership established by the devolution of governance responsibility to the Boards of Trustees. This survey was followed by a second more extensive questionnaire survey on the same topic in ten of these schools. The role educational values might play in parents' choice of school and their perceptions of school responsiveness were addressed in a survey of five secondary schools in the second phase. The third phase comprised case studies of two schools which had contrasting community-school relationships. In one school the principal valued a close partnership with the community, yet the school roll had fallen steadily over a five year period. In the other school, which enjoyed a rapidly increasing roll, the principal believed educational decisions should be left to the professionals. The case studies investigated this apparent contradiction, that the partnership relationship between parents and professionals which was designed to increase school responsiveness appeared to be unrelated to roll trends, a possible indicator of responsiveness. In the fourth phase I describe and evaluate how the school with the declining roll attempted to become more responsive to its community. The research results show that the concept of responsiveness contained in the initial policy documents was simplistic in that neither a community-school partnership nor school choice was sufficient to improve responsiveness to the community. I propose a more focused concept of responsiveness than that contained in the policy documents and identify two critical attributes of this concept; the school's educational values and parents' concerns about school practice. Parents choose schools because they perceive that the professionals share their educational values. I suggest that establishing cohesive values, both between home and school and within the school itself, is educationally desirable and critical to achieving responsiveness. This cohesion, however, should be enacted in a way which respects the diversity within the school population if some students are not to be alienated by the values of the majority. The second attribute of responsiveness, acting on valid concerns of parents, involves parents in decisions about school practice of greatest importance to them. Vague calls for consultation on school policy do not achieve this aim. My proposed concept of responsiveness does not assume that parents dominate areas previously reserved for professional prerogative, but rather that parents and professionals jointly determine policy in those areas critical to achieving responsiveness. School-community partnerships and school choice will not result in responsiveness unless they serve as catalysts for professional learning about the values and concerns of the community. This learning is enhanced if schools encourage parents to exercise influence and engage in joint problem-solving. Achieving school responsiveness depends more on the attitudes and skills of the participants in the partnership than on the structural changes enacted in the recent legislation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330104 Educational policy, administration and management</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2029</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Latest Cretaceous to late Paleocene Radiolaria from Marlborough (New Zealand) and DSDP site 208</field><field name="creator">Hollis, C. J.</field><field name="description">This is the first study of cretaceous or Paleogene Radiolaria from on-land New Zealand. It is based on five Late Cretaceous to Paleocene sections within the Amuri Limestone Group of eastern Marlborough (NE South Island): Woodside Creek, Wharanui Point, Chancet Rocks, Flaxbourne River and Mead Stream. Faunas from coeval sediments at DSDP Site 208 (Lord Howe Rise, north Tasman Sea) are also reexamined. Because diverse and well-preserved radiolarian faunas are common, the location of the Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary well-documented, and the earliest Paleocene relatively complete, these sections provide the most complete known record of radiolarian evolution from latest Cretaceous to mid Late Paleocene (c.70-60 Ma). Systematic treatment of K-T transitional faunas was hampered by a dichotomy between Cenozoic and Mesozoic methodologies and nomenclature. To resolve this schism, broad taxonomic definitions are adopted, numerous synonymies are identified, and several revised definitions are proposed for established taxa. Of the 94 taxa recorded, 65 are species or species groups, and 29 are undifferentiated genera or higher level categories. Three new species are described: Amphisphaera aotea n.sp., A. kina n.sp. and Stichomitra wero n.sp. A new latest Cretaceous to mid Late Paleocene zonation is proposed. Six new interval zones are defined by the first appearances of the nominated species. In ascending order these are: Lithomelissa? hoplites (RK9, Cretaceous), Amphisphaera aotea (RP1, Paleocene), A. kina (RP2), Stichomitra granulata (RP3), Buryella foremanae (RP4) and B. tetradica (RP5) Interval Zones. The Late Paleocene Bekoma campechensis Zone of Nishimura (1987) succeeds RP5 at Mead Stream. The K/T boundary does not mark an extinction event for radiolarians, but does coincide with a sudden change from nassellarian to spumellarian dominance. It also coincides with a sudden influx of diatoms in Marlborough, where a fall in sea level appears to have promoted upwelling. Thus, rather than marking a catastrophe, the K/T boundary heralded a period (from RP1 to lower RP3) of great productivity for siliceous plankton. With a return to conditions similar to those of the Cretaceous, later in the Paleocene (upper RP3-RP6), Cretaceous survivors were rapidly replaced by new Tertiary taxa in deep-water settings. However, in shallower settings, many Cretaceous taxa remained abundant throughout the Early Paleocene. Faunal changes at site 208 are similar to those of the deep-water Marlborough sections, but without clear evidence for increased fertilty in the earliest Paleocene.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2031</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel synthetic anthracyclinones</field><field name="creator">Holroyd, Stephen Eyre</field><field name="description">Lewis acid mediated cyclisations of the ortho allyl substituted homochiral hydroxyanthraquinone acetals (37), (38), (43), and (44), prepared via optimised reductive Claisen rearrangements have been investigated. The mono and dichloro tetracyclic species (71-74), (76), (77), (83), (84), (87-90) and novel dioxepins (97), (98), (101), (102) have been synthesised and their stereochemistries assigned using NMR techniques. Mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of most of the products. An SN2-like process in which the dioxolane ring structure is maintained in an ion pair intermediate is favoured when tin(IV) or titanium(IV) chloride are used at lower temperatures (-78&#176;C). Such a path explains the good C7 stereoselectivity in the generation of the anthracyclinones. Thereafter the direction of chloride addition is governed by the orientation of this ion pair which provides the chloride to C-9 on the A-ring. An alternative path predominates when boron trifluoride etherate is used and at higher temperatures. This probably involves a free oxocarbenium ion which explains the poor C7 stereoselectivity, since either face of the oxocarbenium ion is equally accessible to the incoming nucleophilic olefin. An adjacent methoxy group on the anthraquinone ring lowers the stereoselectivity at both C7 and C9. This effect is explained by invoking bidentate coordination of either tin(IV) or titanium(IV) chloride to the quinone carbonyl, the methoxy oxygen and the acetal. The resultant steric interactions raise the energy of the favoured transition state and thus the acetal reacts via a different conformation, or the SN1-like path may be favoured, both of which afford a lower stereoselectivity. When titanium(IV) chloride is used with the isobutylene substituted methoxy anthraquinonyl acetal (37) a reversal in C7 stereoselectivity is found which has been explained as due to a favouring of reaction in which the other acetal oxygen has become complexed. With these substrates trimethylsilyl triflate does not induce the desired acetal/alkene cyclisation, rather the isobutylene substituted acetals (37) and (38) giving the dimethyl furans (68) and (69), while the vinyl chlorides (43) and (44) were largely unreactive. Preliminary studies on modifications aimed at introducing oxygen bearing functionality at C9 in the mono and dichloro tetracyclic species have been carried out. The potential of the acetal from condensation of the conduritol dimethyl ether (140) and the aldehyde (35) in syntheses of novel anthracyclines bearing a 7-cyclitol substituent has been studied. The cyclohexenyl acetals (143), (153), (154), and (157) have been prepared but their reactions with a variety of Lewis acids give the appropriate napthacenediones (67), (91), (133), and (155) as the only tetracyclic products isolated. It is proposed that coordination of the &#945;-methoxy groups to the Lewis acid diverts the reaction paths. A one-pot reductive Claisen/Ene reaction of the aldehyde (35) has been optimised as a method for preparing the tetracyclic anthracyclinone (163). Further modifications of this tetracycle have been investigated. Preliminary studies of a route aimed at utilising a Dieckmann condensation to furnish anthracyclinone precursors were side-tracked when rather than the desired furans an iodoetherification reaction gave a series of novel iodomethylfurans and furanocyclopropanes. The use of palladium(II) bisacetonitrile to simultaneously cleave the allyl ether and conjugate the C-allyl double bond of (33) to afford (217) has been investigated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250100 Physical Chemistry (Incl.

Those who refused or dropped out of treatment were followed up in a semi-control group. A broad range of patient measures were taken at intake and 6 and 18 months afterwards, when 86% of subjects were located. No treatment was more effective than another (in terms of statistically significant differences) in helping subjects to abstain or drink less, nor did any treatment appear to be more effective than another in promoting social and psychological recovery. Furthermore, those who stayed in treatment did not show significantly more long-term improvement than those who refused or dropped out of treatment. Two programmes did significantly reduce the alcohol consumption of the alcoholics assigned to them at the 6-month follow-up compared to those who dropped out, but by 18 months there was no longer a significant treatment effect. Although the two follow-ups showed individual drinking patterns were unstable, on average almost half the subjects located had improved either because they had abstained or were drinking moderately. There were only small gains on direct measures of social adjustment. Compared to the general New Zealand population, subjects were more likely to be divorced or separated, manual workers and unemployed. Nonetheless, these characteristics did not contribute to predicting the subjects' response to treatment. Multiple regression equations explained between 33% and 57% of the variance in amount drunk after treatment. The patients' own predictions of their chances of drinking again, evidence of electrocardiographic abnormalities and the patients&#8217; net weekly incomes, were more consistent variables in explaining drinking levels and predicting abstinence in the long term than the demographic and psychological variables. Variables that were significant in explaining drinking levels were often not significant when it came to predicting abstinence and vice versa. Abstinent subjects felt more often than drinkers that they had achieved the goals that they had set themselves aria by the final follow-up there were many positive differences in lifestyle apparent. Thus, in the final outcome, although abstinence was clearly demonstrated to be a worthwhile goal, no treatment was significantly more effective than another in helping to achieve this goal. Patients who underwent treatment apparently showed greater recovery than those who dropped out of treatment but this result was also not statistically significant.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1984.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2033</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poetry in New Zealand 1850-1930</field><field name="creator">Kingsbury, Anthony Leicester</field><field name="description">Poetry in New Zealand, nearly everyone agrees, came to birth around 1920, or 1930, or 1940; in fact, round about when those who are now the grand old men of New Zealand letters were boys.

The different perspectives include management theory, strategic management and international business perspectives, and the competency-based approach to management effectiveness in the United Kingdom, The United States, and New Zealand. The research programme used a blend of quantitative and qualitative techniques. Each phase of research is supported by a review of the international literature and empirical field work conducted in New Zealand. A research tool relatively new to management research, Concept Mapping (Trochim, 1989a, 1989b), was to allow qualitative verbal statements to be described in terms of both quantitative and spatial relationships. A singular advantage of Concept Mapping is that collection and analysis of data is conducted without imposing research constructs at any stage, and a distillation of a core set of skills and characteristics can be derived through the reiterative process of Concept Mapping. In addition to Concept Mapping sessions with practicing managers and management educators and developers, two national surveys were conducted. In essence, the research builds a framework of the factors influencing managerial effectiveness through literature reviews and empirical work to generate a predictor variable list then tests that list for predictive strength. The primary outcomes of the research were: 1) the identification of a set of skills and characteristics that discriminate classes of effectiveness and ineffectiveness; and 2) the provision of a conceptual framework for analysing the similarities and differences between models of managerial effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350200 Business and Management</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Management and Employment Relations)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Social Identity of Teams at Work</field><field name="creator">Lembke, Swantje (Svan)</field><field name="description">This dissertation investigates the management of teams at work. A thorough examination of the literature on small groups, coupled with field research on the implementation of teamwork in the New Zealand operations of a large multinational provides insights about how members of a team think. It is shown that the perception of membership by team members influences their ability to make effective use of resources and make informed decisions, not only within the team, but also with regard to its impact on the organisation. Social identity theory provides a theoretical model for the psychological processes of team membership. The processes of categorisation, self-categorisation and social identification are mapped against the introduction of teamwork over a period of two years to assess whether or not they are relevant. The results from surveys of and interviews with senior staff members support the processes described by social identity theory, where groups can operate as separate cognitive and emotional units as relevant for the management of teams at work. Because of the unique psychological processes, team members at work have to be interacted with (and be given information) differently than individuals in order to behave as a high-performing team. This study develops the implications of social identity theory for the introduction and management of teams at work, leading to high performance for the organisation.

These three different perspectives are seen, first, at the level of the empirical evidence of concentration and centralisation over time, and second, at the level of theoretical explanation and lastly, at the level of the sociology of knowledge, that is, how the theories themselves locate within economic cycles. The two empirical bases of this study are the survey of the top thirty companies directors and the top thirty companies networks of.1966, 1976 and 1986. A centrality analysis used on the latter three data sources, found that at the peak of the longwave (1966) when accumulation was high within the protected New Zealand economy, there were few corporate interlocks, suggesting that centralisation (the destruction of already formed capitals) was not a problem. But by the economic downturn (1986) corporate interlocks had proliferated reflecting the insecure nature of the corporate economy in crisis. The main conclusions drawn from the survey and the centralisation data sources positively corroborate the Marxist thesis that the corporate class fraction (as agents of capitalism) are in a free market economy as much directive as reactive to the state, that banks operate at direct and indirect levels of intervention on this class fraction and that there is some evidence of corporate class cohesion.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Sociology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies with podocarpic acid</field><field name="creator">Robertson, John David</field><field name="description">A series of reactions of podocarpic acid has been investigated.

Regulation involves constructing an additional control input which depends upon the difference between the actual system state and the desired state. This requires the construction of a state estimate from raw data about system input and output. For effective state estimation, the sensor input gain to the state estimator needs to be time-varying. Under certain assumptions, the appropriate input gain can be specified analytically. The feedback regulation signal can then be constructed as a function of the state estimate. For effective regulation, the gain of the feedback function has to vary during maneuvers. Under certain assumptions an appropriate feedback gain can be specified analytically. The state observer input gain equations have a simple relationship to the feedback gain equations, so that gain specification is essentially the same task in each case. Cerebellar research has been dominated for the past 25 years by the theories of James Albus and David Marr. These mathematicians proposed similar models in which certain synapses in the cerebellar cortex are continuously modified by experience in such a way that movements which are consistently repeated under a given set of circumstances come to be performed automatically by the cerebellum. Much experimental work has focussed on the role of the vestibulo-cerebellum in fine control and learning of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The state of the art along this line is formally described by Fujita's adaptive filter model of the cerebellar cortex. In chapter 4 it is shown that a basic feature of Fujita's model is inconsistent with available evidence. The 'Tensorial theory of brain function' is discussed in chapter 5. This is a novel theory of brain function which has been used in an attempt two explain cerebellar function. The attempt is a failure, based on sophistocated misconceptions and flawed by poor reasoning and clumsy analysis. The approach serves to confuse rather than clarify the question of cerebellar function. The final chapter of the first part of the thesis presents a basis for a new approach to cerebellar function based on the engineering theory of control of multivariate dynamical systems. It is proposed that the cerebellum is involved in movement regulation by controlling the gains of brainstem motor pathways, and in mapping the animal's environment by controlling the gains of sensory inputs to the midbrain. While learning undoubtedly does occur in the cerebellar cortex, this is not specifically a 'learning device', as commonly conceived. The second part of the thesis is concerned with the development and application of a method of system identification for characterising the dynamics of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and its components in an elasmobranch. The chosen method involves pulse-rate modulated bilateral electrical stimulation of the horizontal semicircular canal ampullary nerves. This produces a synthetic vestibulo-ocular reflex in a stationary preparation. The stimulus pattern is a pseudorandom binary sequence of pulse rates, so that cross-correlation of the stimulus pattern with the response signal gives a Unit Impulse Response dynamic signature for the system. Computer software for signal generation, recording, analysis and display was written by the author. The identification system was applied first to characterise the dynamics of the eye movement response to horizontal canal ampullary nerve stimulation, and compare this to the dynamics of the eye motor plant alone. The eye motor preparation acts as a first order low-pass filter with a time constant of about 0.2 seconds (16&#176;C), while the ampullary preparation acts as a second order low-pass filter with a dominant time constant of about 0.75 seconds (16&#176;C). Central pathways of the elasmobranch vestibulo-ocular reflex extend the time constant of the motor plant by a factor of 3-4, as in other animals. Eye movements predicted by fitted linear models accurately mimic eye movements recorded during experiments, suggesting both that central pathways of the reflex operate normally during this somewhat un-naturally evoked response and that the identification procedure is effective. Furthermore, combination of the ampullary nerve to eye movement transfer function obtained in this study, with head rotation to ampullary nerve transfer functions obtained by other workers, gives a consistent picture of elasmobranch vestibulo-ocular reflex function predicting compensatory eye movements in the band 0.2 - 4.0 Hz., and perhaps higher. The identification method has also been applied to produce models of vestibulocerebellar Purkinje cell dynamics during electrically evoked vestibular eye movements. Linear identification gives a poor characterisation of Purkinje cell activity during the high frequency vestibulo-ocular reflex. This is incompatible with linear phase-compensator models of the cerebellar cortex, but consistent with the reflex gain modulation theory of cerebellar function advocated in the first part of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1985.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteins and transcripts involved in mini-F maintenance</field><field name="creator">Phua, Sin Hen</field><field name="description">The aim of the work described in this thesis was to understand the maintenance systems of the F plasmid of Escherichia coli. The work was centered on the biochemical studies of the primary replicative fragment of F, f5. 1. From an analysis of the protein species produced by miniF-vector hybrid plasmids in E. coli minicells, seven proteins were found to be encoded by f5. Similarly, the secondary F replicon, f7, was found to code for at least three proteins. 2. The f5-specific proteins were further characterized by determining their isoelectric points and molecular weights in two-dimensional gels. 3. Using transposon-induced and deletion mutants of miniF, the structural genes of the seven f5 proteins were mapped. 4. Analysis of the amounts of proteins made by transposon-insertion mutants revealed that some miniF proteins control the expression of miniF genes. These results suggested possible mechanisms of coordination between the three f5 maintenance systems (ccd, rep and par). 5. The polarities of the f5 transcripts synthesized in minicells were determined by hybridization with f5 DNA cloned in to single-stranded phage M13 vectors. The results were consistent with the gene mapping data, in that the directions of transcription of the seven f5 structural genes are uniformly rightwards. 6. In addition, the RNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the existence of untranslated leftward transcripts produced from the regions involved in f5 replication and partition.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cell Biology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2042</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's understanding of sexual orientation</field><field name="creator">Saphira, Miriam Edna</field><field name="description">In 1989 New Zealand is considering legislation which will make discrimination against lesbians, transexuals and gay men illegal. To increase children's understanding of sexual orientations educators need to have some knowledge of what children already understand and how children use their information. The three studies address this issue in spite of the difficulties in obtaining permission to ask children about homosexuality. A homophobia questionnaire was administered to 290 first year psychology students. They were also asked to recall their childhood feelings about gay people when they first met a homosexual and first understood the concept of homosexuality. Older women were the least homophobic. A second study was carried out with 5, 7, and 11 year old children in three schools with a family discrimination task. A third of the 11 year olds could label the couples of the same sex as gay, homosexual or lesbian and gave more positive items to the two-parent families. A third study involved 31 children from two-parent families and 32 from lesbian families. Out of the 63 six to ten year olds, 27 could define 'homosexual' and 'gay' and 37 could define lesbian. Twenty could use a strategy to recognise a lesbian. Although social discrimination against non-heterosexual orientations placed some constraints on this research, it yielded preliminary evidence for the emergence of children's understanding of sexual orientations between 7 and 11 years of age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2043</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and genetic analysis of RepA from the P307 RepFIB replicon</field><field name="creator">Spiers, Andrew J. (Andrew Julian)</field><field name="description">The work in this Thesis concerns the replication control system of the P307 plasmid RepFIB replicon. The basic replicon occupies &#8776; 1.6kb of DNA and contains a single large open reading frame (repA) flanked on either side by a series DNA repeat elements. The organisational structure of fie replicon has placed RepFIB into the Step function class of replicons. The placement of RepFIB within this group, as well as a strong homology between RepFIB and mini-P1, has resulted in a series of predictions concerning the control elements of RepFIB replication. The aim of this work was to test some of these predictions and to characterise the fundamental control elements utilised by the replicon. This Thesis describes three different active promoter elements found embedded within the repeat elements flanking repA. Although the functional significance of two of the promoter is unknown (orip and EFp), the third is responsible for the expression of RepA and has been designated 'repAp'. All three promoters are sensitive to RepA in trans, demonstrating that repA is autoregulated and that RepA is a DNA-binding protein capable of recognising copies of the repeat elements. RepA DNA-binding has also been demonstrated in vitro using a modification of the Western analysis technique (referred to a 'Western-DNA') in order to complement the in vivo experimental results. Although the coding region of repA had been determined in earlier work, the identification of the translational start codon was uncertain. This uncertainty has been resolved by limited N-terminal sequence analysis of a RepA:&#946;-galactosidase fusion protein which has demonstrated that translation begins from a CTG codon located upstream of the predicted start sites. Finally, a series of genetic experiments have been used to determine the functional significance of RepA binding to the repeat elements. The repeat group upstream of repA are involved in autoregulation and also form part of the origin of replication, whilst the downstream repeats appear to be involved in the sensing and setting of plasmid copy number. Although the work presented in this Thesis does not directly test the applicability for RepFIB of various control models proposed to explain the behaviour of Step function replicons, the nature and type of control elements identified in RepFIB support the placement of RepFIB within the Step function class. As a result of this work, it is clear that RepFIB is confronted by the same kind of control paradox faced by replicons such as mini-P1 and mini-F. All three replicons use autoregulation and titration to control the supply of initiator protein required for replication. However, concurrent autoregulation and titration appear to be incompatible in current control models, and the identification of both mechanisms in these replicons has lead to a control paradox. Some of the results presented here suggest potentially valuable avenues of future research which may help resolve the paradox faced by RepFIB and other Step function replicons.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Christina Stead: the American years</field><field name="creator">Segerberg, Anita Kristina</field><field name="description">CHRISTINA STEAD (1902-1983) is a major Australian woman writer, and this thesis explores one of the least known periods in her life and work, the years she spent in the United States (1937- 7946). During this time she wrote her two best known novels, The Man Who Loved Children and For Love Alone, both based on autobiographical material. This study explores contextual aspects of Stead's life and work in New York, drawing on a considerable amount of new material. (Chapters I and II) During this period Stead wrote partly out of a personal need to understand her own life situation, and psychological readings of three novels, The Man who Loved Children, For Love Alone and Letty Fox, seen as a 'father trilogy', are designed to open up new lines of enquiry into aspects of all of these novels. (Chapters III and IV) The thesis also discusses formal aspects of Stead's work, beginning with her own formulation of an esthetics of the novel, which occurred during a course she gave in New York in 1943 called Workshop in the Novel. (Chapter V) The relevance of this course for her own practice as a novelist is also explored, with particular reference to the two later American novels A Little TeA, A Little Chat and, The People with The Dogs. (Chapter VI) In Chapter VII an exploration of Stead's interest in the genre of the novella, focussing on the collection The Puzzleheaded Girl, continues the formal lines of enquiry opened up in the previous two chapters, and in the following chapter the same collection provides a starting point for a consideration of Stead's deep interest in the situation of women in modern society, especially the recurrent figure of the wanderer or female rebel. The last chapter concentrates on the literary self-portraits which appeared in Stead's American fiction after The Man who Loved Children and For Love Alone, and their curiously limited characterization is compared with the more vigorous portrait of her provided in one of the novels of her husband, William Blake. This thesis, then, argues that Stead's life fed her fiction, especially in her American period, and that her work was part of a broader personal quest. Understanding this quest is relevant to a discussion of her literary style, and to her personal use of autobiographical material in her fiction, and it illuminates aspects of the creative process itself. Stead's need to understand her own life not only shaped her fiction, it also provided it with the 'intelligent ferocity' she aimed for, and resulted in a major 'realist' writer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2046</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wit at several weapons: a critical edition</field><field name="creator">Sharp, Iain</field><field name="description">The text which follows is a critical modern spelling edition of &#8216;Wit at Several Weapons&#8217; devised according to the principles established for the editors of the Revels series of English Renaissance plays.

Social referencing research has also been conducted exclusively in the university laboratory. Three studies examined the influence of self-produced locomotion on the development of social referencing and compared social referencing behaviour in familiar and unfamiliar settings. Social referencing was defined as occurring when, following a novel event, infants looked to a familiar adult and used the information provided by the adult to adjust their behaviour towards the event appropriately. In the first study, forty infants, half locomoting and half non-locomoting, were seen in their own homes at either 7-months (10 crawling, l0 not crawling) or 9-months (10 crawling, l0 not crawling). Testing was repeated on all infants 2 months later. Infants were videotaped in each of three maternal availability conditions (mother available; not available; or not interactive) before a remote control toy car moved toward them. Mothers were instructed to give either a positive or negative facial signal when their infant looked at them during this final phase. The infants were responsive to the availability of the mother on a number of dependent measures. Locomoting infants approached their mothers more, played with the toys less, and differed in some aspects of looking behaviour during the availability phases. During the final social referencing phase neither group consistently used the information provided by the mother to change their behaviour. A second study examined a further ten, 9-month-old infants using an identical procedure. The infants were delayed in the onset of self-produced locomotion due to surgical and immobilization procedures prescribed for club foot. This group did not differ from the normal non-crawling 9-month-olds in the availability phases of the study but did look to their mothers more quickly and vocalized less during the social referencing phase. The third study used a similar procedure and identical novel stimulus to examine 20, 11-month-old infants' social referencing behaviour in a laboratory situation. There was a significant difference between the infants who received a positive versus negative message for the contact with the car measures. When they received a negative message, infants tested in the laboratory were less likely to touch the stimulus car and touched it for a shorter time than infants of the same age and tested at home. Mothers of all infants participating in this study completed the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire. None of the infant characteristics predicted which infants would use the social referencing strategy. It is concluded that social referencing is not a strategy used extensively by 7-and 9-month old infants although social looking is common at these ages in response to new events. Locomotion experience has little effect on social referencing. Infants use information from a variety of sources to assess a new situation and 11-month-old infants are more likely to use social referencing as a strategy in an unfamiliar setting. Theoretical implications of the results are discussed in relation to the cognitive requirements of preverbal and emotional communication and the relative importance of social influences for interpreting novel events.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical studies of copper and thallium</field><field name="creator">Bailey, Peter Charles Ash</field><field name="description">The anodic growth of a Cu2O film on polycrystalline copper surfaces was studied by a potentiostatic method. Plots of anodic current versus time allowed the growth law to be determined and the Cu2O film thickness was found to vary linearly with the cube root of time. The same growth law applied when Cu2O films were formed by aqueous oxygen attack at the copper surfaces. A mechanism has been proposed explaining this law, based on assumptions of Cabrera and Mott for gaseous oxidation of copper. The cyclic voltammetry technique was used to study the growth, dissolution and reduction of Cu2O and the higher copper oxides over the pH range 5.20 to 13.83. Cu2O was the first oxide formed, and depending on the pH, either CuO or Cu(OH)2 was formed over the underlying Cu2O at higher potentials. In NaOH solutions, of concentration 0.10M and greater, presence of the oxide, Cu2O3 was noted at potentials corresponding to oxygen evolution. During cathodic reduction of the films formed anodically, the Cu(II) product was initially reduced to Cu2O, followed by Cu2O reduction to Cu metal. Solid state reactions for the growth, dissolution and reduction processes are included. No explanation for peak formation during anodic film growth by the cyclic voltammetry technique can be found but plateau formation is predicted. The inclusion of chloride in the anodically formed films increased the conductivity of the oxide films greatly. A 0.100M Na2B407 solution containing 9.6 x 10-4M benzotriazole was found to inhibit the formation of films at the copper surface probably by the formation of a Cu(BTA) polymer. The presence of sodium hexametaphosphate had no effect on oxide growth kinetics at pH 9.18. Potentials of specimens of copper piping corroding in Auckland's supply water were measured against a saturated calomel electrode. The values depended largely on the conditions of water flow and stagnation. Illumination and surface preparation of the samples had little effect. The corrosion potentials reached a maximum after approximately 30 days and the high potentials observed were attributed to the resistance of the films of corrosion products covering the metal surface. A mechanism for the corrosion process has been proposed with the electrophoretic deposition of a layer of silica gel over the underlying Cu2O film causing local cell action and the formation of anodic and cathodic areas over the copper surface. The gel allows diffusion of Cu2+ into the solution from the anodic regions and OH-from the cathodic regions, forming a loosely adherent flocc of Cu(OH)2 the metal surface. This flocc is readily scoured from the surface leading to Auckland's green water problem.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1972.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A fast mobility spectrometer for atmospheric ions</field><field name="creator">Brownlee, John Nevil</field><field name="description">The development of a mobility spectrometer which yields a complete spectrum every 25 seconds is described.

S. Byatt&#8217;s Fiction</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Frances (Frances Jennifer)</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the conceptualisation of subjectivity, the past and language in the work of one particular English novelist and critic, A. S. Byatt. In doing so, it examines significant points of overlap between Byatt's fiction and criticism, on the one hand, and, on the other, the discourses that have contributed to their formation. Whilst Byatt's work is inflected by recent critical examinations of the three concepts, this thesis is less concerned with how it reflects prevailing notions of subjectivity, the past and language, than with its participation in an ongoing examination of each. Although I do investigate the interplay between Byatt's fiction and criticism, my focus is on how this is played out in Byatt's fictional texts, in particular the novels. The Introduction offers a brief summary of other criticism on Byatt's work summarises the recent definitions of 'text' and broader discussions of postmodernism that have impacted on my approach to her fiction, and proposes a reading of these texts that accounts for their ambivalence. In Chapter One, I focus on the reconfiguration of subjectivity in Byatt's writing, particularly as it relates to textuality. Chapter Two explores the relationship between present and past in Byatt's fiction that is partly enacted through the texts' own engagement with past literatures, in particular nineteenth-century literature, and the related issues of historiography, linearity and memory that these texts investigate. Language, in particular Byatt's interest in its relation to 'things', is the focus of the third and final chapter of this thesis. Throughout each of the chapters is an exploration of Byatt's engagement or reexamination of a persistent 'thread of two' in Western discourse. Although each chapter focuses on one of the three concepts, each also explores the issues that arise from the conjunction of 'two things' in these fictions: text and subject, present and past, language and the world. Related to this is my consideration of how Byatt's fiction is characterised by a number of contradictory impetuses. Of particular interest is the ambivalence that arises from Byatt's partial engagement with recent critical theory - not only because it reflects larger cultural and discursive movements, but also because it contributes to a productive forging of new forms of fiction that combine an awareness of the concerns of literary and cultural criticism with a desire to evoke pleasure in the texts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2059</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors influencing antibody production in vitro</field><field name="creator">Finlay, Graeme John</field><field name="description">A. ANTIBODY RESPONSES OF HUMAN TONSILLAR LYMPHOCYTES. 1 Human tonsillar lymphocytes were stimulated with pokeweed mitogen in vitro. A large number of cells developed which secreted antibody specific for sheep erythrocytes. The largest number of antibody-forming cells was produced on days 4 or 5, when optimal cell concentrations were used. Responses specific for bovine and horse erythrocytes were much smaller than those specific for sheep erythrocytes. 2 Antibody responses were studied using a culture system which permits the segregation of individual clones of antibody-forming cells. As the number of cells in each culture was increased, the efficiency with which clones were produced and the mean clone size also increased. Cell dose-response data suggest that precursors of clones detected on day 4 are less dependent on cell co-operation than those giving rise to clones detected on day 5. The frequency of antibody-forming cell precursors at the peak of the response was estimated at 1.2 to 3.8 x 10-5. 3 The physical properties of antibody-forming cell precursors were investigated. When fractionated by sedimentation velocity, precursors appeared to be enriched in fractions of cells with a larger volume than the majority of lymphocytes. Precursors were heterogeneous when fractionated on the basis of their buoyant density. Little precursor activity was detected in cells with a density of greater than 1.075 g/ml. Cells able to generate antibody-forming cells were most enriched in fractions with a density of about 1.065g/ml. Cells which suppress responses are also found in fractions of this density. 4 Hydrocortisone succinate at 1&#956;g/ml (2&#956;M)enhanced the production of antibody-forming cells in many experiments. Hydrocortisone had to be present from the time that cultures were initiated in order to exert this effect. The effect of hydrocortisone upon cells which had been fractionated on the basis of their buoyant density was examined. It was able to potentiate the responses of two medium density fractions only, and actually suppressed the responses of high density cells. 5 Hydrocortisone enhanced an antibody response stimulated by sheep erythrocytes in a similar way as it enhanced PWM-stimulated responses. The addition of sheep erythrocytes to PWM-stimulated cultures enhanced PFC responses only in the presence of the hormone. These data are interpreted as showing that suppressor cell activity is selectively inhibited by hydrocortisone. B.

Spleen cells from normal and plasmacytoma-bearing mice were cultured and their antibody responses compared. In those instances where the production of antibody-forming cells was dependent upon helper T cells, it was found that the responses of cells from tumour-bearing mice were enhanced relative to controls. Thymus-independent responses were not enhanced. Evidence is presented that the nature of the effect of tumour growth upon antibody responsiveness is related to the culture system used.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cell Biology)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2060</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal growth in eggshells</field><field name="creator">Silyn-Roberts, Heather</field><field name="description">Preferred orientation in the eggshells of the crocodiles, turtles and birds is shown by X-ray diffractometry to develop throughout shell deposition. In all shells, the texture that develops is one in which the (001) plane of the unit cell tends to lie parallel to the shell surface. The degree of texture varies from being high in the calcite of the ratite and tinamou shells and the aragonite of the turtle shells to low in the calcite of the crocodilian and carinate shells. A model is proposed for the deposition of the entire eggshell. This model explains the observed textures and fracture morphologies of the shells. In each shell column, crystal deposition is initiated at a single location, from which growth fans out at all angles to the shell normal. In both calcitic and aragonitic shells, growth is in the [001] direction, resulting in an increase in the degree of (001) preferred orientation with distance from nucleation. Where there is unhindered crystal growth, the shells show a crystalline fracture morphology, and the degree of texture that develops is a simple function of the column radius. This type of growth makes up the whole of the turtle shell, the inner 0.3 to 0.4 of the thick ratite shells and the cone layer of the other avian shells. At the start of the central layer of the avian shell, the onset of protein deposition coincides with a hindrance to texture development, which thereafter proceeds at a lower rate. A further hindrance occurs about half-way through the shell, probably caused by a change in the physical characteristics of the protein network. The degree of texture that develops in the avian shell is a function of the column radius and the degree of physical hindrance presented by the protein network. The central layer of the avian shell has a composite fracture morphology resulting from the intermingling of the network with the inorganic phase. The organic component does not appear to control crystal growth as previously believed, but instead acts as a reinforcing fibrous network.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of some elimination and substitution reactions in a series of l-arylnaphthalene tetrachlorides</field><field name="creator">Bedford, Keith R. (Keith Richard), 1951-</field><field name="description">The heterolytic chlorination of 1-arylnaphthalene (aryl = 1(p-nitrophenyl), (p-chlorophenyl), 1-phenyl, and 1(p-methylphenyl) ) yields the appropriate 1-aryl-r-1,c-2,t-3,t-4-tetrachloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene as the major product of addition. The 1H n.m.r. spectra of these compounds show that there is no significant change in the conformation adopted in solution accompanying the change in the para-substituent. The major product of the alkaline dehydrochlorination of each of these tetrachlorides using sodium methoxide in methanol-acetone (80:20 v/v) or benzene-methanol (75:25 v/v) is the 1-aryl-2,3-dichloronaphthalene. The first stage of the reaction is rate-controlling and both stages appear to be bimolecular. The observed rate-coefficients have been dissected to derive rates for the two competing elimination processes involving either initial loss of the 4-chlorine and 3-hydrogen or of the 1-chlorine and 2-hydrogen. The value of the Hammett reaction constant for the first of these processes was found to be 0.60 in methanol-acetone and 0.85 in benzene-methanol. The corresponding values for the second process were found to be 1.48 and 1.58. Both these results indicate that the effect of substituents in stabilizing the incipient negative charge developing at the &#946; &#8211;carbon in the transition state is an important feature of the elimination processes involved. A slow, unimolecular solvolysis at the 1-chlorine has been observed with 1-Ph-NTC and 1(p-Me-Ph)NTC in methanol-acetone. It is proposed that the major product of this solvolysis results from the replacement of the 1-chlorine by a methoxy-group with retention of configuration. In contrast, the major product of solvolysis assisted by silver(I) ions is that possessing the inverted configuration. Alkaline dehydrochlorination of the methoxy-substituted compounds derived from 1(p-Me-Ph)NTC leads to fully aromatic products. This requires the elimination of the components of a molecule of methanol under comparatively mild alkaline conditions. Dehydrochlorination from the 1-arylnaphthalene tetrachlorides promoted by aluminium chloride in carbon disulphide at reflux temperature results in a mixture of the 1-aryl-2,3- and 2,4-dichloro- products. The proportion of 2,4-dichloro- product varies from 49% (1(p-NO2-Ph)NTC) to 65% (1-Ph-NTC).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2063</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of some reactions between electrophilic halogens and various conjugated systems in which intermediates or products having rearranged double-bond systems are concerned</field><field name="creator">Hannan, Brian Neil Bernard</field><field name="description">PART I A STUDY OF MECHANISTIC VARIATIONS IN THE BROMINATION AND CHLORINATION OF SOME ALKYL PHENOLS, PHENYL ETHERS AND PNENYL ESTERS. The brominations of some 2,6-dialkylphenyl acetates in nitro-methane and in acetic acid have been shown to give (a) products of substitution at both the C-3 and C-4 nuclear sites (b) products of substitution with rearrangement leading to the formation of various brominated alkylphenols and (c) uniquely in acetic acid, a product of alkyl side-chain substitution. The bromination of the corresponding benzoate derivatives realised only the products of 3- substitution. Various products of (a) substitution and (b) substitution with rearrangement were determined in the bromination of 3,4-dimethylphenyl acetate, phenyl acetate, and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl acetate. The bromination of 2,4,6-dimethylphenyl methyl ether gave only the expected product of nuclear substitution. Evidence for the likely involvement of addition-elimination sequences in the formation of products of substitution with rearrangement, has been adduced. The possible role of various other processes leading to the formation of deacylated products is discussed. The chlorination of 2,6-dimethylphenyl acetate, 2,6-dimethylphenyl benzoate and of 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenyl acetate in both acetic acid and nitromethane gave only the expected product of nuclear substitution. The reaction of chlorine with 3,4-dimethylphenol, its acetate and methyl ether in acetic acid led to the formation of certain enone and dienone adduct derivatives which could be shown to rearrange under the conditions of the reaction to give (a) in the case of the phenol-products of substitution and (b) for the acetate and methyl ether derivatives, products of substitution with rearrangement. The structures of the intermediates were determined from their spectral properties. Various mechanisms likely to be involved in processes of chloro-deacylation and of chloro-demethylation are discussed; a consideration of certain structural features of the substrates studied led to the conclusion that chloro-deacylation and chloro-demethylation were essentially processes initiated by ortho- attack of the chlorine molecule. PART II REACTION PATHS IN THE BROMINATION OF CHOLEST-4-EN-3-ONE, CHOLEST-5-EN-3-ONE AND 3-ACETOXYCHOLESTA-3,5-DIENE The bromination of cholest-4-en-3-one can occur by a number of reaction paths. Conditions have been established under which reaction can be established as occurring in part by electrophilic attack on (a) 3-hydroxycholesta-4,6-diene (b) 3-hydroxycholesta-2,4-diene or its anion and (c) cholest-4-en-3-one; among the products can be included 2&#945;-, 4-, 6&#946;-, and 6&#945;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one; 2&#945;,6&#946;-, 2&#945;,6&#945;-, and 4,6&#946;-dibromocholest-4-en-3-one; and 2&#945;,4,6&#946;-tribromocholest-4-en-3-one. Unstable adducts involving the 4,5-double bond are implicated in a number of cases. The bromination of cholest-5-en-3-one is equally complicated, and can involve addition to the 5,6-double bond. Knowledge of the range of conditions and reagents through which 3-acetoxycholesta-3,5-diene is brominated to give 6&#946;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one has been extended. Intermediate adducts involving the 5,6-double bond have been shown to be components of the reaction mixture from the acetoxydiene and bromine in acetic acid. Acid catalysed isomerisation and rearrangements of the kinetically controlled products, and dibromination, can be controlled by selective choice of the conditions of bromination and work-up. Complications associated with the reaction paths have been partly elucidated. The rates and mechanism of reversible isomerisation of 6&#946;- to 6&#945;-bromocholest-4-en-3-one, and of 2&#945;,&#946;- to 2&#945;,6&#945;-dibromocholest-4-en-3-one, have been studied and a proposed mechanism is outlined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2064</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cooperative learning in preschool settings: enhancing the social integration of young children with disabilities</field><field name="creator">Boyd, Andrea</field><field name="description">An examination was made of the effectiveness of cooperative learning as a strategy for enhancing the social acceptance of preschool children with disabilities who had been included in a mainstream educational setting. Preschool groups accommodating children with special needs were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions - cooperative play and social skills training, social skills training on1y, or control (no intervention). Children in the cooperative play programme received significantly higher levels of social acceptance than did those in the social-skills or regular preschool programmes. Moreover, the cooperative play group showed significantly more positive and more frequent social interactions with nondisabled peers than did the children in the other groups. It was also found that following the intervention the children in both the cooperative and social-skills treatment groups were rated significantly higher than were those in the control group on social skills and social play posttest measures. The results thus indicate that the use of structured cooperative play yielded an incremental effect over social-skills training in furthering the social integration of preschool children with disabilities in mainstream settings. The finding that increased social acceptance occurs in situations where social-skills training is undertaken within a framework of structured cooperative play was discussed terms of its implications for the social inclusion of young children with disabilities in integrated educational settings. It was noted that if participation in mainstream preschool settings is to be of real value for young children with disabilities, programmes designed to maximize social acceptance, such as structured cooperative play and social-skills training, need to be utilized to facilitate social interaction. Indeed, in the absence of strategies to enhance social integration, the placement of young children with disabilities in mainstream educational settings may well place such children at risk with respect to their social development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies::330101 Educational psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The interaction of copper(II) with ligands containing nitrogen and sulphur donors</field><field name="creator">Braithwaite, Andrew Castley</field><field name="description">A study of the influence of several "soft donor" ligands on the cupric ion has been completed. Nitrogen and sulphur donors were chosen since these are considered to be present in "biological copper" situations, some of the conditions of which it was hoped to duplicate. Complicated reactions were found with several different types of ligands. Those containing imine functions, when complexed to copper(II), were invariably found to cleave due to the presence of external nucleophiles and it was considered that for such donors to be important in "biological" situations they would need to be shielded by bulky ligand systems. The cleavage reactions were found to have their origin in electronic mechanisms and earlier suggestions based on steric interactions were criticised. A study of sulphur donors showed that, whereas thioethers had a poor affinity for copper(II), thiols bonded very strongly. Reduction to copper(I) invariably took place, but with ligands containing TT-delocalised aromatic thiols as well as amine donors mixed-valent complexes of copper were formed. The properties of most of these complexes were unusual and one, especially, (N-(2-thiophenol) pyridine-2-aldiminato)copper(II) chloride, showed reactions and properties that suggested it may be a suitable model for cupro-enzymes. Complexes with thiol donors were termed "anomalous" in view of their complicated physical properties, whereas compounds with other donors showed "normal" behaviour. Absorption spectral studies were undertaken in an attempt to understand the electronic states of the "soft donor" complexes; at the same time an assessment of a recent scheme for assigning stereochemistries from visible spectra as applied to "soft donor" systems was possible. An X-ray structural determination of the complex &#956;-chloro-chlorobis(3,4-bis(3-amino-1-thiapropyl)toluene)dicopper(II) diperchlorate was undertaken, partly because of its unusual synthetic and physical characteristics. Two copper centres, one five- and the other six-co-ordinate, were found to be linked by a bridging chloride ion. The geometries about each copper ion were considerably distorted from square-pyramidal and octahedral respectively; the ligand systems also showed unusual electronic effects. Comparison with other recent structural investigations suggested that five-co-ordination is favoured by the copper ion in "soft donor" environments, and this was thought to be significant in terms of oxygen-carrying ability, where an increase in co-ordination number must occur. Several attempts to oxygenate prepared complexes were made, but no conclusive results were obtained, although several somewhat unstable crystalline products were produced.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1972.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2066</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluorocarbene complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Hoskins, S. V.</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the synthesis and properties of fluorocarbene complexes of ruthenium and osmium. Chapter 1 is a review of transition metal CF3-complexes and illustrates a number of unusual features of these compounds which makes them suitable for modification into CF2-complexes. To place the fluorocarbene complexes into context, Chapter 2 contains a brief review of transition metal carbene complexes with the emphasis on other halocarbene species. As described in Chapter 3, CF3-complexes of ruthenium can be prepared by the addition of Hg(CF3)2 to Ru(CO)3(PPh3)2. The x-ray crystal structure of Ru(HgCF3)(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 shows longer C-F bonds in the ruthenium bound CF3-group than in the mercury bound CF3-group. Reactions of fluorocarbon complexes with Lewis acids have been explored and RuCl(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with BCl3 to form the known RuCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2. Similarly OsCl(CF2H)(CO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with one equivalent of BCl3 to form initially a cationic carbene complex in which the carbene carbon atom substitutes first into a benzene ring of one PPh3-ligand and, through further reaction with BCl3, into a ring of the second PPh3-ligand. The x-ray crystal structures of OsCl(CO)2(PPh2C6H4CHCl)PPh3 and OsCl(CO)2(PPh2C6H4CH)(PPh2C6H4) are reported. RuCl(CF3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 in many of its reactions behaves as a CF2-complex precursor and Chapter 4 describes the reaction between the related RuCl(CF3)(CH3CN)(CO)(PPh3)2 and Me3SiCl to form the first isolable CF2-complex, RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2. RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 contains an electrophilic carbene ligand and reacts rapidly with hard, oxygen and nitrogen containing nucleophiles. A comparison of the reactivity of RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 and RuCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is presented and reasons for the differing reactivities proposed. Chapter 5 shows that d8 CF2-complexes can be prepared directly from reaction between the more active CF3-transfer reagent, Cd(CF3)2-glyme, and various zerovalent complexes. The x-ray crystal structures of M(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os and OsCl(NO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 are described and the bonding characteristics of the CF2-ligand discussed. The carbene ligand of M(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os has some nucleophilic character and reacts readily with electrophiles, for example reaction with HC1 yields MCl(CF2H)(CO)2(PPh3)2 M = Ru, Os. A comparison between RuCl2(CO)(CF2)(PPh3)2 and Ru(CO)2(CF2)(PPh3)2 reveals that the reactivity of the carbene ligand is controlled by the electron density at the metal centre, i.e. is oxidation state dependent.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2067</field></doc><doc><field name="title">William Carlos Williams: A Study of his Work</field><field name="creator">Doyle, Charles</field><field name="description">This study is twofold in purpose: (1) to examine the full range of William's writing, a task which has not been undertaken by anyone since Vivienne Koch in 1950.

(previously treated under &#8216;P. comans&#8217; or P.endlicheriana Agardh) both Norfolk Is. endemics, and the taxonomy of P. sp.aff.comans LHI (previously &#8216;P. comans&#8217;) endemic to Lord Howe Island is also discussed. Detailed study of the spores and paleae using conventional light microscopy and SEM was made for these species and also P. comans Forst. f. (from the New Hebrides) and P. novae-caledoniae from New Caledonia. Comparisons of the distribution, fronds, stipes, venation, rhizomes, paleae, indumentum, apices, sori, sporangia and spores have been made and where appropriate material of P. dentata ssp. flabellata, P. pacifica and P. vittata, has also been compared. Further comparisons have been made with material of &#8216;P. comans&#8217; from other Pacific Islands including Fiji (three species ), Rarotonga, Samoa, Tahiti (each one species). P. tremula, P. kingiana and P. novae-caledoniae are exceptional in the genus because they lack paraphyses in the sori. P. kingiana and P. novae-caledoniae have a copious waxy deposit around and among the sporangial stalks but P. tremula has no accessory sporangial features at all. Germination and gametophyte growth follow the normal pattern for the genus. Some gametophytes can be kept alive and growing for considerable periods (up to three years) and become elongate, ribbon-like and unisexual (female). Hybridisation was achieved between P. carsei and P. macilenta.

Initially, L-Trp, D-Trp, IPyA, TNH2 and IAA were purified from shoots, identified by full-scan mass spectrometry and their concentrations measured using gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. High specific activity [5-3H]IAOX and [5-3H]IPyA were synthesized from L-[5-3H]Trp and used as internal standards. Purification of endogenous IPyA was enabled by forming a stable pentafluorobenzyl oxime derivative in the crude plant extract. The respective endogenous concentrations of L-Trp, D-Trp, TNH2, IPyA and IAA were found to be 2,520, 103, 146.3, 5.9 and 8.5 ng g-1 f. wt. However, IAOX could not be identified as a natural constituent of tomato shoots by full-scan GC-MS. Secondly, incubation of tomato shoots for 6, 10 and 21 h in 30% 2H2O was used as a means of labelling IAA and its putative precursors in vivo. L-Trp, D-Trp, TNH2, IPyA and IAA were then extracted and purified and the 2H content measured by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. These indole compounds were labelled rapidly with up to four 2H atoms. Direct comparison of the number and the amount of 2H atoms incorporated (pattern) was obtained from the mass spectral data on the common m/z 130 ion and its isotope peaks. IAA and L-Trp demonstrated an increase in 2H label with up to 17% and 21% of their molecules labelled at 10 h respectively. This was followed by a significant decrease in 2H label at 21 h to 12% for both L-Trp and IAA. This decrease in 2H label was attributed to an increase in protein catabolism, following shoot excision, resulting in the dilution of free L-Trp pool(s) with unlabelled L-Trp from which IAA is biosynthesized. This is reflected in the observed 1.6 to 1.8 fold increase of free L-Trp from 10 to 21 h. In contrast, tryptamine demonstrated a continual increase in 2H label with an average of 8, 20 and 28% of the molecules labelled at 6, 10 and 21 h respectively, suggesting that TNH2 and IAA were synthesized from separate Trp pools. In addition, the relatively slow rate at which 2H is incorporated into tryptamine would not be sufficient to account for the rate at which IAA becomes labelled. However, IPyA demonstrated a rapid increase in 2H with 22% and 37% of its molecules labelled at 6 and 10 h respectively. From the rate at which IPyA was labelled with 2H and the concentration of IPyA in tomato shoots a rate of synthesis for IPyA in tomato shoots was estimated which was sufficient to provide most of the shoot IAA requirements. Furthermore, the extent to which IAA and IPyA were labelled relative to that of total L-Trp would imply that a smaller more rapidly metabolised pool(s) of L-Trp was the precursor of these compounds. The rate and extent that D-Trp was labelled was consistently less than that of IAA precluding it as a possible precursor of IAA. These results indicate that in tomato shoots IAA is biosynthesized from a rapidly metabolized sub-pool(s) of L-trptophan predominantly via IPyA.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270101 Analytical biochemistry</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Routes to drimanes from podocarpic acid</field><field name="creator">Grimsdale, Andrew Clive</field><field name="description">The synthesis and ozonolysis of the 6- and 7-substituted 12-hydroxypodocarpatrienes (26), (86), (90), and (98), as a possible route for the synthesis of drimanes from 12-hydroxypodocarpa-8,11,13-trien-19-oic acid (podocarpic acid) (9) has been investigated.

The shorter of the two intervals comprising the mixed-interval schedules was always 5 sec, the longer was either 10 sec, 20 sec, 40 sec, or 60 sec. The number of times each of the two intervals occurred in these mixed-interval schedules was varied.

It was also suggested that the way in which Davison and Temple's predictions differed from the obtained preference ratios was the result of a weighting of the intervals in the MI schedules that changed according to the particular choice arranged.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2073</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The submerged vegetation of Lake Rotoma</field><field name="creator">Clayton, John Sinclair</field><field name="description">The Majority of Rotorua Lakes are rapidly becoming eutrophic and/or dominated by exotic hydrophytes. Lake Rotoma was studied to provide essential information on native aquatic hydrophytes within an oligotrophic lake, and to record the initial transition towards an exotic dominated community. The lake is of volcanic origin and has a markedly fluctuating water level because of the absence of a surface outlet. An underwater SCUBA investigation was made in 1972, followed by intensive sampling from 50 systematically located one transects in 1973. A suitable quadrat size and shape was selected and the sampling error was assessed. The species frequencies were calculated from presence or absence recordings. Quadrat cover, depth, gradient and substrate were also determined. Three characean species, Chara fibrosa f. acanthopitys. (A. Br.) R.D.W., Nitella leptostachys var. leonhardii (R.D.W.) R.D.W. and N.pseudoflabellata var. mucosa (Nordst.) Bailey, dominated the vegetation. The next most common pattern contained the same three species plus Lagarosiphon major (Ridley) Moss. The initial stages of L.major invasion in to a characean community was recorded from 1973 up to 1976. The charophytes ranged in depth from 0 - 17.5m and were located upon a wide variety of substrates and gradients. The native vascular plants were absent from many transects. The plants had a depth range from 0 - 4.5m with most occurring above 3.5m. The Low Mixed Community was primarily located in water less than 1.25ma at the N.E. end of the lake, which resulted in this area having a high species diversity. The exotic hydrophytes were more widespread and abundant than the native vascular phanerogams. The distribution of L.major and Elodea canadensis Michx. appeared to coincide with boating access, recreational usage and fallen submerged trees. The depth range was 0 - 6.0m, although the available habitats within this range have not yet been fully exploited. Emergent species were abundant within the S.W. inlet and also in the lagoons around the lake shoreline where sheltered conditions and shallow gradients prevail. An experimental study on the effect of erosion and sedimentation by removing the shallow water plant cover, showed that the presence of plants moderated the extent of erosion and also encouraged sedimentation. Recolonisation of cleared areas was discussed. Annual frequency changes in the vascular hydrophytes were largely influenced by water level fluctuations and by the extension of exotic species. Water-level fluctuations were observed to influence (a) the bottom limit of plant growth (probably indirectly through light penetration), (b) the upper limit of plant growth by determining available growing space, and (c) the rate of spread of exotic species by erosion and redistribution of existing stands. The 1973 raw data was processed and standardised in the form of species presence or absence, absolute frequency, and relative frequency within each transect. Distance matrices were constructed using non-Euclidean distance functions. A non-linear multidimensional scaling technique was used to construct transect and species ordinations. The advantages and problems associated with this technique are discussed and compared to alternative methods. That adopted was successfully tested for its ability to reconstruct a place map of the North Island of New Zealand. The configuration error was calculated for each ordination and was found to be less than for the alternative methods tested. From the first species ordination a concept of species prosperity was developed which involved the number of transects and quadrats within which each species was recorded, and the maximum depth recording for each species. Non-linear analysis indicated that average gradient might be a significant influence. From the first transect ordination, four vegetation groups were recognised and discussed. Depth, substrate, species dominance and gradient were significant within the ordinations. Non-linear analysis confirmed many of the previous interpretations of the ordinations but gave no further information.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2074</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Ecology of the possum (Trichosurus Vulpecula Kerr) in Pinus radiata plantations</field><field name="creator">Clout, M. N. (Michael Norman), 1950-</field><field name="description">Damage caused by possums (Trichosurus vulpecula Kerr) in New Zealand's extensive Pinus radiata plantations has caused concern among foresters. This study set out to examine the nature of tire problem and investigate the ecology of possums in radiata plantations in relation to damage and control. The work was carried out in the Kinleith Forest near Tokoroa in the central North Island. A review of existing literature and survey results showed that damage is mainly a problem of young plantations, consisting of bark-stripping on young trees and browsing of newly-planted seedlings. A simulated browsing experiment indicated that the latter damage was unlikely to result in discernible production losses. Bark-stripping was found to occur during the winter and spring. It had a patchy distribution and was only thought likely to prove serious where stocking was already low for other reasons. Analysis of stomach contents from animals poisoned in 1971 plantings and 1960 age class stands revealed that in both habitats possums relied heavily on foods other than pine, although in the older (1960) stands radiata pollen cones were an important winter and spring food. Insect larvae (Philia nigrostigma) were also eaten at this time of year, particularly in older stands. Little bark was consumed in either habitat, but it was a more common food in the younger stands, were it was eaten during the winter and spring. It is suggested that bark-stripping in young stands may be a response to relatively poor nutrition during the winter and early spring. Data on fat reserves, reproductive performance and growth support the view that the overall plane of nutrition was better among possums in the older stands. Possum populations were studied by livetrapping and radiotelemetry in two areas, one within a 1960 age class radiata stand (FRSA), the other extending across the boundary between a 1971 planting and cutover native forest (MSA). In the latter area there was a seasonal pattern of habitat use, with animals tending to use the native forest to a greater extent than the plantation during the winter. Population densities were similar in the two areas (2-3/ ha), with the MSA population having an apparent trend of increase. The two populations differed in composition, the FRSA one having an excess of females and the MSA an initial excess of males but an increasing proportion of females. It is suggested that disturbance of the MSA population, by burning in 1971 and subsequent poisoning, resulted in partial depopulation with initial recolonisation predominantly by dispersing males. Results from both study areas showed that young males have a greater tendency to disperse from their native area than do young females. Radiotelemetry revealed that possums in the MSA used more dens than those in the FRSA and good dens appeared to be few in the latter area. It is suggested that dens may be a limiting resource for some possum populations. Since females are known to control the use of dens the survival of males should be poorer where dens are limited, resulting ultimately in a biased sex ratio. Experimental depopulation of the FRSA and monitoring of its recolonisation over one year suggested that population re-establishment on cleared areas does not depend on local reproduction by survivors, but is primarily by dispersal in the initial stages, with an early influx of young males. The MSA population was also poisoned, in a standard 1080 airdrop, and the effectiveness of this operation was monitored. Current control practices are critically appraised in the light of the results obtained in this study and the value of widespread aerial poisoning operations in pine plantation habitats is questioned.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sources of variance in the detection of auditory signals with special reference to unstable decision criteria</field><field name="creator">Bridgman, Geoff, 1946-</field><field name="description">Data from twelve auditory signal detection experiments show that a model general to all signal detection tasks explains results better than specific auditory models. This thesis examines models of the detection of sinusoids in Gaussian white noise, all predicting linear ROC-curves on normal-normal co-ordinates, but differing in their predictions for the ROC-curve slope. Distinction is made between stimulus distributions, transducer distributions and response-inferred distributions. Response-inferred distributions include variance from stimuli, transducers and unstable criteria. The first three experiments (rating) showed that slope increases with increases in p(sn) and in the number of categories available for describing the presence of the signal. An explanation for this data assumes that the 'yes-no' criterion has the least variance and other criteria have variances proportional to their distances from the 'yes-no' criterion. This explanation is developed into a model of selective attention in which the variance of all real criteria is a function of their distances from an optimal criterion. Faulty memory is the assumed cause of criterion variance. Predictions that follow from the model are (i) there is a decline in criterion variance as signal strength increases ; (ii) there is a U- (or inverted U-) shaped function relating slope and signal strength; (iii) criterion variance is less in forced-choice tasks than in 'yes-no' tasks; and (iv) slope is partially determined by task design and any other factor which affects the subject's memory for signal or noise. Experiments 4-6 establish that the concept of criterion variance also applies to yes-no procedures, and Experiments 7-11 substantiate predictions made by the model of selective attention. Data from Experiments 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 are analysed in terms of models of sinusoidal burst and gap detection. None of the probabilistic models is adequate, but Zwislocki's (1969) deterministic model of temporal summation accounts for the data. A model of response-inferred distributions is presented in which the mathematical relationships of the variances and locations of criteria, of signal strength and of stimulus variances to the slope of the ROC-curve are described. Equations for the optimal criterion, the variance of individual criteria and a measure of sensitivity uncontaminated by criterion variance are derived. Re-analysis of data using the model of response-inferred distributions supports the predictions of the model of selective attention. The model of response-inferred distributions predicts 'peaked' rating ROC-curves which are similar to two-state functions and commonly observed in the literature. However, both two-state and high-threshold theories are unable to explain the data. Experiment 12 compares the model of response-inferred distributions with Pike's (1973) multiple observations model for latency data and finds the latter model inferior. Criterion variance is shown to account fox at least half of the variance of the response-inferred distributions, and consequently, it is argued that TSD results should be viewed more in terms of the general processes which produce criterion variance than modality-specific models of signal processing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proton polarization in the 3He(d,p)4He reaction</field><field name="creator">Clare, John Frederick</field><field name="description">The proton polarization in the 3He(d,p)4He reaction induced by unpolarized deuterons has been measured at deuteron lab. energies of 2.0, 2.8, 3.9 and 6.0MeV for 20 angles between 0&#176; and 150&#176; (c.m.). Statistical uncertainties are typically &#177; 0.01. The measurements were made with a proton polarimeter in which the left-right asymmetry of scattering at 60&#176; (lab.) in 4He is determined. The polarimeter employs "venetian-blind" collimation of the protons by conical vanes and 75 cm2 plastic scintillator detectors. Four detectors are included for use in polarization transfer experiments. For 10.5 MeV protons and a helium pressure of 250 p.s.i. the target thickness is 3 MeV and the efficiency per detector per unpolarized proton incident is 10-4. For each polarimeter detector a triple coincidence with a 15 ns resolving time was required with two scintillator transmission detectors preceding the polarimeter. Spectra of random coincidences were accumulated simultaneously and subtracted. Asymmetries resulting from polarimeter-target misalignment and other geometrical effects are discussed. All results quoted are geometric means of pairs of measurements for 180&#176; rotation of the polarimeter and are also arithmetic means of such measurements to left and right of the 3He target. The absolute analyzing power is estimated by computer simulation of trajectories to be -0.638 &#177; 0.020 for protons entering at 10.3 MeV. The product of polarization and cross section is fitted to an expansion of first-order associated Legendre polynomials using these results and earlier measurements. Only four terms are required except at 6.0MeV where a fifth is necessary. The energy dependence of these coefficients suggests resonances in 5Li at deuteron energies of 60MeV (odd coefficients) and 7.5 MeV (even coefficients) in agreement with results for the polarized-beam analyzing powers(1). Comparison of the results with vector-polarized-beam (1) and polarized-target(2) analyzing powers shows no evidence for the postulated simple relations(3) based on DWBA cal calculations. Comparison of the results with recent measurements of the neutron polarization in the mirror reaction(4) shows no significant differences. The theory of angular correlations in charged particle reactions is developed and used to calculate outgoing nucleon polarizations. Expressions are given for polarization transfer coefficients. These coefficients are evaluated in terms of the T-matrix elements for the interference of various channels with the dominant S-wave, J&#928; = 3+/2 channel in 3He(d,p)4He at the 0.43 MeV resonance. Two experiments to measure combinations of these elements are discussed. (1) Gruebler, W. et al., 1971, Nucl. Phys. Al76, 631 (2) Leemann, Ch., W.

The author spent fifteen months in the field, spread over three fieldtrips between 1975.and 1978. Welfare Society members in Hahalis Village shared with the author the work of their hands so that she could appreciate the significance of the ground, and the work of their hearts so that she could feel the compassion, love, and positive exuberance that informed their thinking &#8211; thus enabling her to understand in some measure the analysis, critique and transformation of Buka culture and society in which they were engaged. The first chapter of this thesis elaborates the relationship between Hahalis Welfare Society and its historical, and contemporary social/political context on Buka. There is also a discussion of the author's approach to fieldwork on Buka &#8211;both in terms of theory and practice. The second chapter explores the nature of traditional power and leadership which remain central to the philosophy and organization of the Welfare Society. The special importance of matrilineal principles and the brother-sister relationship are explored, as are forms of alliance between lineages and moieties. The qualities of balance and restraint inherent in the Buka concepts of power and leadership are shown to be under some strain in the contemporary political and economic context. Chapter Three discusses ritual occasions in relation to the issues raised in the preceding chapter. Ritual is seen as a creative re-thinking of the nature of power, and personal and social relationships &#8211; a complex weave that reflects the past, the present, and possible future designs. Chapter Four centres more directly on the role of women in Welfare Society and their past and present active participation in the development of its philosophy and its practice. The final chapter explores three issues drawn from the author's fieldwork experience which are discussed in terms of their relevance to Hahalis Welfare Society, and the development of anthropological practice. These issues centre on the subjective stance in anthropological fieldwork, the debate over fertility and family planning, and the problematic interpretation of sacrifice.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">For God or Man: Notions of Women in Seventeenth Century England</field><field name="creator">McCrystal, John</field><field name="description">This study argues that 'new' ways of speaking about the nature and status of women are evident in the literary record of late seventeenth century England, particularly in the writings of Mary Astell (1666-1731). Writing to oppose the natural rights-based political theory of the 'Father of Modern Liberalism', John Locke, Astell employed the secular, rationalist, individualistic language which Locke himself used to argue the equal human dignity of women with men. Hers was the first unequivocal plea made by an English writer. The subject of this study is the provenance of these new modes of thinking about women. The result of a survey of primary sources, dating primarily from the period 1600-1700, it first seeks to show that seventeenth century England inherited a 'traditional' notion of women and their status from antiquity; scriptural, philosophical and empirical evidence of women's moral and intellectual equality with men coexisted uneasily with the consensual notion that they were men's subordinates. This notion survived the Continental and English Reformations to be incorporated into the theology of both the Church of England and the Puritans alike. Thinking and writing about women took place in the context of an 'ideology of order', wherein individuals were considered solely in relation to society and in terms of their obligations and status. It is then argued that the paradox of women's equal humanity and subordinate status first received serious interrogation during the political crises of 1640-1660. Radical Protestants, who placed the individual believer - male or female - at the centre of religious life, allowed women to participate to an unprecedented degree in worship. The potential of radical Protestantism to challenge the traditional subordination of women was obvious in the political theory of the 'Levellers', who secularised religious individualism to produce a programme of democratic reform. The invisibility of women in this proto-liberal programme is given special attention here. The paradox inherent in the traditional notion of woman was thrown into sharp relief, furthermore, in the course of the political debates between royalists and parliamentarians during the Civil War; both sides attempted to liken the relationship between king and people to that between husband and wife. The marriage analogue served to highlight the gap which was opening between political analysis and the justifications for the subordination for women. Finally, it is argued that renewed political crisis in the last two decades of the century saw the introduction of secular individualism to English political thought, reinforced with the 'new' metaphysics of Descartes. John Locke considered that since individuals constructed society for their own ends, they could resist government where these were not being served. Yet as Astell pointed out, Locke fell back upon the traditional assumption that women ought to be subordinated in this society to men. She adopted the new metaphysics to show not only that Locke's political conclusions were wrong and dangerous, but also to show that women, their subordinate social status notwithstanding, were of equal dignity and worth to men.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political studies)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2083</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural studies of metal-ribonucleotide complexes</field><field name="creator">Orbell, John Donald</field><field name="description">The crystal and molecular structures of five binary complexes between transition-metal ions and 5'-ribonucleotides have been determined by X-ray crystallographic means.

It has been found that the yields of benzobisbenzofuranquinonoid (1) derivatives are greater when after initial nucleophilic attack on the ketoenoid system by the oxygen atom of the phenoxide ion, the carbon atom ortho to the vinyl-aryl ether linkage is activated towards further nucleophilic attack by the presence of a suitably orientated electron releasing substituent. The other products of the reaction mixture have been isolated and characterised, and the spectral data discussed for the derivatives of 2,3-diethoxydi-benzofuran-1,4-quinone which were obtained in this way. The mass spectra of benzobisbenzofuranquinones and the corresponding quinol acetates have been examined. Facile loss methyl radicals from aromatic methoxy groups and ketene from the acetate derivatives was observed. Decarbonylation and fragmentation involving the heterocyclic ring system resulted in peaks of only minor intensity. The ready loss of substituents as described above is explained by the resulting formation of resonance stabilized quinonoid ions. Some chemical constituents of Peniophora gigantea have been isolated and characterised. 2',3',6'-Trimethoxy-p-terphenyl (25) was obtained which represents the first methoxylated p-terphenyl isolated from a fungus. Also obtained was a mixture comprising two compounds, C30H48 and C30H50. On mass spectral grounds these are proposed to be the pentacyclic triterpenes, lupa-15,19(22)-diene (33) and lup-19(22)-ene (34) respectively. 14,15-Epoxy-2-ketomanoyl oxide (44) has been microbiologically hydroxylated by Calonectria decora to form 1&#946;,7&#945;-dihydroxy-14,15-epoxy-2-ketomanoyl oxide (45). The positions of the hydroxyl groups were determined from the peaks arising from fragmentations in rings A and B in the mass spectrum. Strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding observed in the i.r. spectrum supported the equatorial conformation of the hydroxy group at Cl whilst the facile loss of water upon electron impact and the presence of a signal corresponding to an equatorial carbinol proton in the n.m.r. infers that at C7 is axial. Finally, it has been proposed that the structures of the blue pigments, corticins A and B, isolated from Corticium caeruleum by Dean are 2,6,9-trihydroxy-3,8,12-trimethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']bisbenzofuran and 2,3,8,9-tetramethoxybenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b']bisbenzofuran-6,12-dione respectively.

They are: Dorcadospyris mahurangi (Trissocyclidae), Dictyoprora gibsoni, Siphocampe missilis, Spirocyrtis proboscis (Artostrobiidae), Anthocyrtidium odontatum, Lamprocyclas matakohe (Pterocorythidae), Phormocyrtis vasculum (Theoperidae). Chapter Three &#8211; New Radiolaria from the Oligocene and Early Miocene of Northland, New Zealand Abstract: Thirteen new radiolarian species, two new genera and one new combination from the Oligocene and early Miocene of Northland, New Zealand, are formally described - The species are &#8211; Heliodiscus tunicatus (Phacodiscidae), Rhopalastrum tritelum (spongodiscidae), Lithomelissa gelasinus, L. maureenae, Lophophaena tekopua (Plagiacanthidae), Valkyria pukapuka (Sethoconidae), Cyrtocapsa osculum, Lophocyrtis (Paralampterium)? inaequalis, Lychnocanium neptunei, Stichocorys negripontensis, Theocorys bianulus, T. perforalvus, T. puriri (Theoperidae); the genera are &#8211; Plannapus (Artostrobiidae) and Valkyria (Sethoconidae); the combination is Plannapus microcephalus (Artostrobiidae). Standardised terminology is proposed for internal skeletal elements and external appendages. Emendations are proposed for the family Artostrobiidae and the genera Heliodiscus, Lithomelissa and Cyrtocapsa. Heliodiscus, Cyrtocapsa and Lychnocanium are established as senior synonyms of Astrophacus, Cyrtocapsella and Lychnocanoma respectively. Chapter Four &#8211; Early Miocene Radiolaria from Te Kopua Point, Kaipara Harbour, New Zealand Abstract: Radiolaria from the Early Miocene Puriri Formation at Te Kopua Point in the Kaipara area, Northland, New Zealand are documented. Six new species are described - Spongotrochus antoniae (Spongodiscidae), Botryostrobus hollisi, Siphocampe grantmackiei, (Artostrobiidae), Carpocanium rubyae (Carpocaniidae), Anthocyrtidium marieae (Pterocorythidae) and Phormocyrtis alexandrae (Theoperidae). Carpocanium is established as the senior synonym of Carpocanistrum. Chapter Five &#8211; Radiolaria from the Oamaru Diatomite, South Island, New Zealand Abstract: Radiolaria from the world-famous Oamaru Diatomite are documented with 24 new species described and three new genera erected The new species are Tricorporisphaera bibula, Zealithapium oamaru (Actionommidae), Plectodiscus runanganus (Porodiscidae), Plannapus hornibrooki, P. mauricei, Spirocyrtis greeni (Artostrobiidae), Botryocella pauciperforata (Cannobotryidae), Carpocanopsis ballisticum (Carpocaniidae), Verutotholus doigi, V. edwardsi, V. mackayi (Neosciadiocapsidae), Lithomelissa lautouri, Velicucullus fragilis (Plagoniidae), Lamprocyclas particollis (Pterocorythidae), Artophormis fluminafauces, Eucyrtidium ventriosum, Eurystomoskevos cauleti, Lophocyrtis (L.) haywardi, Lychnocanium alma, L. waiareka, L. waitaki, Pterosyringium hamata, Sethochytris cavipodis and Thyrsocyrtis (T.?) pingusicoides (Theoperidae). The new genera are Tricorporisphaera, Zealithapium (Actinommidae), and Verutotholus (Neosciadiocapsidae). Emendations are proposed to the family Neosciadiocapsidae and the genus Eurystomoskevos, and Pterosyringium is raised from subgeneric to generic level. Radiolarian faunal composition confirms a Late Eocene age for the Oamaru Diatomite. Chapter Six &#8211; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy: A New Technique for Investigating and Illustrating Fossil Radiolaria Abstract: Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), a technique newly applied to the study of fossil Radiolaria, offers the radiolarist clear views of single optical planes of specimens, unhindered by many of the optical effects of conventional light microscopy, while obviating the need to section or break specimens. Resulting images are of a clarity unsurpassed by conventional light microscopy and, as they are saved on computer, are easily viewed, manipulated, enhanced, measured and converted to hard copy. Used in conjunction with common radiolarian study methods CLSM is a powerful tool for gaining additional information with relatively little extra effort. Chapter Seven conveniently summarises taxonomic, stratigraphic and geographic data of all new taxa described, incorporating information gained from the studies and relevant literature. Appendices present the following: data pertaining to all illustrated specimens in this thesis from the University of Auckland Catalogue of Type and Figured Specimens; distribution of Radiolaria at Te Kopua Point; distribution of species and a species list for the Mahurangi Limestone.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2092</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mosaic: a study of juxtaposition in literature, as an approach to Pound's Cantos and similar modern poems</field><field name="creator">Horrocks, Roger</field><field name="description">The principles of form in &#8216;mosaic&#8217; poems such as The Cantos, Paterson, Maximus, or even &#8216;The Waste Land,&#8217; are not yet clearly understood. Criticism needs to bring its various ideas of &#8216;musical form,&#8217; &#8216;non-linear form,&#8217; or &#8216;the poem as a field of forces&#8217; into sharper focus. Mosaic poems are characterized by sudden changes of direction, heightened contrasts of style and texture, a complex use of quotation, and strange effects of fluidity where the usual distinction between the &#8216;tenor&#8217; and &#8216;vehicle&#8217; of metaphors is dissolved. To decide what features (if any) of the modern mosaic poem are new, the thesis examines possible precedents: so-called &#8216;pre-logical&#8217; poetry, the associationism of Romantic poetry, Leaves of Grass, Rimbaud&#8217;s poems, Mallarm&#233;&#8217;s Un coup de d&#233;s, etc. the work of European avant-garde poets of the 1910s (Apollinaire, Cendrars, Marinetti, et al.) is considered in detail, and the supposed originality of Pound and Eliot&#8217;s poetry is somewhat diminished when it is viewed against this European background. Nevertheless Pound and Eliot do contribute some technical innovations, particularly in the way their poetry combines &#8216;hard&#8217; and &#8216;soft&#8217; textures (to use Pound&#8217;s terms). The thesis examines Pound&#8217;s special &#8216;breakthrough&#8217; in 1919, and also the close interaction between his work and Eliot&#8217;s during this period &#8211; the two men advancing &#8216;like mountaineers roped together.' Mosaic poems demand a new style of &#8216;reading by field.&#8217; Criticism needs to develop ways of talking about the experience of discontinuity as sensitively as it now deals with continuity. Approaches to The Cantos that emphasize &#8216;ideogrammic logic&#8217; tend to be over-intellectual and not able to deal adequately with the more fluid or discontinuous aspects of the poem. The thesis explores the procedures of mosaic poetry, its various styles of &#8216;jumping&#8217; (to use Robert Bly&#8217;s term), ways of using fragments evocatively, and ways in which gaps or silences in a poem can be charged with meaning. Since collage is an important feature of mosaic poetry, the thesis attempts to survey this development historically, distinguishing it in some respects from traditional styles of quotation and allusion. The mosaic poem is compared and contrasted with earlier types of poem-sequence. The doubts expressed by Eliot, Tate, and other critics about the coherence of the modern long poem are answered by such essays as &#8216;Dr Williams&#8217; Position&#8217; in which Pound proposes new ideas of order. But Pound&#8217;s poetic practice was still more subtle than his theory, a discrepancy also noted in Eliot&#8217;s work. The thesis looks cautiously at the analogy often drawn between mosaic poetry and modern painting or film-making. It also examines the ways in which the music of pre-modern composers such as Bach and Beethoven has been used as a formal model by mosaic poets. The thesis offers a detailed analysis of &#8216;Canto XLVII&#8217; as a critical experiment in analyzing the reader&#8217;s temporal experience of mosaic poetry, his &#8216;shifting gestalts&#8217; as he explores the &#8216;field&#8217; of the poem. The analysis seeks to clarify the way in which The Cantos combines &#8216;Imagist&#8217; hardness with the fluidity of Symbolist poetry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of the problem solving strategies used in family discussion groups</field><field name="creator">Everts, Johannes F.</field><field name="description">This investigation was inspired by Carkhuff's postulated that the principles which underlie effective counseling are equally pertinent to everyday human relationships &#8211; such as one may observe in the family. Carkhuff has not articulated this postulate in any detail and the present investigation both develops the notion of family problem solving strategies and tests it out in a practical situation. The development of this notion of family problem solving strategies begins with an integration of Carkhuff's model of the counseling process with similar models put forward by other authors. This is followed by a detailed analysis of family problem solving strategies as reported in the literature, and collation of data from both sources into a so-called Family Transaction Model (FTM). This Model consists of a series of distinctive though related parameters of family problem solving which include inner feelings, listening, self-expression, conflict management, the determination and execution of action plans, and the roles adopted by family members. Each parameter is defined in terms of specific behaviours or skills, postulated as necessary for effective problem solving. This FTM is then subjected to empirical validation in a comprehensive field study using 75 members of 18 complete nuclear families. A factor analysis of data derived from videotaped family discussions shows up two distinctive factors, "supportive involvement" and "distracting involvement"; these cover the parameters postulated above albeit in modified format. The main measurement variables involved have satisfactory inter-examiner and test-retest reliability. The FTM plus ancillary measures is shown to be highly effective in discriminating between parents and children; the former virtually embody the characteristics of supportive involvement while the latter show its obverse or distracting involvement. The Model also differentiates between male and female parents and, to a lesser extent, between male and female children. But it does not differentiate between family groups defined as troubled or untroubled on the basis of their referral to some helping agency or their mutual ratings of problem solving effectiveness. The format used for this assessment phase of the investigation also demonstrates the viability of using questionnaire ratings to ascertain family problem solving strategies, the value of family group discussion of real issues as a means to gather diagnostic data, and the inhibiting effects of videotape recording on the interview behaviour of participants. Finally the FTM is used as basis for a short-term treatment programme of 4 further sessions, such as might be undertaken by community resource personnel who have limited time and skill. This programme proves ineffective in changing observed interview behaviour, though participants report beneficial changes in attitude, mutual understanding and family relationships outside the interview situation. The results further suggest that the FTM is a viable basis for a treatment programme but that it is too comprehensive for success to be achieved in so few sessions, that therapists require extensive prior experience and training, that family members need to be flexibly involved in treatment, and that the entire programme needs to be carefully planned with a high degree of structure in the initial stages. The results of the present study as a whole provide a basis for further investigation including the validation of the FTM with a wide range of family groups, the development of more comprehensive rating scales, modifications in the assessment interview&#8217;s format, the development of a more effective treatment programme, and the development of an appropriate training programme for community resource personnel.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species identity, genetic diversity, and molecular systematic relationships among the Ziphiidae (beaked whales)</field><field name="creator">Dalebout, Merel Louise</field><field name="description">Beaked whales (family Ziphiidae) are one of the least known of all mammalian groups. The majority of species have been described from only a handful of specimens. Found in deep ocean waters, these species are widespread and often sexually dimorphic. Little is known of intra-specific variation in morphology, and many species are very similar in external appearance. A reference database of mitochondrial DNA sequences was compiled for all 20 recognised ziphiid species to aid in species identification. All reference sequences were derived from validated specimens, which were often represented only by bone or teeth. DNA was obtained from this &#8216;historic&#8217; material using &#8216;ancient&#8217; DNA methods. For three species, holotypes were sampled. Phylogenetic analyses using this database led to the discovery of a new, previously unrecognised species of beaked whale (Mesoplodon perrini), new specimens of Longman's beaked whale (Indopacetus pacificus), a species known previously from only two partial skulls and the synonymy of a third (M. traversii = M. bahamondi).    Phylogenetic reconstructions based on sequence data from three mitochondrial and two nuclear loci (total, 2815 bp) using neighbour joining, parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods, resolved many of the sister-species relationships in this group. Inferred relationships among Mesoplodon beaked whales indicated that cranial and tooth morphology may be far more variable between closely related species than previously assumed. No support was found for a linear-progression of tooth form as suggested by Moore (1968) in his phenetic evaluation of relationships among the Ziphiidae. The geographic distribution of Mesoplodon species with similar or divergent tooth morphology is likely due to a combination of sexual selection and selection for species recognition. Both hypotheses predict similar patterns, such as dissimilar tooth morphology among species with sympatric or parapatric distributions. However, only sexual selection appears to offer an explanation for why there are so many Mesoplodon beaked whales.    Investigation of mtDNA diversity among a number of beaked whale species indicated that nucleotide diversity was generally lower in this group than in other wide-ranging oceanic cetaceans. The cause of this low diversity was not clear but may be indicative of overall low abundance. Particularly low levels of diversity were found in Baird's beaked whale Berardius bairdii , Arnoux's beaked whale B. arnuxii and the northern bottlenose whale Hyperoodon ampullatus. Strong geographic structure in haplotype frequencies was observed among a worldwide sample of Cuvier's beaked whales Ziphius cavirostris.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, GENETICS (0369)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, ZOOLOGY (0472)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/21</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and evaluation of projects with variable labour response: case study of agricultural aid on Atiu</field><field name="creator">Bollard, Alan</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses producer response to technical change using agricultural aid projects on Atiu, Cook Islands, as an example.

Unimproved values for individual parcels of land are aggregated into 301 areal units and multiple regression analysis is used to explain the spatial pattern of values in 1970. Temporal variations in the pattern of unimproved values and the influence of increasing values on the distribution of agricultural land use are also explored. The study area comprise most of the territory over which the Auckland Regional Authority has jurisdiction. Both 'accessibility' and 'area-characteristics' models are used to interpret the pattern of unimproved values in 1970. In general the area-characteristics models are the most successful, but higher R2 values are achieved with hybrid models that combine road distance from the CBD modified by travel time, with such characteristics of areas as size of holding, land use, and terrain. In analysing the pattern of values in 1955, 1960, and 1365 compared with 1970, the statistical contribution of road distance to the CBD compared with terrain is stressed. Distance becomes a more effective predictor of value through time, while the explanation contributed by terrain-characteristics deteriorates. The large increases in the value of land that the region has experienced during the period studied are shown to have had less influence on the distribution of agriculture than has been suggested in other contexts. The main reasons advanced for the resilience of agriculture is its ability to compete for land, which is influenced by legislation allowing the postponement of rates (territorial local authority land taxes) on some agricultural land. The means by which quotas are allocated to farmers supplying liquid milk, and the marketing of fruit and vegetables direct to consumers, are also important in maintaining agricultural land in production.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2103</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The antagonistic city: a design for urban imagery in seven American poets</field><field name="creator">Locke, Terry</field><field name="description">The purpose of this dissertation has been to investigate the significance of urban imagery in the work of seven American poets: Walt Whitman, Stephen Crane, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Robert Frost, Hart Crane, William Carlos Williams, and Wallace Stevens. Although I have concentrated on the poetry, I have also ranged freely over the published writing of all these men. My conclusions can be reduced to these two propositions: 1. That the significance of a literary city can be understood only in conjunction with an attempt to explore the significance of other literary landscapes. 2. The significance of the city (and other landscapes) as metaphor is to be understood in terms of a basic process whereby the self is realized. This process is most simply represented geographically by a pattern of withdrawal and return, with the city and wilderness figuring as poles between which the self moves. The second proposition can be elaborated as follows: The process begins with the individual in a condition of alienation from his culture. This is culture, not just as a system of meaning and value, but culture as a way in which experience is ordered. At this point in the process, the city becomes a metaphor for the structures whereby a culture orders its common experience. The most basic ground for social alienation is that these structures serve to cut the individual off from experience. The response to this alienation is a desire to undergo a reductive process whereby orientative structures are simplified or demolished. The aim of such a process, which has a corresponding metaphor in the geographical metaphor of withdrawal, is to restore contact with experience. The experiential world is characterized by the absence of structure. Its cardinal metaphor is nature as wilderness (wildness), though, again, the city as oceanic and dislocative can fulfil a like function. It is in the unmediated intercourse with such a world that the self is realized. At this point a sense of meaning and value arises as experience is assimilated and integrated. The result of such an integration is a structure valid for the self&#8212;a structure, we might note, with no claims to permanence or finality. What is discovered in the wilderness is not so much a final structure, as a way of structuring. Which is what the realized individual brings back to the society from which he remains alienated. As the city can serve as metaphor for social structures, so it can serve as a metaphor for the structure (and the way of structuring) that might be--an ideal city. The final task is the discovery of a role that might facilitate the realization of this authentic culture.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interhemispheric transfer in a marsupial : a behavioural investigation of interhemispheric transfer of visual information in Trichosurus vulpecula</field><field name="creator">Webster, Donald MacDonald</field><field name="description">Eight marsupial phalangers, (Trichosurus vulpecula) with mid-saggital section of the optic chiasma were trained monocularly in a visual discrimination task, as were four which had, in addition, mid-saggital sections of the anterior commissure, fasciculus aberrans and hippocampal commissure. All were tested for transfer to the untrained hemisphere. The results showed that those with the commissures intact transferred information to the hemisphere not trained directly, while those with commissures sectioned did not. It appears that transfer of visual information between cerebral hemispheres can take place in an animal which lacks a corpus callosum, and that the forebrain commissures may be the functional equivalent, in this marsupial, of the corpus callosum in eutherians. A further eight animals received mid-saggital section of the optic chiasma. Two had all other interhemispheric pathways intact, two had mid-saggital section of fasciculus aberrans and hippocampal and anterior commissures, two had fasciculus aberrans only sectioned, and two had fasciculus aberrans only intact. All were trained monocularly in a visual discrimination task and tested for transfer to the opposite hemisphere. Those with all commissural pathways intact and those with only fasciculus aberrans intact demonstrated transfer. Those with all commissures sectioned and those with only fasciculus aberrans sectioned did not show transfer. It seems probable that integrity of fasciculus aberrans is a necessary and sufficient commissural condition for interhemispheric transfer of visual information in this marsupial.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1975.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2106</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of orthogonality and antisymmetrisation in the strong-coupling model of nuclear cluster reactions</field><field name="creator">Thompson, Ian Joseph</field><field name="description">The possibility and feasibility is investigated of including in the modelling of nuclear cluster reactions a unified treatment of the effects both of the non-orthogonalities between transfer channels, and of the antisymmetrisation required by the Pauli Principle. The deuteron - nucleus interaction, the simplest cluster reaction, is considered in detail within the Coupled Channels framework. The Coupled Channels formalism was chosen because it accurately handles inelastic and transfer couplings of arbitary strengths. The fact that transfer channels are orthogonal to each other only asymptotically is taken into account by reallocating the wave function in the internal region, from the deuteron channels to the transfer channels, taking components from the deuteron channels in ways exactly analogous to the way the antisymmetrisation requirements remove blocked deuteron-core components. Thus a unified treatment of the two effects is facilitated. It is found further that when all possible transfer channels are included, along with all Pauli blockings from the core nucleons, then under certain conditions at low energies, the wave function in the deuteron channel is small and oscillatory in the internal region, leaving the deuteron as a cluster to have largely asymptotic significance. In this limit, the exact non-local potential governing the deuteron channel simplifies considerably in one approximation to be replaceable by just several orthogonality conditions, and these are easily modelled in solving the coupled equations for the radial wave functions. This simplified and unified model has the advantage, since the deuteron's internal wave form is significant only asymptotically, of allowing automatically for arbitary deuteron polarisation by the core (though not vice-versa). Furthermore, the asymptotic matching is not at a fixed radius as in R-matrix theory, but is a continuous process that depends on the binding energies of the actual proton &amp; neutron bound states in the residual nucleus.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics::240302 Nuclear and particle physics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The aqueous radiation chemistry of cysteamine and some related compounds</field><field name="creator">Sims, Ritchie John</field><field name="description">The radiation chemistry of cysteamine and of cysteamine-S- phosphoric acid in oxygen-free and oxygenated solution has been studied at acidic and near-neutral pH. In oxygen-free solution and in oxygenated solution above pH 5 the mechanism of cysteamine radiolysis appears similar to that of cysteine. From measurements of the dependence of G(-RSH), G(RSSR), and G(H2O2) upon pH and cysteamine concentration, suggestions regarding the stoichiometry of the chain reaction occurring at higher pH and the mechanistic implications have been made. The dependence of the rate of oxidation of cysteamine by hydrogen peroxide upon pH has been studied, second-order kinetics being observed over the pH range 6.5 to 10.9, and the rate has been found to depend in a simple manner upon ionisation of the thiol. The rate constant of the reaction of aquated electrons with cysteamine-S-phosphoric acid has been measured as about 5 x 109 M-1 sec-1 by competition with cysteamine at pH 4.2, and measurements have indicated the formation of orthophosphate, inorganic phosphorothioate, and an aldehyde as products of the reaction of hydroxyl radicals with cysteamine-S-phosphoric acid at pH 8.6.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1972.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Solvent extraction of cobalt and nickel carboxylates</field><field name="creator">Woollard, Gerald Andrew</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with the solvent extraction of ternary complexes of cobalt(II) and nickel(II). In a preliminary survey, the extraction of nickel(II) by a variety of systems containing carboxylic acids in the presence of 1,2-diaminoethanes was investigated in order to determine the extent to which these complexes extract into different solvents. The aromatic carboxylic acids studied were benzoic, p-toluic, phenylacetic, cinnamic, anthranilic and salicylic acid while the aliphatic acids studied were butanoic, hexanoic, octanoic, decanoic, dodecanoic, 2-bromohexanoic, 2-brom&#246;octanoic, chloroacetic and 2-chloropropanoic acid. The 1,2-diaminoethane used in conjunction with these acids were ethylenediamine, 1,2-diaminopropane, 1,2-diamino-2-methylpropane, 1,2-diaminocyclohexane, N,N'-diaminoethylenediamine, N,N-diaminoethylenediamine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine. Of the aromatic ternary systems studied, salicylic acid with either 1,2-diaminocyclohexane or a N-substituted diamine were found to give the highest extraction. These were then investigated in depth to determine the number and nature of the extracted species. Unlike the aromatic acids, the longer chain n-carboxylic acids are capable of quantitative extraction in the absence of a diamine. During the course of this part of the project it therefore became necessary to investigate the extraction of nickel(II) both by the acids alone and by the acids in combination with a diamine. It was found that the inclusion of a diamine had little influence on the pH of extraction. Finally, the extraction of cobalt(II) by combination of salicylic acid and N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine and by decanoic acid alone were investigated. The behaviour of cobalt(II) and nickel(II) in equivalent systems were compared in order to assess the degree of separation obtainable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2110</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrosyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Laing, Kerry Richard</field><field name="description">This study concerns the synthesis, structure and reactivity of nitrosyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium. Attempts have been made to prepare coordinatively saturated and unsaturated complexes and a study of their oxidative addition reactions bears considerable resemblance to the more familiar carbonyl complexes M(CO)3(PPh3)2. A number of interesting atom transfer reactions, generally involving oxygen, have been observed. The d8 complex RuCl(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 results from the interaction of RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 with N-methyl-N-nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide. The labile halide ligand is readily displaced by a large range of anions and it is believed that both linear and bent nitrosyl linkages may exist for different members of this series. The structures of these complexes are discussed in the light of recent X-ray crystal structure data. Halogens and hydrogen halides add to give the familiar RuX3(NO)(PPh3)2; RuCl3(NO)(PPh2Me)2 is prepared in a direct reaction and also by phosphine exchange and 1H n.m.r. data confirm that the phosphine ligands are trans. The complexes RuX(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 react readily with O2 to form the dioxygen complexes Ru(O2)X(NO)(PPh3)2. Halogens and hydrogen halides produce RuX3(NO)(PPh3)2. The dioxygen complexes react with SO2 and N2O4 to give sulphato and dinitrato complexes respectively. The reaction with CO results in the intramolecular oxidation of the nitrosyl group to coordinated nitrate accompanied by the incorporation of two moles of CO, i.e. RuX(NO3)(CO)2(PPh3)2 is formed. The dioxygen complexes catalytically oxidise triphenylphosphine or triphenylarsine to the respective oxides and RuX(NO)(PPh3)2 can be isolated from this cycle. Reactions of these four-coordinated complexes with O2, CO, Cl2 and NOBF4 are recorded. The dinitrosyl complex Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 is reported from a number of syntheses, the most successful being via a ligand reaction when RuCl2(CO)2(PPh3)2 is heated with NaNO2 and Ph3P in dimethyl formamide. The P-tolyldiphenylphosphine analogue is also reported and the mono-substituted product Ru(NO)2(PPh3)[P(OPh)3] is produced in an exchange reaction between Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 and excess triphenylphosphite. This phosphite complex reacts with Ph3P and O2 to produce Ru(O2)(NO2)(NO)PPh3)2 by an atom transfer process. Ru(NO)2(PPh3)2 reacts with the acids HY (Y = BF4, PF6, ClO4) and O2 to give the dinitrosyl cations [Ru(OH)(NO)2(PPh3)2]+Y- in which the two nitrosyl groups are structurally and electronically inequivalent. [RuCl(NO)2(PPh3)2]BF4 is reported and reactions of these dinitrosyl cations with halide ions to give RuX2(NO3)(NO)(PPh3)2, with intramolecular oxidation of the NO group, are also described. OsCl2(OH)(NO)(PPh3)2 reacts irreversibly with alcohols to form OsCl2(OR)(NO)(PPh3)2 (R = CH3, C2H5, n-C3H7, (CH3O)CH2CH2) which readily undergo hydride abstraction to form OsHCl2(NO)(PPh3)2. Sodium borohydride converts this complex to the trihydrido species OsH3(NO)(PPh3)2 and if the reaction is performed in the presence of Ph3P, OsH(NO)(PPh3)3 results. The coordinated perchlorate complex OsHCl(OClO3)(NO)(PPh3)2 results form the reaction of OsHCl2(NO)(PPh3)2 with silver perchlorate; this is readily reversed by chloride ions or the solvents CH2Cl2 and CHCl3. This perchlorato complex also arises from the reaction of OsH(CO)(NO)(PPh3)2 with HClO4 and a related tetrafluoroborato complex, OsH(OC2H5)(FBF3)(NO)(PPh3)2 by substituting HBF4. This complex reacts with Ph3P to give [OsH(OH)(NO)(PPh3)3]BF4, CO to give [Os(CO)2(NO)(PPh3)2]BF4 and LiX (X = Br, I) to give OsHX2(NO)(PPh3)2. OsHCl(OClO3)(NO)(PPh3)2 reacts with NaOH in methanol, in the presence of O2 to produce Os(O2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. This dioxygen complex is far less stable than the ruthenium analogue but it undergoes similar reactions. Ph3P is oxidised, SO2 and CO give sulphato and a nitratodicarbonyl complex respectively. Infra-red, 1H n.m.r., conductivity, molecular weight data and elemental analysis have been used in formulation and structural assignment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250600 Theoretical and Computational Chemistry::250603 Reaction kinetics and dynamics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1972.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of biological disturbance in determining the organisation of sub-tidal encrusting communities in temperate waters</field><field name="creator">Ayling, Tony, 1947-</field><field name="description">Biological disturbance was found to be one of the most important mechanisms control1ing community organisation in the temperate sub-tidal region. The different types of biological disturbance structuring three encrusting communities were investigated on the east coast of Northland, New Zealand. The operation of each type was determined and the rate of disturbance measured. Experimental exclusion treatments were set up to demonstrate the effects of the major disturbance agents on community structure. The urchin Evechinus chloroticus was the most abundant agent of biological disturbance and affected the widest spectrum of encrusting organisms. The abundant balistid fish Navodon scaber was another major agent of biological disturbance in this region. Disturbance of algal populations also resulted from a guild of abundant herbivorous gastropods. Two episodes of fungal/bacterial infection degraded numbers of the large sponges Ancorina alata and Polymastia fusca. The operation of the different disturbance agents was found to be generally unpredictable in both time and space. There was no escape from biological disturbance for encrusting organisms in either small or large size. Re-occupation processes on patches of free primary space were investigated both experimentally and by using settlement plates (artificial free space patches). Recruitment was found to be irregular in space and time, especially for long-lived sessile organisms. Settlement processes as well as growth and mortality of newly settled organisms were investigated with a view to understanding community development. Only one verifiable example of substrate preparation or biological succession was found to operate in the communities studied. It is postulated that community organisation is flexible and not rigidly directed along a single successional pathway. Multiple developmental pathways and multiple stable configurations are possible in the same locality, resulting from the operation of different disturbance regimes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270504 Invertebrate biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2115</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the reactivities of co-ordinated malonate, oxalate and carbonate</field><field name="creator">Rands, David Barrett</field><field name="description">The acid catalysed aquation of potassium trismalonatochromium(III) and potassium bismalonatodiaquochromium(III) have been studied. Almost linear plots of log kobs against the Hammett acidity function were interpreted as being due to an A-1 mechanism operating. Two kinetically different types of co-ordinated oxygen were found in a study of the oxygen exchange between the trisoxalatocobalt(III) anion and 0-18 enriched water. The carbonyl, or outer, oxygen atoms are thought to exchange by an A-2 bimolecular mechanism, while the carboxyl, or inner, oxygen atoms are thought to exchange indirectly by co-ordination of enriched oxalate groups to the cobalt centre during the anation reaction of the bisoxalatodiaquocobalt(III) ion. Finally, oxygen exchange reactions between 0-18 enriched water and various carbonato-ammine cobalt(III) complexes were studied, and it was found that generally the three oxygen atoms of the co-ordinated carbonate exchanged at equal rates, an exception being in the case of the carbonatobis(o-phenanthroline)Co(III) ion where the outer, carbonyl, oxygen exchanged faster than the inner, metal-bound, oxygen atoms. The first of these two groups has been interpreted in terms of a fast, reversible one ended dissociation process occurring, which is much faster than oxygen exchange, and the latter case in terms of a rate determining one ended dissociation step.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1972.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Byron's Plays: An interpretative study</field><field name="creator">Sharkey, Michael, 1946-</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the eight dramas which Lord Byron wrote in Italy, to evaluate this motives in writing plays, and to trace his views on various fields. The plays are discussed individually in some detail. The Introductory Chapter indicates the status of the theatre in Byron's time, and distinguished "poetic" dramas from plays written with a view to the stage. Byron's idea of a "mental theatre" is indicated, together with his involvement in the production of dramas as a member of the Drury Lane Management Committee. Chapter Two: Manfred, Byron's first play, written in 1817, is seen as a development from Gothic drama; a closer examination suggests Byron described the world in dualistic terms. The eponymous protagonist defies the claims of the "evil Principle in propria persona." Promethean aspects of the hero are indicated, and auto-biographical elements in the play are considered. Chapter Three: Marino Faliero is seen as a "political" drama, in which the tragic protagonist identifies the State as the oppressor of individual rights. The Doge Faliero's "traditional" code of ethics is opposed by a revolutionist ethic which he adopts in order to crush the State. Byron suggests the Doge is used by both the State and his revolutionary allies as a figurehead; the Doge's character is investigated, and Byron's involvement in political affairs is briefly examined to show any political motive in his writing the play. Chapter Four: Sardanapalus explores the idea of a humane ruler condemned by his subjects as too "soft," and deposed by traditional elements in the army and state religion. Byron's skeptical and "liberal" views are indicated. Chapter Five: The Two Foscari shows the "suppressed passions" operating against a political current. Byron is seen to question assumptions concerning "duty" and patriotism, along lines explored in the two preceding neoclassical plays. Chapter Six: Cain. Byron's most controversial play is seen as an attempt to define man's relationships to God and nature. Byron takes up earlier suggestions in his plays of a dualist view of the universe, and expatiates on his sceptic views. A notion of the mind's self-sufficiency, outlined in Manfred, is further developed. Chapter Seven: Heaven and Earth provides further definition of man's place in an ostensibly hostile universe. Japhet, the "hero" of the drama, is confounded by the apparent indiscriminateness of God's punishment of man in the Flood. The notion of plural worlds, suggested in earlier works, and particularly in Cain is again utilised. Chapter Eight: Werner. In Byron's most "theatrical" work, an inheritance of guilt is reviewed to suggest the notion of a "damned world." Byron's deliberate melodramatic structuring of Werner, and his concern with psychological investigation of notive are examined. Chapter Nine: The Deformed Transformed. Byron's last, unfinished, play provides a recapitulation of themes of the earlier plays and looks forward to the style and concerns of Don Juan. Byron is most "inventive" and unrestrained in this drama that abrogates all the classical unities and appears to work toward an endorsement of the idea of salvation by act of will. The concluding chapter relates Byron's view of the universe that emerges form the dramas considered separately and together. The particular aims of each play, and the stylistic features of each, which defy general statements about an overall ambition, are recapitulated. Byron's reasons for choosing dramatic form are briefly sketched in light of the investigation of individual works. His concern to experiment, and to avoid prescription, is seen as indicating a possible mode of operation for a revival of the English drama in the Romantic era.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420204 British and Irish</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2117</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and Behavioural Studies on the Ecology of some New Zealand Chitons</field><field name="creator">Boyle, Peter Robin</field><field name="description">Experiments on the responses to osmotic stress and desiccation are reported for several species of New Zealand littoral chitons. Qualitative and quantitative studies on the ecology of the common Auckland species have been undertaken, with special reference to microhabitat conditions. The micro-anatomy of the dorsal sensory organs has been studied, and related to the comparative responses to light stimuli, and experiments involving interference with these organs. Sypharochiton pelliserpentis was found t o be an osmo-conformer, showing only limited volume regulation but a wide tolerance to salinity fluctuations. Size of the animal had a negligible effect on the osmotic response, and it is likely that other chitons are osmo-conformers but with less tolerance of osmotic stress. Animals of this species were better able to resist the effects of desiccation than several other chitons. This resulted from a kinetic behaviour pattern in response to low humidities causing aggregation in the laboratory, and a well developed tolerance of extreme water loss, Sypharochiton Pelliserpentis colonises a wide rage of microhabitats on rock surfaces, some exposed to wide salinity changes (13.28&#176;/oo to 45 .80&#176;/ooS) between tides, and others exposed t o drying. Population size structures indicate that exposure t o desiccation is likely t o be more important than osmotic stress in controlling populations, and microhabitat more important than tidal level. The other chitons studied were restricted to pools, beneath boulders or to wave-splashed situations which did not dry. One very fast-moving chiton, Ischnochiton maorianus exhibited photo-negative orientation and the 'shadow response', the full range of reactions to light stimuli yet reported in chitons. It possesses only the megalaesthete type of dorsel sensory receptor. Experiments showed masking or abrading these organs to affect the rate of response, and it is concluded that at least one of their functions is light reception. Hithochiton neglectus, a species possessing well developed extra-pigmental ocelli, did not show such clear responses to light. Problems of the structure and function of these organs are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1967.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2120</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel Products from Pentachlorocyclopropane: A Synthetic and Structural Investigation</field><field name="creator">Surman, Peter William John</field><field name="description">Primary and secondary amines react with pentachlorocyclopropane to form a variety of novel products. Amidines, allyl and cyclopropenyl cations are easily reached by these reactions. The 1,1,3,3-tetra-aminoallyl cations of this series can be reversibly protonated at C(2) to give diamidinium ions. Action of KOH on the diamidinium species CH2[C(NHBut)2]2 2+ produces the diamidine CH2[C(NBut)(NHBut)]2 which hydrolyses to the formamidine CH(NBut)(NHBut). Bis- and tris-amino substituted Cyclopropenylium ions are formed by the action of secondary amines on pentachlorocyclopropane. The cations of this study are stabilised by electron back-donation from nitrogen atoms of substituent groups- The subject of back-bonding was probed in several ways. crystallographically determined structures of representative salts afforded bond length data from which deductions about back-bonding were made. The measurement of barriers to bond rotation is another way that this effect was investigated. Using the technique of variable temperatue NMR, VT-NMR, spectroscopy, energies of activation about unsaturated bonds of allyl, amidinium and cyclopropenylium cations were found. UV-spectra provided additional information concerning bonding in these species. Tautomerism of N,N&#8217;-disubstituted amidines was investigated by VT-NMR spectroscopy. Individual tautomers were identified in NMR spectra (13C,1H). Tris-alkylaminocyclopropenylium ions were oxidised to form intensely coloured radical dications. The first Raman spectrum of a cyclopropenyl radical dication was determined. Using the technique of pulse radiolysis we were able to reduce the cyclopropenylium cation, [C3(Net2)3]+, to the molecular radical. Further, pulse experiments enabled standard reduction potentials of representative [C3(NR2)3]2+ and allyl radical dications to be measured and compared. In general, tertiary amines reacted with pentachlorocyclopropane to generate product mixtures. Reaction of para-dimethylaminopyridine, DMAP, on pentachlorocyclopropane was a case in exception. The novel allylide product is the same as that formed via an alternative route. The direct reaction of ammonia on pentachlorocyclopropane product several products including the formamidine NC-N=CH-NH2. A polyamide was prepared from the hydrolysis of a diamidinium ion. The mechanism of formation and the characterisation of this glossy, thermoplastic material is discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2121</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stratigraphy and sedimentology of the Te Kuiti group in Waitomo County, South Auckland</field><field name="creator">Nelson, Campbell S. (Campbell Symes)</field><field name="description">The Oligocene Te Kuiti Group in Waitomo County, North Island, New Zealand, is divided into two subgroups, six formations and seven limestone members; six of the members are new. The stratigraphic definition, distribution, thickness, lithology and contacts of major rock units, and the three dimensional relationships between them, are described and figured in detail. Rapid lateral and vertical lithologic variation in strata is accomodated by recognition of 31 lithofacies. Te Kuiti sediments, which include mainly bioclastic lutites, bioclastic arenites and biocalcarenites, were deposited in sublittoral waters, from a few to about 100 metres depth, as seas transgressed south over a topoqraphically subdued, but locally varied landscape cut in Mesozoic lutites and arenites. Distribution of major paleotectonic elements indicates the gross sedimentary environment was one of a north-facing, partly enclosed basin with a prominent north-trending median basement ridge (Piopio High) in the south. Deposition continued until this ridge was almost completely buried, at which time the Te Kuiti embayment expanded rapidly and linked with more southerly basins. The contact with the overlying Mahoenui Group is generally conformable in Waitomo County. Formations and members are commonly bounded by unconformities, mainly disconformities, some of which preserve features consistent with their interpretation as submarine hardgrounds. The unconformities record periods of erosion or non-deposition during major downward shifts in base level controlled partly by eustatic sea level changes. Comprehensive paleontological charts are prepared for each formation and age relationships established. Macrofossils are generally scarce, and dominated by thick-shelled, epifaunal bivalves. Foraminifera are more abundant and are mainly benthonic forms. Formations may straddle New Zealand stage boundaries and, within Waitomo County, are not strongly diachronous. Primary sedimentary structures in arenites and calcarenites include mainly thinly bedded wavy-, lenticular-, and cross-stratification formed by the spreading and interfering of sand sheets, sand ribbons and sand waves across extensive areas of flat shallow sea floor, possibly under the influence of tidal currents. Lutites and muddy arenites are massive and bioturbated. A new classification for mixed terrigenous-allochemical rocks is proposed and an X-ray technique developed for modal analyses of lutites. The petrography of individual lithofacies is described and illustrated in detail and summarised on pie diagrams. Variations in the kind, quantity, size, sorting and abrasion of bioclasts, in the king and quantity of matrix add/or cement, and in the content of glauconite and terrigenous sand and mud serve to distinguish the various lithofacies. Bioclasts are derived principally from bryozoans, echinoids and benthonic foraminifers and, to a lesser extent, from coralline algae, planktonic foraminifers, molluscs and brachiopods. Siliciclasts include mainly quartz, oligoclase &#8211; andesine plagioclase, potash feldspar, montmorillonitic clays and glauconite. Quartz and feldspar were detritally inherited from Mesozoic basement rocks; montmorillonite formed from the marine diagenetic transformation of vermiculite and degraded chlorite and illite derived from Oligocene soils; glauconite developed from mont-morillonitic clays under specific environmental conditions. Complete chemical analyses of seven glauconite concentrates are presented and compared with published analyses. The principal non-opaque heavy minerals in the group are zircon, epidote and apatite. Sediment pores are infilled with granular and rim ortho-sparite cement, or by a variety of matrix materials, including micrite, calcilutite and lutite. Petrologs display the vertical variation in petrographic properties through the group and, in conjunction with grain size analyses of insoluble residues, are used to interpret the energy level of the environment of deposition of individual rock units. Te Kuiti sediments accumulated under a spectrum of environmental energy conditions, ranging from quiet to strongly agitated waters. The primary Te Kuiti sediment was dominated by metastable magnesium calcite and, less abundant, aragonite skeletons. These skeletons underwent syndiagenetic stablisation reactions at, or close below, the sea floor. Large quantities of skeletal aragonite were dissolved from the sediment before lithification. Aragonite was preserved only where anaerobic conditions were maintained in the sediment. Stabilisation of magnesium calcite grains involved the texturally non-destructive process of incongruent dissolution, which yielded a replacement product of calcite. Sources of CaCO3 for cement included (a) solution of aragonite grains, (b) intergranular solution of bioclasts and, most important, (c) pervasive solution of bioclasts, under shallow burial loads, at those levels in the sediment relatively enrichment in siliciclastic, and especially muddy, material. Dissolved CaCO3 was precipitated as calcite cement in adjacent or nearby sediment layers. A paragenetic sequence of diagenetic events is established for the group. Finally, Oligocene paleogeography and paleoclimate are outlined and a synthesis of the environment of formation and depositional history of sediments of the Te Kuiti Group in Waitomo Country is established.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology::260111 Other stratigraphy (incl. sequence stratigraphy)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the biology and utilisation of Pterocladia and Gracilaria</field><field name="creator">Luxton, David Morley</field><field name="description">Pterocladia lucida (R. Br.) J. Ag. is the prinipal raw material for agar production in New Zealand. Since collection commenced in 1943 the annual harvest has never stabilised and over recent years there has been a general decline, which has inhibited expansion of the indigenous industry. Field and laboratory studies have been made in order to obtain information on the biology of P. lucida. Form variability is considered in detail and a relationship between external morphology and wave exposure of the habitat is proposed. The culture of P. lucida from spores in a running seawater system is described in detail. Results on carpospore and tetraspore germination, and sporeling growth under light and temperature regimes are presented. Germination of both spore types was inhibited at 10&#176;C while at higher temperatures germination was greatest under 4 klux. Spore germination and sporeling development in culture is described. Only sterile prostrate thalli possessing rhizoidal haptera were obtained and a hypothesis relating the appearance of surface haptera to the direction of irradiation is proposed. The development of an outdoor wave tank for culturing is described and the growth rate and development of sporelings is discussed with reference to water movement. Sporelings were maintained in culture for up to 22 months. Cultured sporelings have also been transplanted into different habitats. Creeping axes established from carpospores produced erect fronds, which produced tetraspores after seven to ten months in situ. This confirmed part of a Polysiphonia-type life history for the first time in a Gelidioid species. Axis elongation rate in situ was estimated to be less than 10cm year-1 at Leigh. It was concluded that the collection of attached weed could not be sustained annually, but controlled harvesting in specific areas every two years is advocated. Seasonal variation in agar yield and gel strength from wave exposed and sheltered populations of P. lucida was studied. Agar levels varied throughout the year, being greatest in spring and summer, while gel strengths showed a similar trend. The feasibility of utilising indigenous Gracilaria secundata Harvey forma pseudoflagellifera May has been studied. The yield and gel properties of agar were determined from different alkali pretreatments. There was a marked increase in gel strength when weed was pretreated in alkali, the maximum gel strength being obtained from a weed treatment of 3 percent NaOH for three hours at 80&#176;C. The gel properties of agar from G. secundata f. pseudoflagellifera are compared with agar from other sources. The agar was suitable for commercial use, but exhibited a greater resilience than that from Pterocladia lucida. The vegetative regeneration of G. secundata f. pseudoflagellifera in the Manukau Harbour has been studied and an experimental harvest of 0.68t is described. During spring 100 percent regeneration from hand cleared and raked areas occurred after eight to thirteen weeks. Based on regeneration results, mechanical harvesting four times a year of Gracilaria mats in the Manukau Harbour is advocated. The predicted sustainable yield is 1084-1304t year-1. The extraction and gel properties of agar from Melanthalia abscissa (Turn.) Hook. et Harv. are reported for the-first time, but the commercial collection of this species is not advocated.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270499 Botany not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2128</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Temporal mach bands: a psychophysical study</field><field name="creator">Kirkwood, B. J.</field><field name="description">Five experiments were carried out to discover whether there is a subjective enhancement of temporal contours analogous to the Mach band effects in spatial vision. A transient overshoot in the incremental threshold occurred immediately after the crest of rising linear ramps at photopic levels. A psychophysical matching experiment verified that this peaking effect is perceived as a bright pulse and can be considered the temporal equivalent of the bright Mach band. No equivalent of the dark Mach band at the foot of rising linear ramps was found. Rather there was an anticipatory decrease of sensitivity (Crawford effect) at the base of ascending gradients. The magnitude of this effect was directly proportional to the rate of change of the stimulus at photopic levels. Data from descending ramps was less simple to interpret. A small rise in incremental threshold was sometimes observed at the crest of ramps, but this effect was much less pronounced than the peak at the crest of equivalent ascending ramps. Matching procedures located troughs at the foot of descending ramps which correspond to the dark spatial Mach band. This effect was less apparent when incremental threshold techniques were employed. An experiment using exponential rather than linear change in luminance over time gave results in general accord with the above. The Crawford effect was found to follow the Bunsen-Roscoe Law. It was found that the transient undershoot and overshoot effects were related to the rate of change rather than the actual form of the ramp when the rate of change was greater than about 300mL per second. Impulse responses were derived by differentiating step responses. Ascending steps generated a biphasic impulse response and descending steps give a triphasic unit impulse response. This lack of equivalence over conditions is diagnostic of system nonlinearity. Fourier analysis of the impulse responses showed equivalent spectral components and lowpass filter action in each case, indicating change in gain and phasing rather than time constants occur between 'on' and 'off' conditions. The system was shown to be quasilinear within conditions since linear convolution of the impulse responses with appropriate ramps generated functions that were a fair approximation to the psychophysical response to such ramps. The relationship between the impulse response and the spatial equivalent line spread function was discussed and the similarity of the impulse responses to dynamic changes in sensitivity inferred from results of masking experiments pointed out. The results were then considered in relation to a multichannel model for processing spatiotemporal information.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2129</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hearts in the hearth: seventeenth-century women's sonnets of love and friendship in Spain and Portugal</field><field name="creator">Fox, Gwyn</field><field name="description">This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge about the realities of women's lives in the seventeenth-century Iberian peninsula, through a socio-historical interpretation of the poetic production of five women. One is Portuguese, Violante del Cielo, and four are Spaniards: Luisa de Carvajal y Mendoza, Leonor de la Cueva y Silva, Marcia Belisarda and Catalina Clara Ram&#237;rez de Guzm&#225;n. All are from the educated upper or noble classes and their lives span some one hundred and forty years, from 1566 to 1693. The thesis focuses particularly on their sonnets of love and friendship, both secular and religious. The sonnet was specifically chosen as the vehicle to study the ideas and concerns of literate, seventeenth-century women. As a difficult form of poetry requiring wit, artistry and education, sonnets enable a display of intellectual capabilities and offer opportunities for veiled criticism of contemporary systems of control. These women do not overtly rail against a system that offers them much in terms of social advancement and privilege. However, they do re-write our understanding of the Baroque by presenting their interests, pleasures and discontents from a feminine viewpoint. This detailed, contextual study of women's works, set against the philosophical, religious and moral treatises that governed their age, enables a wider interpretation of women's thought and intentions in the Iberian peninsula than may hitherto have been acknowledged, particularly in terms of relationships of affection within the family. Collectively, their individual works display a determination to demonstrate women's intelligence and moral strength. Furthermore, it becomes clear that women living within a system that utilised biological determinism as proof that they were incapable of reason, strive in their works to show that they are both capable of reason and determined to demonstrate it as undeniable fact.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420399 Cultural studies not elsewhere classified</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Spanish)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2132</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The middle Jurassic of New Zealand : a study of the lithostratigraphy and biostratigraphy of the Ururoan, Temaikan and Lower Heterian Stages (?Pliensbachian to ?Kimmeridgian)</field><field name="creator">Hudson, Neville</field><field name="description">The lithologic and biostratigraphic successions of Ururoan, Temaikan and Lower - Middle Heterian (?Sinemurian, Pliensbachian - ?Kimmeridgian) strata from southwest Auckland, south Otago and Southland, New Zealand, are described and discussed.

In Southland a new formation (Ben Bolt Formation) is proposed for the c.1340m sequence overlying the Flag Hill Sandstone, in turn overlain by a 485m thick, mudstone-dominated formation for which a long disused name is resurrected (Lora Formation). The Lora Formation is in turn overlain by a coarse-grained unit, for which the name West Peak Formation is proposed. In the absence of suitable alternatives, a subdivision of the Ururoan Stage into a Lower Ururoan, the range-zone of pseudaucella marshalli, and an Upper Ururoan, the interval-zone between the last appearance of Pseudaucella marshalli and the first appearance of a Temaikan fauna is proposed. The existing three-fold subdivision of the Temaikan Stage is emended. Belemnopsis mackayi and B. deborahae are retained as the indices of the Temaikan and its lowest subdivision, as they are present in most sections at a consistent stratigraphic position. Retroceramus (Fractoceramus) inconditus is proposed as the basal Middle Temaikan index species. Retroceramus(R.) brownei, which first appears consistently higher than R. inconditus, but below R. marwicki is proposed as the index for the upper Middle Temaikan. Retroceramus (R.) marwicki is proposed as a replacement upper Temaikan index for "Macrocephalites cf. beta-gamma" which is unsuitable. Meleagrinella n. sp. is inconsistent in its first appearance and therefore unsuitable as a Middle Temaikan index and, although confined to this stage, it ranges from Early to early Upper Temaikan. Basal Temaikan Belemnopsis spp. are absent from sections in the Catlins district whereas the earliest Temaikan taxon appearing above typical Ururoan faunas is Meleagrinella n. sp. In the absence of a better alternative Meleagrinella n. sp. is used to mark the base of the stage in the Catlins sections. However, the base of the Temaikan is here likely to be slightly younger than in other sections. Within the redefined Upper Temaikan four subdivisions based on the sequence of Retroceramus species are recognised. The lowest of these is characterised by the first appearance of R. (R.) marwicki, the second by the first appearance of R. (R.) n. sp. A., the third characterised by the first appearance of R. (R.) stehni, and the highest marked by the first appearance of either R. (R ) sp. C. (a wide triangular form) or sp. D. (an ovate flat form). The presence of these two morphologic forms indicate finer zonation of the Upper Temaikan may be possible, with further field work. The Ururoan to Middle Heterian succession of New Zealand is correlated with the international chronostratigraphic scheme based mainly on comparison of New Zealand's Retroceramus succession with that of South America and Indonesia and on relatively rare ammonites. The Ururoan is equivalent to the ?Sinemurian to Late Toarcian, Temaikan to the ?latest Toarcian to Early Callovian and the Early Heterian to the Middle Callovian to latest Middle to Late Oxfordian. Early Ururoan is correlated with the ?Sinemurian to Pliensbachian based on the presence of the ammonite Juraphyllites. Presence of the Early Toarican ammonites Harpoceras cf. falcifer and Dactylioceras spp. in the Late Ururoan indicates a potential international correlation of ?Late Pliensbachian to Late Toarcian. A ?late Toarcian to Aalenian correlation for the Early Temaikan is suggested by the presence of the European belemnite Brevibelus zieteni. Retroceramus (Fractoceramus) inconditus is similar to the Northern hemisphere Mytiloceramus lucifer and the northern hemisphere Retroceramus gr. popovi and thus suggests a latest Aalenian to Early Bajocian correlation of the Middle Temaikan. The earliest Late Middle Temaikan Retroceramus (Retroceramus) marwicki is also present in the Late Bajocian (Rotundum Zone) of Argentina. ?Teloceras gr. banksi, ?stephanoceras (S.) gr. humphriesianum, Chondroceras (C.) gr. evolvescens, C. (C.) cf. recticostatum, and C. (Defonticeras) cf. oblatum are present in the Middle Temaikan reinforcing an earliest to late Early Bajocian correlation for this substage. Toxamblyites aff. densicostatus Sturani, Chondroceras (C.) gr. Evolvescens (Waagen), C. (Schmidtoceras) orbignyanum (Wright), C. (Defonticeras?) sp. indet. occur with Retroceramus marwicki indicating an Early to Late Bajocian correlation for this zone, slightly broader than in Argentina. However, somewhat anomalously the first of these ammonites suggests a Mid Aalenian to Early Bajocian correlation. The succeeding zone (Retroceramus (R.) n. sp A. zone) has yielded the Latest Bathonian Xenocephalites grantmackiei and Lilloettia aff. boesei. Retroceramus(R.)stehni is the index for the third Upper Temaikan Retroceramus zone and is also known from the latest Bathonian to Early Callovian of Argentina. In New Zealand R. stehni is associated with Lilloettia cf. Lilloetensis and Xenocephalites cf. stipanicici which also indicate a latest Bathonian to Early Callovian correlation. The fourth and highest zone of the Upper Temaikan has yielded the ammonites Araucanites marwicki, Eurycephalites gr. extremus, Iniskinites gr. cepoides and Choffatia (Homoeoplanulites) sp. suggesting an Early to Middle Callovian correlation. The overseas relationships of the associated Retroceramus (R.) spp. C. and D. are unknown. The Heterian index Retroceramus (Retroceramus) galoi is of Oxfordian age in Indonesia where it is associated with Malayomaorica malayomaorica. In New Zealand Araucanites marwicki and Sulaites heteriense are present in the Early Heterian, below the incoming of Malayomaorica malayomaorica, low in the range of Retroceramus galoi. The presence of Sulaites high in the Early Heterian suggests a ?Middle to Late Oxfordian correlation while Araucanites indicates the lowest part of the range of Retroceramus galoi could be slightly older, perhaps Upper Callovian. The biostratigraphic scheme presented here is a significant advance on those proposed previously.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2135</field></doc><doc><field name="title">&#8221;My Two Countries Firmly Under My Feet&#8221;: Explorations of Multicultural Identity in the Fiction of Amelia Batistich and Yvonne du Fresne</field><field name="creator">Nola, Nina</field><field name="description">This thesis offers a detailed reading of the fiction of the Dalmatian New Zealand author Amelia Batistich and the Danish New Zealand author Yvonne du Fresne from the perspective of multicultural literary criticism. It draws strongly throughout on interviews and discussions with the authors themselves, and on their personal papers. The Introduction explores the term "multicultural literary criticism", examines its significant development in theory and practice in Australia (especially in the writings of Sneja Gunew), and discusses the challenging issues raised by its use in a bicultural context, in New Zealand. The body of the thesis is organised into two parallel sections, the first (of five chapters) on Batistich and the second (of four chapters) on du Fresne. Each section begins with an introduction to the writing life of the author concerned, with particular reference to the forces. Shaping her sense of identity as a New Zealander from an ethnic minority community. Subsequent chapters then discuss chronologically the development of the author&#8217;s work from short fiction and articles through to the later novels. Each author's struggle to find a fictional voice which expressed her identity as a hybrid New Zealander is highlighted. The role of editors and publishers in shaping the migrant voice of both authors is also explored, and the reception of both authors' works by critics often unwilling or unable to read for difference in a literary landscape dominated by the perception of New Zealand as socially homogeneous. The thesis argues - in an extended enquiry into the constructedness of identity - that both authors have struggled throughout their careers to find a place for both themselves and their characters in New Zealand literature. The bibliography contains a checklist of the published writings of both authors, primary and secondary material related to the field of ethnic minority writing, and a checklist of other migrant writings and creative multicultural works in New Zealand. &#8220;No matter how far fate has blown the frail tree of my life across foreign lands, its roots have always sucked nourishment from that little barren clod of soil from which it sprung."

Murray (Kenneth Murray)</field><field name="description">The reactions between tritium gas and organic substrates sorbed on irradiated silica gel have been studied. It has been found that tritium gas, when admitted to gamma-irradiated silica gel, is adsorbed on radiation-induced sites on the solid and bleaches the blue colour of the solid. The sorbed tritium becomes activated to at least two forms; one capable of exchange with alkanes such as 2 methylbutane and both capable of exchange with toluene and 2 chloro2methylbutane. High levels of tritium were incorporated into 2 methylbutane, 2 chloro2methylbutane and toluene, up to 32&#177;2%, 95% and 100% of the total tritium present, respectively, being incorporated (using 2 g SiO2, irradiated 15h), with high standards of radiochemical purity, (97&#177;1% for 2 methylbutane). Yields of labelled hydrocarbons were found to be sensitive to the conditions under which the silica gel was degassed before irradiation; optimum degassing conditions being evacuation for one hour at 973 K. Yields were also found to be dependent on the quantities of silica gel and tritium used and on the radiation dose given the silica gel, all three of these being increased concurrently for maxim yields to be obtained. In a study of the labelling of hydrocarbons of different structures it was found that alkanes containing a tertiary carbon atom were labeled heavily compared to straight-chain hydrocarbons; activity yields of the substrate hydrocarbon decreasing with increasing molecular size, to insignificant values with hydrocarbons heavier than 2 methylhexane. Unsaturated hydrocarbons such as hex-1-ene were found to undergo hydrogenation on irradiated silica gel to produce labelled alkanes; branched-chain alkenes undergoing double-bond isomerization. Reaction mechanisms for tritium activation and exchange have been proposed, involving ionization of tritium by radiation-induced positive holes in the solid and exchange of the ionic species with carbonium ion intermediates. It has also been established that gamma-irradiated alkali halides do not promote exchange of tritium gas with alkanes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes in the decomposition of network of queues</field><field name="creator">McNickle, Donald Christopher.</field><field name="description">There are two possible approaches to the problem of a network of service facilities, where an individual customer passes through the network, queueing for service at some or all of these facilities. Either we produce methods by which the network may be decomposed into small manageable parts, or we must attempt to solve simultaneously for all the properties of the network, at a particular time. At present, the class of networks for which comprehensive solutions are known is so restricted that it is usually essential to consider the first approach, at least in the first instance. First we consider the problem of decomposition points, the points at which a stream of customers is broken up into several substreams, heading for different destinations. Conditions are established for a class of decomposition switches, which ensure that if the input stream to the switch is a Markov renewal process, then so are each of the substreams. We then investigate the behaviour of one of these substreams at a subsequent service facility. When the service times are exponentially distributed, an analysis of this, the SM/M/1 queue, based on the properties of the busy cycle, considerably simplifies and extends the results known for it. Some attempt is made to relax the condition on the service time distribution. Since there is always the possibility that a Poisson process approximation to the arrival stream may be acceptable, the dual of this queue, where the sequence of service times forms a Markov renewal process, is considered. This seems a particularly appropriate generalisation, since it allows for different classes of service requirements, perhaps reflecting the origin of customers from various parts of the network. In addition, some results are presented for a queue in which both the arrival times and service requirements depend on the sequence of customer types. Since the output from a queue in a network will form part or all of the input to a subsequent queue, we consider, finally, the departure processes from queues of the types that have been mentioned. Although, in general, it is not possible to describe the departure stream from queues of these types in terms of a particular stochastic process, we can find the distributions of some of the parameters of a very general departure process, in particular, the number of departures from the last queue mentioned above.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::310000 Architecture, Urban Environment and Building</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1974.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2139</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hyperbolic Geometry and Reflection Groups</field><field name="creator">Marshall, T.

The cases k=l, n+1 give, respectively a pair of hyperboloids, and the ordinary n-sphere. In the first chapter we consider the pseudospheres as surfaces h En+1,k, where Em,k=Rk x (iR)m-k, and investigate their geometry in terms of the linear algebra of these spaces. The main objects of investigation are finite sequences of hyperplanes in a pseudosphere. To each such sequence we associate a square symmetric matrix, the Gram matrix, which gives information about angle and incidence properties of the hyperplanes. We find when a given matrix is the Gram matrix of some sequence of hyperplanes, and when a sequence is determined up to isometry by its Gram matrix. We also consider subspaces of pseudospheres and projections onto them. This leads to an n-dimensional cosine rule for spherical and hyperbolic simplices. In the second chapter we derive integral formulae for the volume of an n-dimensional spherical or hyperbolic simplex, both in terms of its dihedral angles and its edge lengths. For the regular simplex with common edge length &#947; we then derive power series for the volume, both in u = sin&#947;/2, and in &#947; itself, and discuss some of the properties of the coefficients. In obtaining these series we encounter an interesting family of entire functions, Rn(p) (n a nonnegative integer and p&#949;C). We derive a functional equation relating Rn(p) and Rn-1(p). Finally we classify, up to isometry, all tetrahedra with one or more vertices truncated, for which the dihedral angles along the edges formed by the truncatons. are all &#960;/2, and the remaining dihedral angles are all sub-multiples of &#960;. We show how to find the volumes of these polyhedra, and find presentations and small generating sets for the orientation-preserving subgroups of their reflection groups. For particular families of these groups, we find low index torsion free subgroups, and construct associated manifolds and manifolds with boundary In particular, we find a sequence of manifolds with totally geodesic boundary of genus, g&#8805;2, which we conjecture to be of least volume among such manifolds.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2140</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Remote sensing techniques for geothermal investigation and monitoring in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Mongillo, M. A. (Mike A.), 1949-</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of remote sensing techniques for the investigation and monitoring of geothermal areas in the Taupo volcanic zone of New Zealand. The research and development of a helicopter-borne video thermal infrared scanner technique and associated computer image processing methods constitutes the major portion of this study. In addition, preliminary results are presented from a related shallow ground temperature study conducted to investigate diurnal, seasonal and meteorological effects on temperatures in active thermal ground and results from a precursory assessment of SPOT-l satellite multispectral imagery obtained over the Waiotapu Geothermal Field for detecting, identifying and mapping characteristic geothermal surface features are also reported. The initial conduct of two video thermal IR scanner test surveys, one using an Inframetrics 525 over portions of the Rotorua Geothermal Field, the other using a FLIR 1000A over portions of the Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal Field, demonstrated that imagery useful for basic geothermal feature mapping could be obtained in the late summer to early autumn period. Surveying during the hours around dusk was shown to be appropriate. Experimentation established instrument operating settings and defined nominal survey parameters. The real-time video imagery format proved useful as an aid to navigation and as a check on proper instrument set-up and operation- The helicopter platform provided valuable manoeuvrability and control. The results obtained from these two initial surveys aided development of survey design and conduct methodology. The video imagery obtained with both the Inframetrics and FLIR scanners was compatible with New Zealand's PAL standard- Visual TV-VCR inspection of the IR imagery allowed easy identification of a range of natural thermal features. Identification of cultural features aided location of the thermal anomalies. The Inframetrics imagery suffered from serious banding and other minor problems. The FLIR imagery was of a generally higher quality, though it exhibited problems. The fundamental ability to digitize images from the videotapes and apply powerful computer image processing techniques to aid interpretation and analysis was demonstrated. A methodology for pre-processing and enhancing the digitized Inframetrics and FLIR images was developed. Application of these image processing techniques brought out detail unavailable in the grey-level imagery and greatly increased interpretation ability. The demonstrated success of the first two test surveys led to the conduct of the first known large-scale video thermal IR scanner surveys of geothermal fields. Most details of the first of these ate confidential (at the client's request). A complete range of geothermal features was detected and easily recognised and their distribution established thus providing a much more detailed map of the geothermal activity than was previously available. The successful results attained confirmed the survey design and conduct methodology used. The second and largest survey covered the entire Rotorua Geothermal Field (l8 km2). Imagery was obtained with both the Inframetrics and FLIR IR scanners and a visible wavelength video camera. Extensive ground control measurements were made. This comprehensive survey of geothermal activity established a baseline from which change can be monitored The survey identified large scale seepage and submerged thermal input into Lake Rotorua which may be the source of known missing chloride. The first geothermal surface feature changes were identified, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the method for monitoring change. Preliminary image temperature calibration results were obtained and a procedure for constructing visible wavelength-thermal IR composite images was developed. The positive results demonstrated by this survey have led to the helicopter-borne video thermal IR technique being adopted for major geothermal feature mapping and monitoring programmes in New Zealand. Preliminary assessment of the high spatial resolution (20m) SPOT-1 multispectral imagery of the Waiotapu Geothermal Field. showed that the larger geothermal surface features can be detected and identified on a contrast stretched, 3-band colour composite image. A shallow (&#8804; 1m depth) ground temperature measurement site was established in an area extending from very active to near ambient conditions. Preliminary results show that temperature variations ranging from l-19 &#176;C can occur in the most active ground. These temperature variations exhibit a strong negative correlation with atmospheric prcss111e changes and can introduce large, unexpected inaccuracies in ground temperature measurements.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Iodine azide addition to alkenes</field><field name="creator">Smith-Palmer, Truis</field><field name="description">Various systems for the formation of iodo-azide derivatives of alkenes have been examined. Iodine(I) azide, formed from sodium azide-iodine(I) chloride, has been found to exist in acetonitrile as a complex with sodium azide. The addition of iodine(I) azide to 5&#945;-androst-2-ene in both dichloromethane and acetonitrile has been examined in detail, as well as the addition of thallium(I) azide-iodine in dichloromethane to the same substrate. Products were identified as those arising by diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions, or by cis-addition to the &#945;-face of the alkene. Addition of iodine(I) azide in dichloromethane to 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene gave a cis-adduct as the major product, in addition to trans-diaxial adducts and a trans-diequatorial adduct. Formation of the products was rationalised as arising from c-3 carbocations or from trans-diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions. The major product from the reaction in acetonitrile was one of ring contraction. No cis product was formed in this reaction but an elimination product was present. Products from the latter reaction were postulated as arising from trans-diequatorial or trans-diaxial opening of either &#945;- or &#946;-iodonium ions. The reaction of sodium azide-iodine-crown ether with 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene in chloroform gave a high yield of the same product as those obtained in the reaction with iodine(I) azide in acetonitrile. The reaction of thallium(I) azide-iodine in dichloromethane with the above alkene gave products which could have all arisen via a c-3 carbocation. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azides of 5&#945;-androst-2-ene with silver(I) acetate in acetic acid occurred with retention of configuration showing that azide acted as a neighbouring group in the reaction. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azide(94) of 3-methyl-5&#945;-androst-2-ene gave, inter alia, a product where azide migration had occurred. Solvolysis of the trans-iodo-azide(95) gave mainly products of elimination. The action of iodine(I) azide on 3-methylene-5&#945;-androstane and 1-mewthylene-4-tert-butylcyclohexane was examined and found to be non-regio- and non-stereo-specific. Iodo-azides were also formed from 3-tert-butylcyclohexene and 3-methoxycyclohexene. In each reaction the major product was that of trans-diaxial opening of the cis-iodonium ion, while the second major product arose by trans-diequatorial opening of the trans-iodonium ion. The ratio of diaxial to diequatorial product varied with the iodo-azide-producing system being used, and was larger in the case of 3-methoxy-cyclohexene, especially when the solvent was dichloromethane. A mechanism was postulated which involves reversible formation of iodonium ions as the fast step followed by rate-limiting attack by azide ions. Solvolysis of these iodo-azides was also investigated. Prior to the current work, both an AdE2 and an Ad3 mechanism had been postulated for the addition of iodine(I) azide to alkenes and in an attempt to distinguish between these possibilities a kinetic study was initiated. Preliminary results indicate that the reaction with cyclohexene is electrophilic and second order.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2144</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the chemistry of titanium dioxide in fused salt solvents</field><field name="creator">Udy, David John</field><field name="description">An investigation into the chemistry of solutions of titanium dioxide in fused alkali metal borates has been made, with the emphasis on the ability of the alkali borate melts to dissolve TiO2 and subsequently crystallize TiO2 and/or complex alkali metal titanates. The preparation and properties of potassium titanates with K2O/TiO2 mol ratio &#8804;1 has been studied. In addition the thermal decomposition of potassium hexafluorotitanate monohydrate (reported to yield potassium tetratitanate) has been investigated. The decomposition product has been identified as an oxyfluorotitanate. The compounds crystallized on slow cooling of alkali borate + TiO2 melts have been identified. The titanium containing product(s) have been correlated with the concentration of borate groups containing non-bridging oxygens, which depends on the alkali metal cation. Phase diagrams for the M2O.B2O3 + TiO2 (M = Na, K) systems have been obtained. Mass transport in M2O.2B2O3 + TiO2 (M = Li, Na, K) systems has been studied, via measurements of electrical conductivity, as a function of temperature and TiO2 concentration. Additional information on the alkali borate melts has been obtained from measurements of the optical basicity of M2O + B2O3 (M = Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) glasses, using Pb(II) as probe ion. The results of these measurements have confirmed that the nature of the alkali metal cation significantly affects the basicity of fused alkali borate solvents. Extraction of TiO2 from ilmenite and titaniferous slag, using selected low-basicity alkali borate solvents has been attempted. The results indicate that TiO2 may be separated from ilmenite in essentially a one-step process.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250200 Inorganic Chemistry::250202 Main group metal chemistry</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2147</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic studies in reduction and rearrangement</field><field name="creator">Rewcastle, Gordon William</field><field name="description">PART ONE SYNTHESIS AND ACID-CATALYSED REARRANGEMENT OF CYCLOPROPANE-1,2-DIOLS A number of cyclopropane-1,2-diyl diacetates have been synthesized by the anhydrous Clemmensen reduction [Zn(Hg)-HCl-organic solvent] of &#946;-diketones and &#946;-ketoaldehydes, and this reaction was found to be a general one for those substrates that did not exist mainly in the enol form. Cyclopropanediol formation does occur with some highly enolized compounds under aqueous conditions but, with the anhydrous system, enol acetate formation or enolic reduction was found to compete with reduction of the diketo form. Acid-catalysed rearrangement of the free diols generally gave &#945;-hydroxy-ketones, or their corresponding &#945;&#946;-unsaturated enones, with &#946;-hydroxy-ketone formation only being observed with one substrate. A strong preference for methyl ketone formation was observed in all cases and this phenomenon was rationalized by consideration of the apparent relative thermodynamic stabilities of the &#945;-ketol conjugate acids. PART TWO AROMATIZATION OF 2&#945;-HYDROXY[4-13C]CHOLEST-4-EN-3-ONE The aromatization of 2&#945;-hydroxy[4-13C]cholest-4-en-3-one has been found to occur with migration of the labelled carbon to C-10, thereby lending support to previous mechanistic proposals. The aromatization of [4-13C]cholesta-1,4-dien-3-one similarly gave a product with the label at C-10, in agreement with earlier work involving carbon-14 labelling studies. The ease with which these rearrangements could be studied is in marked contrast to earlier work, and the combination of carbon-13 labelling and 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy offers many advantages over the degradative techniques required with carbon-14 labelling. PART THREE CLEMMENSEN REDUCTION OF (5R)-5-HYDROXYHEXAN-2-ONE Previous work in this department suggested that the Clemmensen reduction of &#947;-substituted ketones involved an intramolecular displacement of the &#947;-substituent by the carbonyl oxygen atom. However, the reduction of (5R)-5-hydroxyhexan-2-one had given a mixture of hexan-2-ol and cis- and trans-hex-4-en-2-ol, with no inversion of stereochemistry occurring with the saturated isomer. The opposite signs of rotation for the two geometrically isomeric alkenols suggested the possibility of different chiralities, but this was disproved when the 2R-configuration was determined for each alcohol by analysis of the 1H n.m.r. spectra of the esters with (-)-(S)-&#945;-methoxy-&#945;-trifluoromethyl-phenylacetic acid. This result thus invalidates the earlier hypothesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences::250300 Organic Chemistry</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2148</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of actinide-Schiff base chemistry</field><field name="creator">Hill, Roger Jon</field><field name="description">Complexes of tetravalent uranium and thorium have been prepared with the tetradentate ligands N, N&#8217;-ethylenebis(salicylaldimine), N,N&#8217;-o-phenylenebis(sali-cylaldimine) and the analogous ligands containing substituent groups in the salicylaldimine benzene rings (i.e. 3-MeO, 3-EtO, 5-Cl, 5-NO2).

X-ray structural studies have revealed the salicylaldehyde, N-Mesalicylaldimine, N-Etsalicylaldimine and N,N&#8217;-o-phenylenebis(salicylaldimine) complexes of thorium to be eight co-ordinate, with the salicylaldimine complexes having distorted square antiprismatic co-ordination and the salicylaldehyde complex displaying a dodecahedral configuration. U.V., visible and near-I.R. spectra of Schiff-base complexes of thorium, uranium, thallium and lithium are also reported and discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the ribonucleic acids of subcellular fractions</field><field name="creator">Bergquist, Peter.

It has become increasingly apparent to biochemists that a mixture of enzymes, substrates and products in a single phase could hardly carry out the many reaction sequences that must be involved in the metabolic transformations conducted by the cell.  Thus attention has been increasingly directed to the study of the discrete units of the cell with respect to chemical constitution and biological function.  The pioneering studies of Bensley and Hoerr (1934) and Claude (1946) on cellular fractionalism have led to what is now a powerful approach to the study of living cells - smashing them and studying the pieces.  The first objective of cellular fractionation is to find out what reactions take place and what compounds occur in the various isolated systems.  A second objective is to reassemble the pieces and relate their activities in various combinations to the activities of the whole cell.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of New Zealand, 1961.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2158</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of some co-ordination compounds formed between nickel diammines and the nitrite ion</field><field name="creator">Waters, Joyce Mary Partridge</field><field name="description">Pauling (1931) introduced the concept of the hybridisation of (n - 1)d, ns and np orbitals to explain the two classes 'ionic' and 'covalent' into which co-ordination compounds of transition metals appeared to fall.

This "peak shift" effect has been found following training in which S1 and S2 were presented successively, but not when they were presented simultaneously. In the present study peak shift was obtained when S1 and S2 were presented simultaneously during training. In order to isolate the conditions necessary to produce peak shift after simultaneous training, different groups of pigeons were given variations in procedure, but peak shift was obtained with all groups. The variations included using stimuli from various physical dimensions, using different training procedures, and using various methods of presenting stimuli during the tests for peak shift. The results were generally more consistent with discrimination theories that postulate the interaction of generalisation gradients around S1 and S2, rather than with theories that postulate control by some relationship between S1 and S2, and in particular, they were most consistent with explanations of peak shift that propose that the responding occurring in the presence of S1 is inhibited in the presence of S2.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Marine Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of southern Xizang (Tibet): bivalve assemblages, correlation, paleoenvironments and paleogeography</field><field name="creator">Li, Xiaochi</field><field name="description">This study is based on 15 measured Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous sections and their abundant bivalve faunas distributed mainly in the Nyalam and Gamba districts of southern Xizang. It addresses the establishment of bivalve assemblages, stratigraphic subdivision and correlation, analysis of sedimentary environments, sea-level change and paleogeography in light of the tectonic framework and geological evolution of the Xizang Plateau. The Plateau consists of three terranes: Qangtang, Gangdise and Himalaya They are separated by the sutures: Kunlun-Hoh Xil-Jingsha Jiang, Banggong Co-Nu Jiang, and Yarlu Zangbo Jiang, which represent three closed oceans: Paleo-Tethys, Neo-Tethys and South Xizang Sea. Stratigraphic development of the Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous of southern Xizang is especially closely related to the evolution of the South Xizang Sea Bivalves are one of the most common and important Jurassic and Early Cretaceous fossil groups in the Plateau. From 15 measured sections, 51 bivalve species within 26 genera are described, including 3 new genera and 14 new species. New genera: Vanustus, Yoldioides, Antipectenoides New species: Nuculoma oriens (Nuculidae) Yoldioides jurianoides (Malletiidae) Mesosaccella gangbaensis (Nuculanidae) M. Orienta Grammatodon (Indogrammatodon) sinensis (Parallelodontidae) Oxytoma jiabulensis (Oxytomidae) Meleagrinella minima M. dongshangensis M. sinensis Entolium dongshangensis (Entoliidae) Antipectenoides sinensis Ctenoides shizangensis (Limidae) Anisocardia shizangensis (Arcticidae) Protodiceras lanonglaensis (Megalodontidae) A stratigraphic sequence of ten different bivalve assemblages and four Buchia faunas from the Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous of Nyalam district, and four Jurassic bivalve faunas from the Gamba district are recognised. In addition, the Oxytoma jiabulensis bed and two Meleagrinella beds are also recognised. These assemblages can be seen to be of two types, high and low diversity, indicating different sedimentary environments. These assemblages along with co-existing ammonites also provide a good basis for stratigraphic division and correlation of the sequences. Special attention is given to nomenclatural and other problems associated with the important genus Buchia:. Australobuchia Zakharov is believed to be inseparable generically, and some Xizang species of Buchia an placed in synonymy. On this basis the evolution and migration of the genus is discussed From measured sections in southern Xizang, a comparatively complete Jurassic- Lower Cretaceous sequence has been established, which includes six formations: (in ascending order) Pupugar. Nieniexiongla. Lanongla. Menbu. Xuomo and Gucocun Formations. A new stratigraphic unit, the Gangdong Formation, is established, for Mid-Upper Jurassic strata of the Gamba district. Direct and indirect biostratigraphic correlation within China and between southern Xizang and other places around Gondwanaland is well established. Lithologic features, sedimentary structures and bivalve assemblages allow four environments including nine lithofacies to be recognised in southern Xizang: 1. Inner shelf environment 1] Shoreface sandstone facies 2] Neritic terrigenous clastic facies 3] Open shelf carbonate facies 4] Protected barrier carbonate facies 5] Reef limestone facie 2. Outer shelf environment 6] Siltstone-shale-carbonate facies 3. Slope environment 7] Fine clastic facies 8] Pelagic limestone facies 4. Bathyal environment 9] Dark Buchia-ammonite-lutite facies They can be seen to be organised into sedimentary cycles, which clearly show a huge transgression with three peaks in the Upper Jurassic reaching a maximum at the top of the Jurassic (Upper Tithonian). In the Lower and Middle Jurassic, sea-level changes fluctuated between coastal and shelf-sea environments, whereas in the Upper Jurassic, as a result of sea-floor spreading in the South Xizang Sea and the formation of fault basins, the area descended into bathyal depths. Paleogeographically, the northern part of the Plateau (i.e. the Northern Branch, or Neo-Tethys) underwent a shallowing process along with areal extension during Jurassic times, but shrank in the Early Cretaceous, whereas in the Southern Branch, during Jurassic-Early Cretaceous times, the South Xizang Sea developed a wide variety of sedimentary environments, including inner and outer shelf sea, continental slope and bathyal fault basin.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2167</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethylene Biosynthetic Genes in Actinidia Chinensis</field><field name="creator">Whittaker, David J.</field><field name="description">Actinidia chinensis, a diploid relative of kiwifruit, has valuable fruit characteristics, and varieties with superior flavour and marketable size have recently been selected in a classical breeding programme. However, the marketability of the fruit of A. chinensis and many other species of Actinidia is limited by poor fruit storage properties. Pioneering work in tomato has demonstrated that fruit ripening and senescence can be very effectively delayed by down-regulating genes required for biosynthesis of the phytohormone ethylene. The goal of this work was to isolate genes for ethylene biosynthesis in A. chinensis, characterise their expression, and to generate transgenic plants containing T-DNA constructs designed for ethylene downregulation. A small cDNA library was constructed from RNA isolated from the ripe fruit of A. chinensis. The library was screened for genes encoding each of the enzymes in the ethylene biosynthetic pathway, by probing with PCR products amplified from kiwifruit cDNA and with a cDNA clone previously isolated from kiwifruit. Three distinct cDNA clones encoding S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) synthetase (ACSAM1, ACSAM2 and ACSAM3) were isolated from the library, together with two distinct 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) oxidase cDNA clones (ACAO1 and ACAO2). No ACC synthase cDNAs were detected in the library, indicating low transcript abundance. However, a partial ACC synthase cDNA (ACAS1) was amplified from ripe fruit using PCR techniques, and subsequently cloned in a plasmid vector. Phylogenetic analysis of SAM synthetase protein sequences from A. chinensis and other plant species indicates bifurcation of angiosperm SAM synthetase sequences into two main branches; ACSAM3 was assigned to a different branch from ACSAM1 and ACSAM2. The peptide sequence of ACAS1 shows higher homology to several auxin-inducible ACC synthase peptides than the product of the ethylene-inducible ACC synthase gene which is predominantly transcribed in ripening tomato fruit. RNAse protection assays were employed to estimate the relative transcript levels of each of the ethylene biosynthetic genes isolated from A. chinensis during ethylene-induced, post-harvest fruit ripening, and in immature fruit and floral samples. The response of the mature fruit to exogenous ethylene indicated a clear separation of ethylene sensitivity and ethylene production in A. chinensis. The application of exogenous ethylene correlated with increased transcript levels for all three SAM synthetase genes (ACSAM1, ACSAM2 and ACSAM3) and for the ACC oxidase gene family. Transcription of the ACC synthase gene ACAS1 was not affected by exogenous ethylene, but transcript levels increased during subsequent ethylene biosynthesis, consistent with this being a controlling step for the onset of ethylene production. One or more ACC oxidase transcripts increased significantly both prior to and during ethylene production. Only one of the SAM synthetase transcripts (ACSAM3) was induced during the late ethylene burst, and these transcripts were also abundant in floral tissues and young fruit. A role for SAM synthetase genes in the methionine salvage pathway is discussed. The expression patterns for ACAS1 and the ACC oxidase gene family arc consistent with the consensus view that the rate of ethylene biosynthesis in plant tissues is dependent on both ACC synthase and ACC oxidase activity levels. Therefore, with the aim of down-regulating ethylene biosynthesis in A. chinensis, expression cassettes containing ACAS1 and ACAO1 cDNAs, each controlled by a d35S promoter, were inserted in tandem into the Agrobacterium binary vector pCGN1549, in both the sense and antisense orientations. Leaf tissue from the &#8216;Earligold&#8217; variety of A. chinensis was transformed with the resulting binary vectors, and transgenic plants were regenerated. PCR and Southern analysis indicated intact T-DNAs were integrated in at least half of the transformed plants, and Northern analysis detected mRNAs from one of the transgenes transcribed from both the sense and antisense constructs. No decrease in wound-induced ethylene biosynthesis was detected in the leaves of a small sample of these transgenic plants, and a larger number of transformants are now being grown for phenotypic screening. Down-regulation of ethylene biosynthesis may improve the storage properties and/or the shelf life of transgenic A. chinensis plants and may provide insights into the roles of ethylene in fruit ripening.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of dichloro- and tetrachloro- adducts of naphthalene and some of its substituted derivatives</field><field name="creator">Burton, Graham William</field><field name="description">trans-1,2-Dichloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene has been obtained as the major product of the photochlorination of naphthalene at low temperature, and is the first authentically described naphthalene dichloride. Its further reaction with chlorine, under heterolytic conditions gives, in part, a new naphthalene tetrachloride, whose configuration has been assigned, by 1H n.m.r., as being that of the r-1,c-2,c-3,t-4-isomer. The assigned configuration and conformation of the compound are confirmed by its behaviour on alkaline dehydrochlorination, which gives mainly trans-1,2,4-trichloro-1,2-dihydronaphthalene as an intermediate. The naphthalene dichloride, and its 4-chloro-derivative, have been found to undergo solvolysis in methanol - acetone (4:1), and it is further found that heterolysis of the carbon-chlorine bond at C- 2 is strongly favoured, leading largely to the 1-chloro-substituted elimination product. The former dichloride also gives a small amount of 1-methoxynaphthalene, which is possibly derived by unimolecular substitution at the 1-position. The presence of a chlorine atom at the 3-position of the structure is found to inhibit the solvolytic reaction. Bimolecular syn-elimination in these compounds is accelerated by the presence of additional chlorine substituents, and the increasing preference shown for attack at H- 2, which is further accentuated by the use of the powerfully basic reagent, potassium t-butoxide in t-butanol-dimethylsulphoxide (1:4), is interpreted as indicating a transition state tending toward the E1cB- like side of the E2 spectrum of transition states. The naphthalene tetrachlorides, and some derivatives, have been found to undergo aluminium trichloride-catalysed epimerization at the benzylic centres, which yields information on the relative thermodynamic stabilities of isomers with identical relative configurations at C- 2 and C- 3, and can also be of synthetic value. The photochlorination of 1-chloronaphthalene in CC14 at room temperature proceeds analogously with the reaction of naphthalene under the same conditions, giving five new tetrachlorides, four of which have been thoroughly characterized. The presence, in some tetrachlorides, of inter-ring non-bonded compressions between adjacent chlorines has been found to cause significant changes in the geometry of the alicylic ring, causing a tendency for the half-boat conformation to be adopted, provided this does not lead to 1,4-diaxially related chlorines. The strain present in these compounds is manifested by their very marked tendency to undergo isomerization in the presence of aluminium trichloride, and greatly increased rates of alkaline dehydrochlorination. The chlorination of l,5-dichloronaphthalene in chloroform, or dichloromethane, has been studied and has been found to be markedly catalysed by traces of iodine. The products are almost wholly derived by addition of chlorine in the first stage, and this has been interpreted as arising from a steric inhibition of proton-loss by the adjacent peri-chlorine.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tafesilafa'i: exploring Samoan alcohol use and health within the framework of fa'asamoa</field><field name="creator">Lima, Ieti</field><field name="description">This study seeks to establish how cultural change is transforming Samoan perceptions of alcohol and its role in social life by comparing understandings of, attitudes to, and patterns of alcohol use in successive generations of Samoans to establish how these are changing, and how trends in alcohol use might be expected to affect Samoan health status. It examines the complex relationships between alcohol and culture, and how such relationships interact to influence health. As well, it explores how Samoan culture, fa'asamoa, has changed since contact with Europeans, how, these changes have influenced Samoan people's perceptions and use of alcohol, and the role alcohol now plays in Samoan social life. Moreover, the thesis documents the social history of alcohol in Samoa since the nineteenth century, and explores the roles of some of the Europeans in shaping Samoan people's attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol and its use. Additionally, it examines the commercial and political economic interests of early European agencies in Samoa such as beachcombers, traders, colonial administrators, and missionaries which impacted on and influenced, to a considerable extent, Samoan people's drinking patterns. The study uses a qualitative methodological approach, utilizing qualitative interviewing as the main method of gathering data and various other methods to supplement the data. The sample population included Samoan men and women, of various religious denominations, drinkers and abstainers, born and raised in Samoa and in New Zealand. Unstructured interviews with thirty-nine participants, and eight key informants were conducted in Apia, Auckland, and Christchurch. The key informants included: a bishop of the Church of Latter Day Saints, the Samoan Police Commissioner, and the Secretary of the Samoan Liquor Authority who were interviewed in Apia; a pastor/lecturer of the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa who was interviewed in Pago Pago, American Samoa; while two Samoan-born medical health professionals, a pastor of the Congregational Christian Church of Samoa, and one New Zealand-born woman researcher were interviewed in Auckland. The study found that alcohol and the drinking of it has secured a place in the social life of Samoans in the islands and in migrant communities such as those in Auckland, and to a lesser extent, Christchurch. It also found that while older women's and men's experiences and attitudes to alcohol differ significantly, particularly those born and raised in the islands, some similarities in the attitudes and practices of younger people towards alcohol, especially those born- and raised in New Zealand have emerged.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Sociology)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-commensurate realization of compact broadband R.F. Circuits</field><field name="creator">Blomfield, Douglas Arthur Edmonds</field><field name="description">A new method for the synthesis of broadband impedance transformers having predictable passband frequency response is presented. The technique is based on the use of non-commensurate (i.e. unequal element length) transmission line networks. Through the use of approximations and computer optimization studies non-commensurate circuits are shown to be advantageous in distributed circuit design. The new method derives a non-commensurate circuit from a conventional commensurate prototype in such a way that the transmission matrix of pairs of elements in both circuits is made equal at one frequency. The transformation used ensures that the frequency response of the derived circuit closely matches that of the prototype circuit. Limitations on section characteristic impedances imposed either by constructional constraints or other practical realizability considerations are more easily met using the new design technique than when using conventional commensurate networks alone, Moreover, wide harmonically related passbands are largely avoided. The method finds greatest application where there are circuit length (or size) restrictions which must be met. Where such restrictions do not apply, conventional commensurate techniques are usually sufficiently flexible. The non-commensurate technique can however still provide benefits of even greater flexibility or better stop-band attenuation. The method presented is only an approximate equivalence and so an analysis of the technique is presented. The analysis establishes the degree of approximation. The use and application of the non-commensurate design technique are supported by an experimental investigation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Electrical and Electronic Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A land mobile radio coverage area prediction model for New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Rowe, Gerard Brendan</field><field name="description">This thesis describes research undertaken as an initial step in the development of a nationwide land mobile coverage area prediction model for New Zealand.

It argues that under-achievement is framed within boundaries of changing recognitions and realisations of power and difference: that conceptions of difference have influenced education policy and schooling practices for Maori. Theoretically, the thesis examines 'what counts as difference' and 'what differences count'. In recognising that unequal power relations between dominant and subordinate groups produce distinct views about difference, 'what counts as difference' encompasses the perspectives of dominant groups and 'what differences count', subordinate groups. The former view is developed to expand the basis for investigating 'Pakeha conceptions of difference', and the latter, 'Maori conceptions'. The thesis traces the interactions and relationships of 'difference' and 'power', and examines, historically, how they have contributed to and sustained Maori educational under-achievement. The contribution of these conceptions of difference to informing schooling practices is investigated through four sequential 'Classification Schemes' of Assimilation, Integration, Multiculturalism and Biculturalism. The thesis argues that Biculturalism is based on a positive view of Maori cultural differences, and examines the extent of Maori influence on four recent education policy making processes. The thesis also acknowledges a Maori focus on the importance of structural differences for addressing their needs. On the basis of those two different perspectives, the thesis develops the concepts 'Maori-friendly' and 'Maori-centred', to examine processes, and structures and the relative influence of Maori on mainstream policy forming processes. The thesis shows that Tomorrow's Schools, Education for the Twenty-First Century and the Maori Affairs Select Committee Inquiry encapsulate different degrees of both Maori-friendly and Maori-centred approaches, though arguing that ultimately, it is Pakeha conceptions of difference that inform and influence all the policy forming processes. However, the fourth policy process examined was originally a wholly Maori-centred initiative - Te Kohanga Reo. The thesis points to and traces the incorporation of Te Kohanga Reo into the mainstream education system and its consequences for Maori, and concludes that structural differences ensure continuing Pakeha control over Maori conceptions of difference and henceforth Maori educational under-achievement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">O le poutu: Women's roles and Samoan language nests</field><field name="creator">Utumapu, Tafili Leahnora Peseta</field><field name="description">Samoan language nests have become well established in New Zealand due to the commitment, support and contribution of the Samoan community, the church, Samoan families, parents and most importantly the efforts of mothers. Their advent has created new settings within which or through which women's roles may become redefined. This thesis explores the questions of how relationships between Samoan language nests and family systems have developed, and how these relationships may have affected the development of roles within Samoan families, especially women's roles.    To obtain answers to these questions three theoretical frameworks were utilised. Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological model provided concepts for understanding the developmental changes occurring in the transitional relationships between families and language nests. The second theoretical perspective employed was Vygotsky's (1978) sociocultural framework to analyse the cultural processes developing between Samoan families and language nests. The final framework was provided by Goodnow and Collins's (1990) concept of 'parents ideas'. Their argument is that parents' ideas and style of parenting has been influenced by their own ontogenic development, and by society's expectations.    The answers to the research questions were obtained by interviewing 21 Samoan language nest supervisors in the Auckland area and 100 caregivers or parents. Samoan language nests influenced parents, mothers and their families in their awareness and affirmation of Samoan language and culture, helping with parenting skills, provided support groups and served as an opportunity to gain knowledge and skills about preschool operation and educational processes. Language nests reinforced women's maternal roles, it changed the way they related to their children and the women's support groups encouraged women to assert their rights as women. The level of commitment by women is illustrated in the ways mothers and parents contributed at the language nests. Overall 92 percent of the mothers and parents helped at the nests.    The significant contribution of women in Samoan language nests serve to affirm her as a 'poutu', the 'superwoman', the strength of her family, of the church and her community.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, EARLY CHILDHOOD (0518)</field><field name="subject">WOMEN'S STUDIES (0453)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES (0631)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/22</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The solution of the order conditions for general linear methods</field><field name="creator">Heard, Allison</field><field name="description">The introductory chapter in this thesis examines briefly the nature of initial value problems and surveys the main types of methods used for their numerical solution. The general linear formulation of methods, first proposed by J. C. Butcher, is introduced, together with the definition of order for this class of methods. Finally in this chapter, the problem of stiffness and its effect on numerical procedures is considered. Following a review of Butcher's algebraic approach to the theory of Runge-Kutta and general linear methods in Chapter 2, the theory is applied in Chapter 3 to the search for general linear methods of various orders. As in the case of Runge-Kutta methods, the use of so-called simplifying assumptions plays a significant role in the practical determination of general linear methods. From amongst the range of possible numbers of simplifying assumptions, two cases are chosen and investigated in detail. The important question of stability is considered in the final section of Chapter 3. When a general linear method is used to approximate the solution of an initial value problem, special procedures are required to start and finish the integration. Whilst a major part of Chapter 4 is devoted to the determination of these procedures, the problems of the estimation of local truncation error and the implementation of general linear methods are also discussed. Finally, the Appendices contain Algol 60 procedures for the most important of the algorithms developed in the main body of the thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2212</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic Incentives and Clinical Decisions</field><field name="creator">Vaithianathan, Rhema</field><field name="description">In the face of escalating health care expenditure, OECD countries are turning to a variety of cost-containment strategies. This thesis analyses three such mechanisms. In Part I, I consider the use of coinsurance to limit the demand for health care. Because coinsurance reduces the elasticity of demand with respect to the price of health care, consumers facing low coinsurance rates may be charged a higher price by doctors. Such discriminatory pricing enables the doctor to extract surplus created in the insurance market, and therefore reduces the effectiveness of coinsurance. I show that in equilibrium, some consumers remain uninsured. I also show how this problem is solved if the doctor and insurer enter into managed care style arrangements. Such arrangements improve insurer and doctor profitability, and restore complete insurance market coverage. In Part II, I consider the design of fundholding schemes which encourage doctors to restrict expensive treatment to severely ill patients. I show that such schemes may be undermined by a patient-doctor side contract. In the face of such patient-doctor collusion, the fundholding scheme may be made collusion-proof by increasing its "power". I show that the optimal collusion-proof scheme may pay the doctor more than his reservation wage. An alternative solution to patient-doctor collusion is to use a partial fundholding scheme that requires some additional co-payment from the patient. Part III analyses New Zealand's internal market reforms. Introduced in 1993, the reforms involved the separation of funding and provision of health care, and were intended to simulate a competitive market environment, thereby improving the incentives of government owned health care providers to be efficient. On the supply side, I look at the internal restructuring of hospitals into private-sector clones. I argue that this commercialisation failed to take account of informational issues within the hospital. On the demand-side, I examine the suitability of internal markets for eliciting optimal innovation from the hospital sector. Again, I find that a standard argument, namely that increased competition leads to innovation, is questionable in the context of the internal market.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics::340200 Applied Economics::340204 Health economics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Economics)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2235</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium</field><field name="creator">Collins, Terence James</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium [LnM-CS]. In chapter 1 a comprehensive review of all transition metal thiocarbonyl complexes is presented. Unlike carbon monoxide, carbon monosulphide is a highly reactive molecule which does not exist under normal laboratory conditions. However, transition metal complexes of this reactive intermediate are typically stable compounds of which there are now approximately two hundred reported examples. This small number has made a complete review possible. Slow spasmodic growth has accompanied transition metal thiocarbonyl chemistry since the prototype complex was discovered in 1966 and chapter 1 discusses the synthetic reasons for this, describes critically the current bonding models, and presents the reactions of thiocarbonyl complexes. The very new field of the chemistry of selenocarbonyl complexes [LnM-CSe] is included and comparison with this and with the well-documented chemistry of carbonyl complexes allows for an analysis of periodic changes. The review indicates that CS ligand reactions had received little attention at the outset of this project. Interligand reactions involving CS were unknown primarily because thiocarbonyl complexes containing ligands suitable for investigating reactions of this type had not been synthesised. In particular, transfer of hydrido or aryl ligand to CS had not been observed. Such reactions are the subjects of chapters 3 and 6. The investigation of these transfer reactions necessitated the prior preparation of complexes containing hydrido or aryl ligands cis to the thiocarbonyl ligand. Suitable complexes were synthesised from the very versatile synthetic intermediate OsCl2 (CS) (PPh3)3 [Chapter 3], which was discovered after considerable effort had been devoted to finding high yield routes for introducing the CS ligand into the coordination sphere of ruthenium and osmium [Chapter 2]. Chapter 3 is concerned with hydride transfer to the CS ligand. The thioformyl ligand [OS-C-H-S] results from the transfer of one hydrido ligand to CS and subsequent reactions, which are also probably hydride transfers, produce the thioformaldehyde [Os-S-C-H-H] and methylthiolato [Os-SCH3] ligands. The possible relevance of these ligands as models for postulated intermediates in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is noted. The thioformyl and thioformaldehyde ligands were hitherto unknown and the formulations have been additionally verified by investigating the reactivity of these novel ligands and characterising the derivatives obtained. A synthetic route to secondary carbine complexes and to nitrogen and oxygen equivalents of the thioformyl ligand [Os-C-H&#8212;NMe and Os-C-H&#8212;O] is demonstrated. The review in chapter 1 also recounts how observation has shown that strong &#963;-donor and strong &#960;-acceptor properties of the CS ligand exert a profound effect upon the reactivity of CS complexes. In particular, strong &#960;-acceptor properties mark the CS ligand as an ideal candidate for stabilising very electron-rich metal centres such as d8 ruthenium(O) or osmium(O). In chapter 4 high yield routes to zerovalent osmium thiocarbonyl complexes are detailed and the reactivity of these complexes is exploited to afford the first high yield syntheses of dithiocarbonyl complexes. The thiocarbonyl ligand is also viewed, from the collected information in chapter 1, as being more responsive to the coordinative environment than the better-known carbonyl ligand. Thus, while CS can remove more electron-density from basic metal centres than CO, CS can also donate more electron-density than CO when coordinated to very electron-poor metal centres. Consequently, it is not surprising that reactions which have been regarded in a classical sense as electrophilic or nucleophilic attack at CO are also found for CS. In chapter 5 several novel reactions which can be described as nucleophilic attack at the CS carbon atom are reported for both neutral and cationic complexes. One such reaction is an interligand reaction of cis thiocarboxamido and thiocarbonyl ligands which affords a four-membered osmium metallocycle. Chapter 6 describes how coordinatively unsaturated aryl-thiocarbonyl-containing complexes react with potentially bidentate anionic ligands to produce coordinatively saturated complexes. coordinative saturation also occurs with carbon monoxide or isocyanide and these latter compounds undergo a rearrangement reaction which involves the thiocarbonyl ligand. Available evidence, which includes the results of an incomplete X-ray crystal structure determination, suggests that a bidentate thioacyl ligand [Os-S-C-R] is produced by transfer of the aryl ligand to CS with ring-closure. Some further reactions of this novel ligand are also discussed. In conclusion, the work reported here extends this research group&#8217;s interest in the chemistry of low valent transition metal compounds and the ligands which stabilise such compounds to thiocarbonyl complexes of ruthenium and osmium. The present status of the chemistry of transition metal thiocarbonyl complexes has been examined and the work presented in the experimental chapters contributes to this small area of chemistry by examining, for the first time, interligand reactions which involve CS, by providing synthetic routes to CS complexes of osmium(O), and by beginning to examine the synthetic potential of the novel compounds and ligands obtained.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2239</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Auditory-nerve and energy-detection models of temporal summation in hearing: a theoretical and experimental investigation</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Simon</field><field name="description">Experimental extensions and theoretical explanations of a psychoacoustic experiment concerning temporal summation of human hearing are investigated. The experiment has the well-established result that, ceteris paribus, a brief tone burst is more readily letected than a brief gap in a tone. Two models, one based on the neuroelectrical activity of the auditory nerve and one on energy-detection theory, are presented and developed in detail: both are shown capable of predicting the result of the bursts and gaps experiment. Seven experiments are reported. Experiment 1 found the reaction time to the start of a faint tone embedded in noise generally shorter than that to its end. Experiment 2 examined the effect of rise/decay time on the detectability of brief bursts of, or gaps in, broadband noise: when the energy change was constant, 1here was no effect except at long (100 msec) rise/decay times. Experiments 3 and 4 assessed the detectability of bursts of, and gaps in, a tone embedded in noise where energy change to noise power per cycle was constant but duration varied. The data demonstrate that the effect of duration on detectability was different for burst than gap events, a result predicted by both models. Experiment 5 showed that, when the energy in and duration of a tone burst in noise were constant but the temporal distribution of the burst energy varied, detectability remained unchanged. The repetition rate of noise bursts and gaps in continuous noise was varied without effect on detectability in Experiment 6. Bursts, however, were consistently mere detectable than gaps. Experiment 7 compared the detectability of increments and decrements of a continuous tone embedded in noise. The quantitative predictions of the two models are compared with the data resulting from Experiments 3, 5, and 7. The qualitative results of these and the other experiments are also discussed in terms of their theoretical implications. Taken all together, the experiments do not definitely favour either model over the other.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of natural antioxidants</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Jingli, 1966-</field><field name="description">This thesis relates the physicochemical properties of phenolic compounds to their antioxidant activities. It focuses on the partitioning of phenolic compounds between hydrophilic and lipophilic environments and the relevance this has to their in vivo health effects. Data in the literature was lacking so the phase partition coefficients (log P) of 53 phenolic antioxidants were measured by reversed-phase HPLC and calculated by log P prediction software. There was a very strong linear correlation between measured and calculated values (r=0.91). The importance of log P in determining antioxidant assay values was then tested by developing an assay system capable of measuring activities of both hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. This Lipid Peroxidation Inhibition Capacity Assay (LPIC), based on using liposomes to simulate a cell membrane environment, was then used to measure the activity of antioxidants with a broad range of structures. The activities were correlated against log p, the difference of heat of formation (&#8710;Hf) and half-wave potential (Ep/2) and used to derive a predictive model to calculate the LPIC activity. There was a highly significant linear correlation between the calculated and measured values. The LPIC activities also correlated well to published LDL inhibition activities but not to measured ORAC activities. These findings suggested that behaviours of antioxidants in the small unilamellar vesicles of the LPIC assay were similar to that in the LDL assay but not to the aqueous phase based ORAC assay. The LPIC assay may therefore be a better indicator of potential health benefits of antioxidants in the human body than the ORAC assay. The possible mechanistic reasons are that it may better reflect ability to prevent the oxidation of LDL blood stream particles that leads to cardiovascular disease and also takes into account the importance of membrane solubility which can raise the cellular concentration and thus potential to protect cells from oxidative damage.

The first section examines certain stability properties of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, a new stability property is defined, which is a modification to non-autonomous problems of A-stability, and its relation to B-stability is considered. A Runge-Kutta method is written as [see 01front.pdf for graphic] and classes of methods are constructed based on the property &#8721;sj=1aijck-1j = cki/k, i = 1,...,s and k = 1,...,s-1, where c1,...,cs are assumed to be distinct. Under this assumption a transformation is made, such that A = VsAsV-1s, where Vs is the Vandermonde matrix whose (i,j) element is cj-1i, and As has a special structure. These methods are examined in the light of the various stability criteria. It is also shown that the growth of errors can be estimated by an extension of this new stability theory and a number of examples are given. In the second section we consider the solution of stiff differential equations by implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, we examine a procedure suggested by Butcher [6] which enables an efficient implementation of Runge-Kutta methods. He has shown that the most efficient methods when using this implementation are those whose characteristic polynomial of the Runge-Kutta matrix has a single real s-fold zero. Based on this criterion a family of methods, called singly-implicit methods, is constructed, and results concerning their maximum attainable order and stability properties are given. Some consideration is also given to showing how local error estimates can be obtained, by the use of embedding techniques, for both singly-implicit methods and the more general family of implicit Runge-Kutta methods. Finally, an algorithm based on these singly-implicit methods is presented. It is tested on a number of stiff differential equations, and comparisons are made between this algorithm and others currently in use.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Intracellular Isosmotic Regulation in the Mollusc Melanopsis Trifasciata (Gray 1843.)</field><field name="creator">Bedford, Jennifer June.</field><field name="description">An estuarine mollusc Melanopsus trifasciata was studied with respect to its osmoregulatory capacity. Analysis of the environment, body fluids, and cell constituents was carried out and the results indicated that Melanopsus was able to regulate its cellular amino compounds in response to salinity changes. However it is isosmotic and more or loss isotonic with the environment as far as the haemocoelic fluid is concerned. An attempt was made to find out how or why this response of the cells to changing external osmotic pressure comes about. Various techniques were used: puromycin to block protein synthesis, labelled amino acids, time experiments, enzyme assays, and so on. Finally in the light of present day work the results were interpreted and a system of control put forward for Melanopsis which was later extended in general terms to all euryhaline poikilosmotic invertebrates.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology::270104 Membrane biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1970.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2264</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political labels and women's attitudes</field><field name="creator">Devere, Heather Mary</field><field name="description">This thesis is an exploratory study of women's attitudes to political issues. The thesis poses the broad questions of what is the range of women's attitudes to specific issues, what patterns are there to women's attitudes and how well do traditional political categories describe women's attitudes? Attitudes of women to five civil rights or moral policy issues censorship, corporal punishment, the death penalty, abortion and homosexual law reform - are examined and the way women identify themselves in terms of feminism and the left-right spectrum is also discussed. A feminist approach is adopted and focus group interviewing is the methodology which is used for the study. Some of the labels used to describe attitudes to political issues and political identification are discussed. The way the women interpret the labels of left and right and feminism are examined and patterns of self-identification with these political terms are looked at. The attitudes expressed by the women to the five policy issues are categorised according to libertarian, liberal, conservative, neo-conservative, authoritarian or humanitarian labels. The patterns of attitudes and identification are explored. The findings are that diversity and plurality characterise the women's views. Their opinions cover almost the whole range of views on the five issues, they respond differently to the use of the left-right spectrum and the label of feminism, and almost every woman demonstrates an ideological profile which is uniquely her own. There are some similarities among the women, but patterns cannot be easily identified using the traditional political labels. There is also an assessment made of the value of the focus group methodology which has been used rarely in political science. The thesis ends by posing more questions. The adequacy of the liberal and conservative categories for classifying attitudes is raised and there are questions about whether the focus group interview method is gender specific.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science::360104 Political theory and political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political studies)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Relations in a Northland Maori Community</field><field name="creator">Bhagabati, Annada Charan</field><field name="description">The Maoris today occupy a unique position in the wider New Zealand society.

(Craig Donald)</field><field name="description">The skua (Family Stercorariidae) are a group of large, gull-like, predatory seabirds. Two skua species are found in the Antarctic region; the south polar skua (Catharacta maccormicki) and the brown skua (C. lonnbergi). The breeding distribution of the former, is restricted to the Antarctic continent and nearby islands, while the latter has a circumpolar distribution which extends northward from the Antarctic Peninsula and includes many of the Southern Ocean islands. The south polar skua is strictly monogamous, while in contrast, a number of populations of brown skua are comprised in part of communally breeding groups. The brown skua represents the only known example of a communally breeding seabird. In every skua species, breeding females are on average larger and heavier than males. However, in most skua species this dimorphism is relatively small and is of only limited use in sexing individuals. The discovery of sex-specific fragments in the DNA fingerprints of the south polar skua is reported. The multilocus probe pV47-2 hybridised to Hae III restriction fragments which were present exclusively in females and therefore presumably W-linked. The presence of these sex-specific fragments were used to identify female adults and chicks. In addition, the use of these fragments as potentially informative maternal markers is discussed. The parentage of the 13 families from two populations from Ross Island, Antarctica, determined by DNA fingerprinting, revealed a single instance of extra-pair paternity and a single instance of a chick which was parented by neither resident adult. The most likely explanation for the latter is the 'adoption' of a chick from a neighbouring territory. Similarly, DNA fingerprinting was used to assign the sex of individuals of brown skua from a population which breeds on the Chatham Islands, New Zealand. A large proportion of the Chatham Islands population breed in communal groups. Each communal group was shown to be comprised of a single female and two or more males. Consequently, the overall sex ratio amongst breeding birds was biased, with almost twice the number of males as females. In contrast the sex ratio amongst fledgling chicks did not differ significantly from 1:1. The patterns of reproductive success in breeding pairs and communal groups of the brown skua from the Chatham Islands population were determined using multilocus DNA fingerprinting. Sixteen breeding groups were examined, the parentage of 45 chicks produced over three breeding seasons was established using the probes 33.15 and 33.6. No evidence was found of either extra-pair paternity or extra-group fertilisation and there was no evidence of egg dumping by females in any breeding group. These results suggest that long-term banding records for breeding pairs and communal groups accurately reflect the overall reproductive success of these individual groups. In addition, preliminary band sharing analysis indicated that adult members of communal groups were not closely related. These findings are also supported by banding records and are in contrast to the findings of the majority of communally breeding species studied. In the 10 communally breeding groups examined, multiple paternity within a clutch was recorded on two of the 12 occasions in which two chicks were reared. Furthermore, analysis of parentage of the chicks belonging to communal groups in which the adults had remained unchanged for two or more seasons showed that some males had variable reproductive success in different seasons. These records suggest that estimates of reproductive success of individuals based on a single season's data can be misleading. Should temporal changes in paternity (and/or maternity) be shown to be common phenomena in other species, this would have major implications for the interpretation of many parentage studies. The explanation of altruistic behaviour is one of the central issues in contemporary evolutionary theory and behavioural ecology. One of the best known examples of apparent altruism is the helping behaviour which occurs in communal breeding groups such as those found in the brown skua. Within these groups individuals often help to raise offspring which are not their own. This behaviour is an apparent enigma in a world in which organisms are assumed to act in a selfish manner. Consequently, this behaviour has become a focal example at the centre of much evolutionary debate. A variety of theories have been suggested to explain helping behaviour, the most recent is that helping is an unselected consequence of the evolution of communal breeding. This hypothesis is discussed in relation to the recent literature and it is concluded that it does little to advance the current debate. An alternative theoretical approach to helping behaviour is outlined. In conclusion the general findings from the investigation of communal breeding in the brown skua are summarised and these findings are discussed. Finally, possible areas of future research are outlined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Andr&#233; Malraux: &#201;volution de la pens&#233;e et constance du mythe profond</field><field name="creator">McGillivray, Hector</field><field name="description">The first three chapters of this thesis deal with the development of Andr&#233; Malraux's thought in the fields of politics, culture and aesthetics. In the light of Marxist thought, the writer's work as a whole shows a conception of history as fundamentally irrational and non-progressive, governed by existential forces such as the passions of nationalism and class feeling, denounced by Julien Benda. Against History as Fate, Malraux appeals ultimately to the will to consciousness, whose chosen field of expression is art, Malraux's recourse amidst a dying Western culture. The final chapter of this thesis concerns the images that haunt Malraux's work, and sets up a model of the myth underlying the conscious thought of the writer. This 'personal myth' throws light on the writer's inner world, and on the direction his intellectual thought took. Consequently, the theological function of art in Malraux's aesthetical conception stems from his unconscious personality, which gives a profound meaning and unity to the contradictions apparent in the writer.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420108 French</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--French)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2272</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nuclear arms control negotiation with special reference to New Zealand and the comprehensive Test Ban Treaty</field><field name="creator">Wilson-Roberts, Guy</field><field name="description">In 1996, at a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature. Within one week, seventy states, including all five nuclear-weapon states, signed the Treaty. This brought to an end fifty years of both nuclear tests and nuclear test-ban negotiations. For many states, the achievement of the CTBT was a major success for nuclear arms control. New Zealand played an important role in the early stages of the CTBT negotiation. Every year from 1972, New Zealand and Australia tabled a resolution in the General Assembly calling for a CTBT. After two decades of diplomacy, the resolution was adopted by consensus in 1993, allowing negotiation for a CTBT to take place in the Conference on Disarmament. Substantive negotiation for a CTBT began in 1993, but test-ban negotiations had been taking place almost since the start of nuclear testing in 1945. Like many other nuclear arms control issues, the negotiations had been dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union. Engaged in their own nuclear arms race, the two superpowers pursued their own bilateral nuclear arms control negotiations to manage their strategic relationship. Until the CTBT negotiation, multilateral nuclear arms control was mostly limited to the Treaty for the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The NPT reflected the desire of many non-nuclear states to become involved in nuclear arms control and use multilateral agreements to place obligations on the nuclear-weapon states. While both bilateral and multilateral nuclear arms control often languished due to disagreements, multilateral nuclear arms control negotiation has also dealt with the complexity of reconciling the perspectives of many states. This complexity has made the use of negotiation theories difficult, although if used pragmatically, theory can be a useful tool for the study of negotiation events. Through the test-ban resolution, New Zealand was able to contribute to the process of reaching consensus by acting as a facilitator. New Zealand is a good example of how a small non-nuclear state can make a useful contribution in multilateral nuclear arms control negotiation, typically dominated by large nuclear-weapon states, and still advance its national interests.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political studies)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A novel mucin-desulfating sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosaminidase (sulfoglycosidase) from the anaerobic colonic bacterium Prevotella strain RS2</field><field name="creator">Rho, Jung-hyun</field><field name="description">Sulfate removal from sulfomucin is believed to be a rate-limiting step in sulfomucin degradation by bacteria from the digestive tract. A novel sulfomucin-desulfating enzyme has been discovered in the anaerobic bacterium, Prevotella strain RS2, which can grow on colonic mucin as its sole energy source. The enzyme, located in the periplasm, was assayed by measuring p-nitrophenol removal from the model substrate sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine-1-p-nitrophenol, sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine being the other product. This activity differs from that of sulfatases which remove the sulfate ester group from sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine and its analogues substituted at the Cl position. The enzyme has been termed a sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosaminidase or sulfoglycosidase (SGL). The SGL was purified to a single protein band of 100 kDa as analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The purified SGL protein was trypsin-digested and peptide fragments were sequenced. PCR and inverse PCR were then used to amplify the entire sg/ gene from Prevotella strain RS2 genomic DNA. After inserting the gene into a suitable plasmid, active recombinant SGL was expressed using an Escherichia coli expression system. The SGL was characterized using a selection of model substrates, and shown to be an exo-enzyme that removes non-reducing terminal sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine residues by glycosidic bond cleavage. When tested against its putative physiological substrate, sulfomucin, the only small molecular size product detected corresponded to a sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine residue. Thus the SGL can catalyze a reaction, formerly thought to be performed in bacteria by the combined actions of a N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase and a N-acetylglucosaminidase. Inhibition studies on the SGL were carried out. Inhibitors of the SGL and those of the sulfatases were used to confirm the presence or absence of SGL-like activity in other bacteria that inhabit environments containing sulfomucin. Four isolates, including Prevotella strain RS2, of the thirteen strains tested, appeared to have SGL-like activity. This research on the SGL with its novel catalytic activity, suggests a new mechanism by which sulfomucin desulfation can occur. The physiological importance of the enzyme is postulated to be (i) to provide energy in the form of sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine, for the bacterium, (ii) to remove sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine groups present on mucin chains, thus creating or removing sites for different adhesins, and (iii) removal of inhibitory sulfate-6-N-acetylglucosamine groups from mucin chains that limit degradation of the chain by exoglycosidases and neuraminidases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Almost Runge-Kutta methods for stiff and non-stiff problems</field><field name="creator">Rattenbury, Nicolette</field><field name="description">Ordinary differential equations arise frequently in the study of the physical world. Unfortunately many cannot be solved exactly. This is why the ability to solve these equations numerically is important. Traditionally mathematicians have used one of two classes of methods for numerically solving ordinary differential equations. These are linear multistep methods and Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. General linear methods were introduced as a unifying framework for these traditional methods. They have both the multi-stage nature of Runge&#8211;Kutta methods as well as the multi-value nature of linear multistep methods. This extremely broad class of methods, besides containing Runge&#8211;Kutta and linear multistep methods as special cases, also contains hybrid methods, cyclic composite linear multistep methods and pseudo Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. In this thesis we present a class of methods known as Almost Runge&#8211;Kutta methods. This is a special class of general linear methods which retains many of the properties of traditional Runge&#8211;Kutta methods, but with some advantages. Most of this thesis concentrates on explicit methods for non-stiff differential equations, paying particular attention to a special fourth order method which, when implemented in the correct way, behaves like order five. We will also introduce low order diagonally implicit methods for solving stiff differential equations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2276</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrological impacts of urban development in the Albany Basin, Auckland</field><field name="creator">Herald, John R. (John Raymond)</field><field name="description">In several areas of Auckland, urban development has resulted in flooding and siltation problems that have been both difficult and expensive to manage. This study investigates the fluvial processes of runoff and sediment generation with a pastoral catchment of the Albany Basin and assesses the potential hydrological impacts of urban development with its catchment area. During the study period this catchment was on the fringe of the urban development of Auckland's North Shore. By examining the factors that control runoff and sediment generation within a pastoral catchment, site information that may be useful for controlling runoff and sediment generation within an urbanised Albany Basin is gained. To assess the impacts of urban development, streamflows and suspended sediment yields from catchments representative of three different land uses are compared: pastoral, urban construction and developed urban. Stream channel enlargement indices for a number of nearby catchments with different proportions of urban land cover are also determined and compared. The study shows significant increases in stormflows and suspended sediment yields from catchments that are either fully developed or undergoing construction for urban use. But due to the relatively dry weather experienced during the study period these results are thought to underestimate the impact of urbanising the Albany Basin. The investigation of stream channel enlargement shows that for totally urban catchments stream channel cross-sectional areas may be nearly three times those for pastoral catchments. Methods for controlling the impact of urban development on streamflows, sediment yields and channel enlargement are discussed. It is proposed that by developing techniques where by storm runoff is dispersed and stored within the considerable soil moisture storage capacity of an urban land cover, of the type planned for the Albany Basin, that a considerable reduction in stormflow and sediment generation may be achieved. The study concludes that through careful land use planning and the use of appropriate control structure the impacts of urban development may be reduced to acceptable levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland,1989.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2278</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tryst Tropique: Pacific Texts, Modern Sexualities</field><field name="creator">Wallace, Leonelle</field><field name="description">Tryst Tropique questions some of the assumptions that have been made about the heterosexual trajectory described by European desire as it has informed literary, artistic and anthropological representation of the South Pacific. It reads a series of contact encounters and Pacific residencies for their unfolding of European sexual inscription and discovers their inevitable entanglement with problematics of homosexual definition. This thesis arcs between two readings wherein the sexual conduct of Polynesian men both requires and escapes European definition. The first, which settles on the documents of Cook's third voyage, uses British indifference to Hawaiian sodomitical desire to help measure a representational space from whence the European homosexual will emerge (Chapter Two). The next reading considers the erotics of male visibility legible across a number of Marquesan contact texts including Herman Melville's Typee (Chapter Three). Chapter Four discovers that the suspicion of sodomitical misconduct which clouded the career of William Yate, an early nineteenth-century New Zealand missionary, continues to involve twentieth-century commentators in the interpretative dynamics of sexual entrapment. Chapter Five turns to Gauguin's Tahitian writings and paintings to engage with the place of ambivalence in contemporary analyses of colonial discourse. Chapter Six extends the parameters of the thesis in terms of gender and of geography, taking up the controversy generated by Derek Freeman around the early Samoan fieldwork of Margaret Mead. It argues that in the example of Mead's career, we can observe the way in which female sexuality acts as the cipher by which culture multiplies and maintains ignorances and knowledges across the discursive field of sex in both cosmopolitan and primitive locations. The final chapter, which analyses a contemporary documentary representation of Samoan fa'afafine, finds the pertinence or applicability of European sexual description to Polynesian behaviour again at stake, though now we find that the liberal gesture of cultural relativism is co-optable to a homophobia already drilled and proficient in erecting a difference without to forestall a difference within. Reading against the grain of much postcolonial work on the South Pacific, Tryst Tropique finds that it is the male body-whether native or European-not the female, which provides the sexual vanishing point which structures many of these narratives. In each of these Pacific moments a privileged figuration occurs: the body which stands as a placemarker for erotic capacities-both indulged and forsworn-is indicatively male. These inscriptions of masculinity betray a certain amplifying anxiety; the discrepant sexual availabilities recorded in each text break with increasing urgency on the shore of heterosexual and homosexual definition. Even as these Pacific journal keepers, these writers and artists, map identity more and more ferociously onto the known grid of gender, it seems as if the horizon of sexual certainty further and further recedes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420203 Literatures of the Pacific</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::379900 Other Studies In Human Society::379902 Indigenous studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Madness, media &amp; mental illness: a social constructionist approach</field><field name="creator">Nairn, Raymond George Ross</field><field name="description">Background Depictions of mental illnesses in the mass media have been analysed and criticised for more than forty years with little improvement, and that has serious implications for the ongoing efforts to destigmatise both mental illnesses and those who suffer from them. Aims To examine media depictions of mental illnesses within a social constructionist framework. To identify why media depictions take the form they do and to indicate ways in which such practices may be more effectively addressed. Method Items chosen from factual media genres were subjected to discourse analysis. This form of analysis attends to the preferred meaning of the items and how that meaning is constructed within the item. Exemplars of such analysis are contrasted with the content analyses more commonly performed on media materials before reporting analyses of items from everyday media reports and of materials that were expected to be less stigmatising. Results Irrespective of the form of analysis it is found that media depictions of mental illnesses are dominated by representations of dangerousness, criminal violence, unpredictability, and social incompetence. The same features were found in a destigmatisation documentary and a series of backgrounders on mental health services, in both of which madness was utilised to create interest and drama. It is argued that these characteristics occur because media personnel, like most laypersons, represent mental illnesses as forms of madness. Conclusions That my social constructionist analysis is able to account for the lack of change in media depictions over forty years. That the preference for a public mental health approach to destigmatisation is misplaced because it is unable to address the fear generated by lay understandings of mental illnesses. That the attempt to avoid conflation of the person with the disorder in Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals beginning in 1980 was an inadequate step in an appropriate direction in that it sought to remind clinicians that a mental disorder does not make a person non-human. The thesis findings are interpreted as showing that destigmatisation requires a new way of depicting mental illnesses, one that privileges the individual's experience and their ordinary humanness.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Edition of the Book of Sovereign Medicines MS X3346</field><field name="creator">Lalor, Daphne E. (Daphne Elaine)</field><field name="description">This thesis is an edition of a manuscript of medical remedies, MS X3346 (now stored in the Alexander Turnbull Library in Wellington) which belongs to the Medical Historical Society of the Auckland branch of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. The manuscript is one of five known copies of a compilation by a sixteenth century Benedictine monk, John of Feckenham, who became Abbot of Westminster during the reign of Mary Tudor. In the dedication to the manuscripts, which is almost identical in each, the Abbot states that 'This Book of Sovereign Medicines' Named for convenience throughout this edition, 'The Book of Sovereign Medicines' was collected by him for 'the poor who have not at all times the learned physicians at hand'. The scribal handwriting, and the names of various people in MS X3346, indicate that it was penned between 1665 and 1675, or about seventy-five years after Feckenham's death. Research into the life of the compiler was undertaken, as was an overview of the medical ideas of the period, together with a study of the popular genre of which the Abbot's work was an example. Also included in this thesis is a Provenance of the manuscript, a description of its state, a comparison of it with the other known copies, and the story of its donation to the Medical Historical Society. A transcript of the manuscript was prepared, maintaining the scribal spelling, punctuation and capitalization as accurately as possible. Following this, a modernized version was made, aiming at a readable text. The layout of the original manuscript and the transcript was maintained as far as possible, to facilitate keying of annotations and comments to the text. The Oxford English Dictionary was used as the standard for spelling and grammar, and an attempt was made to conform to the principles used by Stanley Wells and Gary Taylor in the compact edition of Shakespeare's Complete Works. A glossary was prepared defining herbs, ingredients, medical terms and so on. Annotations to the remedies indicate the same or similar examples in other works, especially in the Folger edition of 'This Booke of Sovereigne Medicines' (edited by E.R.Macgill in 1990). Also in the annotations are explanations of words and phrases specific to a remedy, and identification of many of the people mentioned in the work. Quotations from authors of the time of Chaucer to the modern day are included in the glossary and annotations to help define and illustrate medical terms and ingredients perhaps not familiar today. Early herbals were studied, especially those of William Turner and John Gerard. As Eleanour Sinclair Rohde (The Old English Herbals, p.98) has pointed out, Gerard was justly condemned by critics of his own time as well as modern ones for 'having used Dr Priest's translation of Dodoen's &#9090;Pemptades&#9089; without acknowledgement'. Nevertheless, this editor, like Rohde, has found such pleasure in Gerard&#8217;s delightful language, his descriptions of plants, with their habitats and their virtues, that many quotations from his Herball have been included. There is an index of authors and quotations, and also a general index to the contents of the modern version.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420101 English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Currie Commission and Report on Education in New Zealand 1960-1962</field><field name="creator">Scott, David John, 1946-</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates and analyses the Report of the Commission on Education in New Zealand,1962, also known as the 'Currie Report', paying particular attention to the policy process surrounding the written and oral submissions. Views expressed during the submissions and their ideological basis are related to wider power relationships within society. The submissions emanating from outside the Department of Education are revisited as well as the departmental submissions to establish whether there are any grounds to challenge the consensual, liberal interpretations that have been attached to this important New Zealand historical educational document. The issues raised and avoided in the submissions coalesce around specific themes, which are related to the broader issues of the development of New Zealand educational history. Attempts to counteract, mute and marginalise dissent and to encourage optimal social control are witnessed in the organizational structure of the commission and in its methods. The interaction and networking of key participants is studied and the important inter-relationship between central bureaucratic interventions and powerful educational pressure group activity points to the continuing operational success of central government processes. The often competing forces of provincialism and centralism in New Zealand education underlie many of the conflicts surrounding educational change. Religion, race, gender and class are forces that continually interact to create legitimation crises. The governmental attempt to minimise or at least rationalize these socially contested differences in education from 1960-1962 is the subject of this thesis. An analysis is made of the process by which public dissatisfaction regarding education in the fifties and sixties was mediated and largely marginalised by the educational bureaucracy. This is done by a thorough examination of the interaction of pressure groups, unions, media and governmental agencies during the two year submissions to the Commission on Education 1962. The distinction between the commission's report and the submissions and interrogations leading up to the report is important, as the primary data extracted from the primary resource material in the submissions, at times, contradicts the departmental view as expressed in the report itself. In this way it is hoped to move beyond the rhetoric that informs previous commentaries and move closer to an interpretation based upon the primary data.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2283</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of ethyl cellulose based grafting copolymers</field><field name="creator">Zheng, Betty Qilan</field><field name="description">Copolymerisation of ethyl cellulose (EC) with methyl methacrylate (MMA) and vinyl acetate was carried out in solution, using a number of free radical initiators, to form graft copolymers with grafting yields up to 63% and weight average molecular weight about 9 x 104 g mol-1 Graft copolymerisation of MMA and EC appears to involve participation of comonomer charge transfer complexes at the initial stage of reaction, Interaction of EC with the carbonyl group of MMA enhances the electron-accepting ability of EC and promotes the formation of a donor-acceptor complex as matrix, with the resultant generation of a covalent bonded monomer radical, which then propagates in the usual manner to produce EC-g-PMMA. The influence of a number of experimental variables on the grafting efficiency of the EC-g-PMMA reaction, and the properties of the resulting copolymers, was investigated. The initiator has a significant effect on the grafting efficiency, which decreases in the order azobisisobutyronitril&gt;ammonium persulphate&gt;potassium persulphate&gt;Ce(IV) ion. Benzoyl peroxide was found to be unsuitable because it promoted degradation of ethyl cellulose chains. The order of solvent influence on the grafting yield is chloroform&gt;toluene&gt;benzene. The grafting yield is also reaction time and temperature dependent. A2-3 hour reaction time and 40-50&#176;C reaction temperature gives a substantial increase in both reaction rate and the molecular weight of the graft copolymer product. The introduction of PMMA graft side chains onto EC main chains leads to a significant decrease in the radius of gyration in solution, as determined by size exclusion chromatography, compared to linear EC. This finding is explained by the theory of Stockmayer and Fixman in terms of the number and type of long chain graft points in the molecule, Calculation of viscosity of EC-g-PMMA in solution using the Kurata equation gave values in good agreement with the experimentally determined viscosity. A significant result is that grafting PMMA branches onto EC reduces the hydrodynamic volume, and differential scanning calorimetry showed conclusively that increasing PMMA sidechain length reduces the chain flexibility, by reduction of free volume. The glass transition temperature of EC-g-PMMA, produced by using a large excess of MMA monomer and reasonably long reaction time, was shifted to higher temperature with increase of grafting yield and molecular weight. A single glass transition is observed for copolymers made using low initiator concentrations, and two glass transitions are found for higher initiator concentrations. In addition, EC-g-PMMA samples with higher grafting yield are more brittle than those with lower grafting yield. However, both the bending modulus (determined by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) and elongation at break increase with grafting yield. Our experiments proved that the crystallinity of EC-g-PMMA is less than that of pure EC and greater than that of pure amorphous PMMA. The specific oxygen gas-permeability coefficients of EC-g-PMMA films decrease with increase of grafting yield. The reason is that grafting decreases of hydrodynamic volume. Interestingly, X-ray diffraction showed that the higher the grafting yields of EC-g-PMMA, the higher its crystallinity. Films of EC-blend-PMMA, made by solution casting and examined in cross section using scanning electron microscopy, showed an essentially multiple layer morphology with non-uniform dispersion of PMMA in the EC matrix. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed, as expected, that EC-g-PMMA cast films were homogeneous with no evidence of phase separation. The tensile strength of EC-g-PMMA films was typically about 20% higher than that of EC-blend-PMMA films, and the graft copolymer films exhibited greater oxygen permeability. A new model for graft copolymerisation to EC is proposed. The model provides for the possibility that grafting to EC with 48% ethoxy content can occur at the five OC2H5 groups and one OH group per unit. It was established using NMR spectrometry of EC-g-PMMA and EC-g-Poly (vinyl acetate) that under some conditions the ethoxy groups are the favoured graft sites. The liquid crystalline properties of EC and EC-g-PMMA were extensively investigated. Optical microscopy with crossed polarisers revealed that the relatively short mesomorphic temperature range of ethyl cellulose is extended downwards almost to ambient temperature in the graft copolymer. Low frequency Raman scattering showed that EC-g-PMMA has higher light scattering intensity than EC at ambient temperature. But it was lower than that of EC at 191&#176;C. Moreover, the Jaynes-Cummings model cannot predict the light scattering intensity of EC-g-PMMA as a function of frequency very well, whereas the EIT-Kerr scheme is able to successfully account for the experimental observations. It was found that EC and EC-g-PMMA are pseudoplastic, lyotropic and thermotropic materials whose viscosity in solution is dependent on many factors, particularly on temperature and solution concentration. Both materials show unusual rheological behaviour, including maxima in the isothermal concentration dependence of viscosity. Unmodified EC exhibits thixotropic flow behaviour, whereas grafting PMMA side chains onto EC changes the flow behaviour to rheopectic, which is also typical of PMMA itself. As the temperature and concentration increase, the viscosity increases in response to the transition from an isotropic to an anisotropic state of EC-g-PMMA. Furthermore, experiments on the distinguishing characteristics of EC-g-PMMA indicate that different solvents affect its anisotropic flow behaviour to a greater or lesser extent. In particular, chloroform shows a stronger flow orientation effect than tetrachloroethane on EC-g-PMMA solutions. The rheological behaviour of EC and EC-g-PMMA in the nematic phase is much more complex than that of ordinary polymers or low molecular weight liquid crystals. The Doi theory is usually applicable to ordinary polymers or low molecular weight liquid crystals, but cannot predict shear stress as a function of shear rate; particularly at very low shear rates for EC and EC-g-PMMA. Whereas, the polydomain model is better to account for the observations. Measurements of thermally stimulated depolarisation current showed that EC-g-PMMA has a longer dipolar relaxation time in an electrical field. Molecular dipole motions of EC give a maximum depolarisation current at 138 &#176;C in the glass transition region and another maximum near 200 &#176;C, corresponding to dipolar relaxation in the liquid crystalline phase. EC-g-PMMA shows a broader dipolar relaxation temperature range in the liquid crystalline phase and the depolarisation current maximum shifts to a lower temperature. We have observed that field induced polarisation of EC-g-PMMA is affected by the length of the PMMA side chain, and obeys an interfacial model of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars type. It was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy that the length of the PMMA side chain could affect the surface properties. EC-g-PMMA has higher photoemission intensity than EC, and the photoemission intensity and depolarisation current increase with grafting yield.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alienated by Evolution: The Educational Implications of Creationist and Social Darwinist Reactions in New Zealand to the Darwinian Theory of Evolution</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Bill</field><field name="description">This investigation explores the reactions to Darwinism in the format and informal education of New Zealand society. The subsidiary purpose is to look at some implications for formal education. Many of the reactions have focussed on distortions of the Darwinian theory of evolution with the form of reaction to Darwinism being centred on different views of humankind. The various group interests have caused different aspects of Darwinism to be highlighted particularly when groups feel their interests are under threat. Using aspects of an "HS3" historical survey technique i.e. the history of the public reaction to an aspect of science and science teaching, key features of this debate are set in context. This context is then used to show that creationist objections and social Darwinian interpretations share many characteristics with their overseas counterparts. A philosophical analysis of the positions taken supports a charge that New Zealand creationist science is partly non science, and partly bad science. It is also shown that confusion has been created when groups have debated issues from different perspectives including cultural perspectives. In particular there has been a lack of communication as various creationist groups, using different research bases, and political, economic and legal institutions, have adopted generalist conservative positions, highlighted metaphysical and ethical considerations and drawn on creationist science literature to support the science of their case while pro-evolutionist groups have adopted specialist liberal or progressive positions, concentrated on the logic and epistemology of the debate and have drawn on mainstream science literature. Finally some implications have been drawn from this analysis of the different reactions, and recommendations have been made for future teaching of evolution and related concepts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2286</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tokelauan syntax studies in the sentence structure of a Polynesian language</field><field name="creator">Sharples, Peter R.</field><field name="description">A fairly comprehensive treatment of the main features of Tokelauan sentence structure is the central aim. The syntactic analysis is presented within a framework which is an adaptation of Chomsky's 'Standard Theory' but special consideration is given to the problem of squaring a grammar based on formal evidence with a functionally-based analysis of sentences. The principal modification to the Standard Theory is the readoption of kernel sentences and generalized transformations, i.e. a partial reversion to the transformational model proposed in Chomsky's Syntactic Structures. Thus, the output of the base rules is a set of simple sentence structures, with no embeddings. The treatment of other aspects of Tokelauan included in this analysis are described below in a brief synopsis of each chapter. Chapter 1 is introductory, serving to locate the language, place and the people of Tokelau. Previous discussions of the position of Tokelauan within the Polynesian group are reviewed, and a basic vocabulary list is provided together with Cognate percentages shared by Tokelauan of Samoan, Nanumean Ellice and Sikaiana. The aims and scope of this analysis are then discussed in the context of a brief survey of earlier syntactic studies of Polynesian languages, and of the various grammatical models applied to Polynesian or developed in recent theoretical work on syntax and semantics. Chapters 2 and 3 are essentially referential, presenting lists of all the grammatical elements and rules to be discussed in later chapters. Chapter 2 has two parts. In Part 1 the segmental phonemes of Tokelauan are described, along with the practical problems associated with the choice of orthographic symbols. In Part 2 the functor (grammatical) morphemes of Tokelauan are listed and their uses exemplified. Chapter 3 lists the categorial rules of the base component and some transformational rules. Chapters 4-6 discuss evidence for and against the formal analysis outlined in 3. Chapter 4 treats the major categorial (phrase structure) rules, stating the procedures used to determine immediate constituents, and defending potentially controversial parts of the analysis against alternatives. Formal and functional analyses are made independently, then compared. In Chapter 5, certain transformational rules of Tokelauan are examined with illustrative examples. The final chapter is in two distinct but related parts. First the grounds on which Hohepa based his ergative-accusative classification of Polynesian languages are summarised, and reviewed in relation to the evidence of Tokelauan. One result is a rejection of the concepts of direct object (and so, of transitivity) and of an active-passive transformation a s significant grammatical relations in Tokelauan. The later sections examine certain functional relations associated with the constituent analysis of sentences particularly the functions of case markers. This exercise provides a framework for verb classification in Tokelauan.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2288</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High Current Anodization of Magnesium and Magnesium Alloys</field><field name="creator">Carter, Ellen Angharad</field><field name="description">High current anodization of magnesium and magnesium alloys Ellen Angharad Carter Pure magnesium and three magnesium alloys containing different amounts of aluminium (2-9%) plus zinc and manganese were anodized with constant current density in sodium hydroxide solution with and without fluoride or phosphate ions. Electric field strengths of resultant anodic films were calculated from galvanostatic transients. These transients showed three characteristic features: linear voltage increase, noisy high voltage signals accompanied by sparking, and sawtooth-like events characterized by instantaneous voltage drops followed by slower voltage increases. Each feature was linked to certain physical processes occurring in the metal/film/solution system. Oxidation of magnesium and magnesium alloys formed anodic films with bilayer structures: a passive barrier layer adhering to the metal electrode, topped by a porous secondary layer. Cation injection into the barrier film across the metal/oxide interface was the rate determining step for film growth. Interstitial cations migrated through the film under the influence of the electric field. At the film/solution interface they reacted with electrolyte species and either thickened the film or dissolved in solution. Electric field strength was constant for particular metal/solution combinations and was independent of applied current density. Changing the electrode material altered the resultant electric field strength: pure magnesium produced oxides with lower electric field strengths than films formed on the three magnesium alloys. Changing the electrolyte had no discernable effect on the electric field strength. Charge efficiency of the film growth process was investigated by oxygen gas evolution; efficiency decreased during sparking. Ion beam analysis (Rutherford backscattering, fluorine depth profiling and nuclear reaction analysis) coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction studies and Raman spectroscopy gave information about the anodic film surface. These techniques showed that oxides formed on magnesium-aluminium alloys were thinner than those formed on pure magnesium caused by aluminium dissolution. Fluorine depth profiling revealed that concentration profiles for fluorine in anodic oxides formed in fluoride-containing solution altered depending on the aluminium content of the electrode material.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in Tokelauan syntax</field><field name="creator">Hooper, Robin</field><field name="description">This thesis is composed of separate studies of aspects of Tokelauan syntax. They are united by an emphasis on the relation between linguistic forms and communicative functions, and in particular on the semantics and pragmatics of grammatical categories. Chapter 1, 'Outline of the main structures of Tokelauan' forms a background for the more intensive studies of later chapters. After short sections on phonology, morphology and word classes, I describe the composition of noun phrases and verb phrases, the pronoun system, and the internal structure and semantics of nominalisations. The final two sections cover a number of aspects of the structure of the simple sentence, including predicate types, verb classes, and clause types, and review the main types of complex sentence. Chapter 2, &#8217;Tense and aspect', presents a discourse-based analysis of this area of syntax. Section 1 outlines the theoretical basis of the analysis of Tokelauan tense-aspect categories which is presented in the following two sections. I then extend the analysis to a particular discourse type, oral Tokelauan narrative. The final section takes a typological approach, considering whether the particle kua can be regarded as a member of a cross-linguistic category of Perfect. Chapter 3, &#8216;The discourse functions of focus constructions&#8217;, looks at a number of Tokelauan constructions involving clause-initial noun phrases which clearly have the pragmatic force of focusing, but in some of which the distribution of given and new information is not of the expected kind. Since clause-initial noun phrases are used for other discourse functions which can be grouped under the heading of topicalisation, the chapter concludes with some comments on this matter in section 2. Chapter 4, &#8216;The syntax of complementation&#8217;, attempts in the first three sections a comprehensive description of Tokelauan complement types and of the semantic classes of complement-taking predicates. Section 4 is concerned with the syntax and semantics of complementizers, and sections 5 with reduced complements of the kind which have been associated with the terms equi-deletion and raising. The final section assesses the overall nature of the Tokelauan complementation system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes of sedimentation on the shoreface and continental shelf and the development of facies Pakiri, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Michael John</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents the results of research of physical and biological processes of sedimentation on the shoreface and continental shelf in Pakiri Bay, on the east coast of the Northland Peninsu1a, New Zealand. These environments comprise the subtidal portion of the Pakiri sand body. Sand bodies that are contiguous with unconsolidated sediments of coastal barriers are characteristic of the embayed east coasts of the Auckland and Northland Regions, yet little is known of their geomorphology. Existing models of shoreface and shelf sedimentation afford limited assistance because they were developed in different environments. Factors that distinguish the study area from other coasts include tectonic stability, lack of modern (non-biogenic) sediment inputs, the predominance of currents related to shoaling surface waves, and a sea level stillstand for the last 6,500 years. The model of sedimentation developed is derived from intensive field investigation of the morphology, sedimentology and ecology of the Pakiri Bay shoreface and continental shelf. Investigations of sediment transport entail interpretations of the sediments and sedimentary structures of the seabed, application of existing sediment transport models and the analysis of morphodynamic data. The geomorphology of the Pakiri sediment body is characterized by a regular pattern of morphologic components and associated sediment types. Alongshore variation in these characteristics is generally minor compared with shore normal variation. The shoreface comprises a curvilinear concave surface, that extends offshore from the alongshore bar approximately 1500 m, to water depths of about 22 n. The inner continental shelf comprises an equally curvilinear, mostly convex, surface that slopes seaward to the relatively flat middle continental shelf. Secondary morphological variations result from the presence of large-scale bedforms on the middle continental shelf and landward margin of the inner shelf. The sediments of the shoreface are fine, very well sorted quartz-feldspathic sands of 2 &#248; mean grain size. The inner shelf sediments grade offshore from a medium sand to very coarse sands and fine gravels (mean grain size 0.0 to 0.5 &#248;). In contrast the sediments of the mid shelf are very fine sands (mean grain size 2.0 to 2.5 &#248;), with a mud content of 5 to l0 percent. Carbonate skeletal debris, derived mostly from molluscs, comprises a significant proportion of inner and mid shelf sediments. The concentration of carbonates in the sediments increases offshore from 0 to 5 percent on the shoreface to 30 percent at the base of the inner shelf. The carbonate fraction of the sediments is size graded on the inner shelf and mid shelf in accordance with the grain size characteristics of the non-carbonate fraction. A model of the distribution and abundance of living macrobenthos (mostly of the phyla mollusca) is derived from benthos surveys in Pakiri Bay. Species that are diagnostic of high and low energy environments are characteristic of the shoreface and middle continental shelf respectively. The pattern of carbonate concentration in the sediments of the subtidal sediment body does not correlate with the pattern of modern biogenic production. Highest levels of modern shell production occur across the shoreface, whereas carbonate concentrations are greatest at the base of the inner shelf. Hypotheses are advanced to explain this dichotomy. The geomorphology of the shoreface and inner continental shelf is seen as a response to modern processes of sedimentation. Sediment transport occurs primarily in response to currents related to shoaling waves. Two process regimes are recognized. During typically calm (swe11 wave) conditions the fine sands of the shoreface may be transported landward as a result of an onshore mass transport current. During severe storm events this process may transport bed sediments landward across the inner shelf and middle continental shelf forming the characteristic sediment and morphologic patterns observed. However, during such events this onshore flow is, probably counteracted by return flows that are able to transport eroded foreshore and inshore sediments seaward Key words: Sedimentation, shoreface, continental shelf, wave dominated, carbonated sedimentation, sediment body, facies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland,1990.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2294</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structural Studies of Prostratin and of Oxalate Bridging</field><field name="creator">McCormick, Ross</field><field name="description">This thesis is presented in three parts.

The effect of the change in the redox-state of the compounds was determined by vibrational spectroscopic and molecular orbital techniques. The investigation of 2,7-dimethylthieno[2,3-c:5,4-c'] dipyridinium diiodide monohydrate was undertaken by X-ray diffraction, vibrational spectroscopic and molecular-orbital techniques. These investigations showed that the thiophenic portion of the dication exhibited partial aromaticity. On formation of the radical monocation, a pattern of bond length changes consistent with the formation of a quinoidal structure was predicted by molecular-orbital calculations. This suggests that the electron delocalisation occurs over the entire molecule. The resonance Raman spectrum of the cation monoradical exhibits bands which may be assigned to the thiophenic portion, which suggests that this portion is associated with the chromophore. IR spectroscopic investigations into the electrogenerated radical of N,N'-diheptyl 4,4' - pyridinium, which has been investigated as the coloured component of electrochromic displays, were performed. The reflectance IR spectra of the radical monocations were obtained through bulk-sampling potential subtraction (PS) and surface-selective polarisation modulation (PM) techniques. The comparison between PS and PM spectra of the radical generated as a solid film in an aqueous medium, with the PS spectrum of the radical generated in acetonitrile revealed differences. These were interpreted in terms of an equilibrium between monomeric and aggregated forms of the radical. Similar results were obtained for the related compounds, methyl viologen and its dicyano substituted salt. The simplicity in the pattern of bands in the PS IR spectra of the monomeric radicals of methyl- and dicyanomethyl viologens was investigated by calculating the IR spectra of the dications and cation radicals of these compounds by molecular orbital techniques. The intense spectral features could be interpreted in terms of a charge-oscillation of the radical electron across the pyridine rings. The dipole moment of such modes is large and leads to the enhancement of these modes. The effect of various counterions associated with heptyl viologen was investigated by Raman and IR techniques. The pattern of bands in the Raman spectrum exhibited little variation with differing the counterions. The PS IR spectra exhibited disappearance features associated with the counterion in contrast to the PM spectra where no such bands were observed. PS IR spectra were also obtained by synchronising data acquisition with potential sweeps. The intensity of disappearance features in the PS IR spectra attributable to the CH modes varied at a similar rats to bands assigned to the radical aggregate. This suggested that a reorientation of the dipyridine ring and the quaternising alkyl chain probably occurs on reduction to form the radical. The lack of reversibility associated with the degradation of viologen films was investigated by PS IR techniques. The effect is probably associated with changes in the composition of the solid rather than a change in the concentrations of the monomeric and aggregated forms of the viologen radical. Dialkyl bridged diquaternary compounds of 2,2'-dipyridine were investigated by IR and theoretical techniques. The observation that the calculated dihedral angles for the dications and cation radicals were similar allowed the trends in the electronic absorption maxima (ultra-violet) and electrode potentials to be interpreted. Selective enhancements of bands in the PS IR spectra of the radicals suggest that a charge-oscillation mechanism may also be operative in these compounds. The utility of a combination of structural, theoretical and vibrational spectroscopic studies is demonstrated in these studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The soil seed bank in Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl. (kauri) forests of northern New Zealand and its potential role in secondary successions</field><field name="creator">Sem, Graham</field><field name="description">The soil seed bank in Agathis australis (D. Don) Lindl. (kauri) forests of northern New Zealand is quantified, and its potential role in secondary successions examined. Seed bank data from a number of kauri forest sites stratified by successional time and distance from forest edges are summarized using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (ordination) and linear regression models. A number of issues concerning secondary successions and the soil seed bank are discussed. These include: 1. The relationship between the soil seed bank and extant vegetation. 2. The nature of the soil seed bank and successional time. 3. The nature of the soil seed bank and distance from forest edges. 4. The soil seed bank, canopy gaps and gap regeneration strategies. 5. The nature of the soil seed bank and soil properties. 6. The fruiting phenology, seed rain, and soil seed bank dynamics. The forest sites ranged from 50 years to over 1,000 years old, while distance from forest edges ranged from 0.2 km to 3.5 km. Soil seed bank densities under kauri forests were 134 - 5,388 seeds m-2 with a mean density of 1,320&#177;217 seeds m-2 which is similar to estimates reported for temperate and tropical forest sites elsewhere. The spatial distribution of seeds in the seed bank both within and between sites is highly variable. A total of 6,062 seedlings emerged from the seed bank samples. This represented 62 vascular plant species, 26 (42%) native woody, 19 (30%) native weedy, 16 (26) adventive weedy and 1 (2%) native fern. The species composition of the soil seed bank was not closely related to extant vegetation and only 11%ot canopy and 13% of understorey species were represented in the soil seed bank. Thus, 77% of extant vegetation at any given site is floristically different from that of the soil seed bank. Ordination of the data by detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) suggested that extant vegetation (canopy and understorey) and the soil seed bank contain characteristic floras. The species composition of the seed bank is variable between sites. The viable seed pool is larger under young successional forests than under older mature forests. The number of species also declined with distance from forest edges. Adventive and native weedy species were found in seed banks under mature forests and sites of considerable distances from forest edges. However, the density of the weedy species component of the soil seed bank was at least partly determined by distance from forest edges where such species are common. While buried seed is likely to contribute to the early stages of secondary succession, evidence from canopy gaps suggested that the seedling bank (formerly suppressed understorey component) is more important in gap regeneration than the soil seed bank. DCA analysis revealed that seedling bank species composition of canopy gaps and forest sites were quite different from the soil seed banks, indicating that regeneration stemmed from formerly (suppressed) understorey seedlings. Phenology and seed rain study of a mature forest remnant and a regenerating forest community showed that as little as 5% of the seed input to the forest floor enters the soil seed bank and remains viable for more than one year. Evidence is presented to suggest that in a forest community, secondary succession after large-scale or localised disturbance, is achieved more so by suppressed seedlings and recent seed rain than the soil seed bank. The soil seed bank becomes significant in secondary succession when the subsoil is disturbed by the uprooting of trees or the forest floor is exposed by tree-fall (not covered by tree-fall debris).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::269900 Other Earth Sciences::269901 Physical geography</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1991.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Design and Verification of a Cryptographic Security Architecture</field><field name="creator">Gutmann, Peter</field><field name="description">A cryptographic security architecture constitutes the collection of hardware and software which protects and controls the use of encryption keys and similar cryptovariables. This thesis presents a design for a portable, flexible high-security architecture based on a traditional computer security model. Behind the API it consists of a kernel implementing a reference monitor which controls access to security-relevant objects and attributes based on a configurable security policy. Layered over the kernel are various objects which abstract core functionality such as encryption and digital signature capabilities, certificate management and secure sessions and data enveloping (email encryption). The kernel itself uses a novel design which bases its security policy on a collection of filter rules enforcing a cryptographic module-specific security policy. Since the enforcement mechanism (&amp;e kernel) is completely independent of the policy database (the filter rules), it is possible to change the behaviour of the architecture by updating the policy database without having to make any changes to the kernel itself. This clear separation of policy and mechanism contrasts with current cryptographic security architecture approaches which, if they enforce controls at all, hardcode them into the implementation, making it difficult to either change the controls to meet application-specific requirements or to assess and verify them. To provide assurance of the correctness of the implementation, this thesis presents a design and implementation process which has been selected to allow the implementation to be verified in a manner which can reassure an outsider that it does indeed function as required. In addition to producing verification evidence which is understandable to the average user, the verification process for an implementation needs to be fully automated and capable of being taken down to the level of running code, an approach which is currently impossible with traditional methods. The approach presented here makes it possible to perform verification at this level, something which had previously been classed as "beyond Al" (that is, not achievable using any known technology). The versatility of the architecture presented here has been proven through its use in implementations ranging from l6-bit microcontrollers through to supercomputers, as well as a number of unusual areas such as security modules in ATMs and cryptographic coprocessors for general-purpose computers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::280000 Information, Computing and Communication Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Computer Science)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enzyme activities associated with gonadotropic hormones</field><field name="creator">Daja, Mirella Maria</field><field name="description">A structural relationship between gonadotropic hormones and certain types of enzymes has been suggested in previous studies and an investigation into the possibility of enzymatic activity associated with the gonadotropic hormones has been the primary focus of the research presented in this thesis. Partial sequence homology between human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and &#945;-chymotrypsin prompted the recent proposal of a tertiary structure of hCG using &#945;-chymotrypsin as a folding template, which suggested the possibility of intrinsic peptidase activity associated with hCG. Highly purified hCG (CR127) was assayed for enzymatic activity against a range of synthetic peptide substrates and was found to exhibit Arg-specific peptidase activity. This activity was almost completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), soybean trypsin inhibitor (STI), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) and to a lesser extent by N-&#945;-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), which indicated that the observed protease activity was serine protease-like. To establish whether this activity was intrinsic to the hormone or due to contaminants, extensive purification procedures were carried out. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) and soybean trypsin inhibitor-affinity chromatography were found to effectively separate the protease activity from the hormone, indicating the presence of exogenous protease contaminants in the highly purified preparation of hCG. Further analysis by [3H]-DFP labelling of hCG and SDS-PAGE of the isolated contaminants revealed the presence of possible serine proteases with apparent molecular masses of 60 and 20 kD. Because serine proteases are known to stimulate cAMP production in the same target cells, it was necessary to determine the effects of the contaminating proteases on the receptor binding of hCG and cAMP production. The presence of these contaminants was found to have no apparent effect on the receptor binding capability of hCG, however the in vitro biological activity of hCG as determined by maximal cAMP production was decreased after HIC-HPLC purification of the hormone. These observations suggested that the serine protease-like contaminants contributed to the total cAMP production, thereby introducing significant error in biological assays that use hCG (CR127). The possible intrinsic enzymatic activity of hCG against its receptor as a natural substrate was further investigated. A membrane-bound receptor preparation was isolated from porcine ovaries and a receptor binding assay successfully established. The effects of hCG binding upon the membrane-bound receptor were studied and receptor proteolysis was observed. However, this proteolysis could not be definitively attributed to the actions of hCG. A purified receptor was subsequently prepared by hCG-affinity chromatography and analysed by SDS-PAGE with detection by autoradiography and silver staining. The purified receptor was found to have undergone proteolysis during the purification procedure, presumably following incubation with the hCG affinity matrix. Recent reports of the presence of homologous amino acid sequences in the active site of thioredoxin and the &#946;-subunit of the gonadotropic hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and subsequent demonstration of thioredoxin-like activity associated with these hormones, prompted an investigation into the possibility of thioredoxin-like activity associated with hCG. LH, FSH and hCG were all assayed for their ability to promote reactivation of reduced and denatured RNase. Although LH was shown to be capable of reactivating reduced RNase, the level of activity detected was significantly lower than that previously reported, whereas FSH and hCG were not found to be capable of this thioredoxin-like activity. These results suggested that the previously reported thioredoxin-like activity may be due to contamination of the hormone preparation, by the ubiquitous enzyme thioredoxin. The possibility of LH possessing intrinsic dithiol-disulphide interchange activity was investigated further using [3H]-iodoacetic acid. RNase/LH were incubated in an attempt to quench a dithiol intermediate. Preliminary results suggested that the presence of LH in this reaction increased the amount of protein radiolabelled, however, the isolation of a radiolabelled dithiol intermediate which could be conclusively identified as LH was not forthcoming. Furthermore the lack of RNase reactivation activity in hCG, suggests that the putative thioredoxin-like activity of LH, if intrinsic, may not be involved in receptor activation and/or signal transduction, as hCG and LH share the same receptor and should therefore have a similar mechanism of activation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Translation and understanding: mental models as an interface in the process of translation</field><field name="creator">Kikuchi, Atsuko</field><field name="description">This thesis discusses two characteristics of language which affect translation, using English and Japanese examples. However, the general points made in the thesis are not specific to these two languages. One characteristic of language is that it encodes particular perceptions of experience by its users. Word meaning is defined in this thesis in terms of the typical experience the language user associates with a word. Concepts for which there are no single lexical items are encoded by putting together words which the speaker thinks best characterise the concept. This particular characterisation of a concept may become established in the language community. If the members of a language community form a habit of characterising a concept in a particular way, it may become difficult to perceive the concept in any other way. In translation, this may lead the translator to impose characterizations established in her own language on the other language. However, such difficulties can be overcome because of the creative capacity of people everywhere to learn new ways to perceive the world. And language provides the mechanism to encode such novel perception. This is the other characteristic of language discussed in this thesis. We can use an existing word to encode a new kind of experience which we perceive as having some connection with the kind of experience associated with the word. Such novel application of a word can be understood because upon hearing the word, the typical experience associated with the word is evoked in the hearer's mind, and using her knowledge, the hearer constructs a mental model which she thinks best accounts for the combination of experiences evoked in her mind by the linguistic forms. Defining word meaning and sentence meaning in terms of mental images allows us to understand the process of translation: Upon hearing/reading the source language text, the translator constructs a mental model based on the text. She then bases her translation on this mental model, which becomes a rich source of information. Because the translator is not moving directly from one language to the other, no direct correspondences between the linguistic forms of the two languages need to be sought. This also explains why it is relatively easy to translate between two languages whose users share similar experiences and therefore can build similar mental models, even if the languages are typologically very different from each other.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies::420115 Japanese</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Linguistics)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into kiwifruit</field><field name="creator">Janssen, Bart-Jan</field><field name="description">A system has been developed to aid in the establishment of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation for new plant species. A series of binary vectors have been constructed that express a chimaeric &#946;-D-glucuronidase (GUS) gene in plants cells but not in bacterial cells. This feature allows GUS activity from transformed plant cells to be assayed in the presence of Agrobacterium. Preliminary experiments examined the expression of these chimaeric GUS genes in transformed petunia leaf discs. GUS expression was detectable 2 days after inoculation, peaked at 3 &#8211; 4 days and then declined; if selection was imposed expression increased again after 10 - 14 days. The amount of expression observed 4 days after inoculation correlated well with stable integration as measured by kanamycin resistance, hormone independence, and gall formation. Histochemical staining of inoculated leaf discs confirmed the transient peak of GUS expression 3 - 4 days after inoculation. Surprisingly, GUS expression was concentrated in localized zones on the circumference of the disc; within these zones essentially all the cells appeared to be expressing GUS. These results suggest that the frequency of gene transfer from Agrobacterium is extremely high within localized regions of the petunia leaf explants, but that the frequency of stable integration is several orders of magnitude lower. A reliable Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system has been established for kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa var. deliciosa cv. Hayward) by using transient expression of GUS to monitor gene transfer frequencies. In vitro culture of kiwifruit plants and conditions for regeneration of plants from leaf discs have been established. Several factors were found to improve gene transfer frequencies in kiwifruit: (i) healthy actively growing source tissue; (ii) the use of Agrobacterium strain A281; (iii) the presence of a layer of moistened filter paper between the leaf explants and the cocultivation media; and (iv) the presence of 20 &#956;M acetosyringone in both the bacterial culture media and in the cocultivation media. Pre-culture of leaf explants significantly inhibited gene transfer, particularly at the cut edge of the explants. Using the optimized transformation system, at least one transgenic plant can be regenerated from each leaf inoculated. Stable transformation frequencies have been shown to vary significantly between different binary vectors. Phenotypic, PCR, and Southern analysis has confirmed the presence of stably integrated T-DNA in several transgenic kiwifruit plants.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cellular and Molecular Biology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2313</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Namakir: a description of a central Vanuatu language</field><field name="creator">Sperlich, Wolfgang B., 1948-</field><field name="description">This is a description of the phonology, morphology and syntax of Namakir, a language of the Oceanic subgroup of Austronesian, which is spoken on some six small islands of the Shepherd Islands, central Vanuatu. My perspective on Namakir is that of a person trained in linguistics, who carried out linguistic fieldwork for the purpose of grammatical description. In addition I contributed to ethnographic work as well as compiling data for a dictionary, part of which is appended to the present description. Namakir is a conservative language which retains many features that make Oceanic languages unique. Thus it is a valuable witness for comparative and reconstructive work in Oceanic linguistics. The physical, social and historical setting of Namakir is detailed in the introductory chapter. A section on theoretical issues concerning the descriptive enterprise is included. The chapter on phonology outlines the Namakir consonant and vowel inventories, with due emphasis on the glottal stop which, as a reflex of the Proto-Oceanic glottal stop, is a unique occurence in Vanuatu languages Sections on phonotactics, stress and phonological processes add to the basic description of segments. In the chapter on morphophonemics the dynamics of derivational processes are explored. A major section deals with consonant alternation, a phenomenon widely discussed in Oceanic Linguistics. The major form classes are detailed in the next chapter. Nominals, determiners, adjectives, verbs and adverbs are established as word categories and paradigm tables are provided for comprehensive overviews. The last chapter on Namakir syntax provides a systematic description of noun phrase and verb phrase. Possessive constructions receive special attention as they exhibit a number of unusual features. The verb phrase is discussed within the framework of the Oceanic definition of verb and periphery which include subject markers as well as pronominal objects. The Namakir mood and aspectual system is presented in detail. A major section deals with serial verb constructions in relation to current descriptive theories. The concluding sections discuss selected items regarding complex sentence structures. Negation and question sentences, existential and comparative sentence types are included. Coordination together with direct and indirect speech is noted to use forms of a quotative verb, being especially significant in the organisation of narrative sequences. Relative and temporal clauses share a single overt marker. A morpheme-to-morpheme glossed narrative is appended to demonstrate narrative style. A substantial Namakir-English-Bislama wordlist is added as a repository of data collected during fieldwork.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380200 Linguistics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Linguistics)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Children's Writing in New Zealand Newspapers, 1930s and 1980s</field><field name="creator">Holt, Jill</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of writing by New Zealand children in the Children's Pages of five New Zealand newspapers: the New Zealand Herald, Christchurch Press and Otago Daily Times in the 1930s and 1980s, the Dominion in the 1930s; and the Wellington Evening Post in the 1980s. Its purpose is to show how children reflected their world, interacted with editors, and interpreted the adult world in published writing, and to examine continuities and changes between the 1930s and 1980s. It seeks evidence of gender variations in writing. and explores the circumstances in which the social role of writing was established by young writers. It considers the ways in which children (especially girls) consciously and unconsciously used public writing to create a public place for themselves. It compares major themes chosen by children, their topic and genre preferences in writing, and the gender and age differences evident in these preferences. The thesis is organised into three Parts, with an Introduction discussing the scholarly background to the issues it explores, and its methodology. Part One contains two chapters examining the format and tone of each Children's Page. And the role and influence of their Editors. Part Two (also of two chapters) investigates the origins and motivations of the young contributors, with a special focus on the Otago Daily Times as a community newspaper. Part Three. of four chapters, explores the children's writing itself, in separate chapters on younger and older children, and a chapter on the most popular genre, poetry. The conclusion suggests further areas of research, and points to the implications of the findings of the thesis for social history in New Zealand and for classroom practice. The thesis contains a Bibliography and an Appendix with a selection of writings by Janet Frame and her family to the Otago Daily Times Children's Page in the 1930s.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420200 Literature Studies::420201 New Zealand literature in English</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tamarillo mosaic potyvirus: characterization and resistance</field><field name="creator">MacDiarmid, Robin M.</field><field name="description">The export of tamarillo is an important component of the New Zealand, exotic fruit industry. However, the quality of tamarillo fruit is severely decreased by tamarillo mosaic potyvirus (TaMV) which detrimentally affects fruit colour resulting in the fruit being unacceptable on the international marketplace. Virus incidence was surveyed in four tamarillo growing regions. Viruses were detected by indicator plant symptomology, and the incidence confirmed by dot blot analysis or ELISA. TaMV was present in 100% of tamarillo trees analyzed in ten of the twelve orchards surveyed. Incidence of potato aucuba mosaic potexvirus, cucumber mosaic cucumovirus, alfalfa mosaic virus and arabis mosaic nepovirus, which had all been previously reported in tamarillo was also determined. Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus was identified for the first time in tamarillo plants in New Zealand. TaMV RNA was purified from infected tamarillo leaves and a 1600 base pair cDNA clone generated to the 3'-terminus. The clone was sequenced and the location of the gene for the coat protein was identified by direct amino-terminal sequencing of purified TaMV coat protein. Comparison with other potyvirus coat protein sequences established that TaMV represents a new member of the potyvirus group. Seven chimeric transgenes containing TaMV sequences were constructed in three different binary vectors suitable for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of plants. Of the twenty-six independent Nicotiana benthamiana plant lines generated expressing either TaMV coat protein or TaMV RNA sequences modified to block translation, eight plant lines demonstrated resistance to virus infection (more than 10% of resistant plants/line). All plants of one line, PT#25, were resistant to TaMV infection using dilute inocula; 40% were also resistant after inoculation with more concentrated inocula. The level of accumulation of CP in transgenic plant lines did not correspond with the degree of resistance to TaMV infection. In eight of the twenty-six transgenic lines a proportion of plants demonstrated recovery from systemic infection. Recovery was manifested as an absence or significant reduction of virus symptoms in newly developed leaves of plants that had previously shown symptoms of systemic TaMV infection. The mechanism of recovery from systemic infection is discussed. The protocol for the regeneration of transgenic tamarillo by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation was improved. The efficiency of transformation was optimized and the rate of transgenic shoot elongation was increased. Two tamarillo plants transformed with a transgene designed to express the TaMV coat protein were produced and were demonstrated to express the neomycin phosphotransferase gene and TaMV coat protein gene. However, following challenge with a low concentration of inoculum, micropropagants of these tamarillo plants failed to demonstrate resistance to TaMV infection. Three in vitro enzymatic activities of the virus encoded cytoplasmic inclusion protein were studied. The cytoplasmic inclusion protein was purified to near homogeneity using differential centrifugation and sucrose gradient purification. RNA-stimulated ATPase activity was demonstrated and the Km and Vmax determined. RNA binding and energy-dependent dissociation were characterized. RNA helicase activity of the cytoplasmic inclusion protein was demonstrated in the presence of NTP using RNA duplexes with single-stranded overhangs. These results have confirmed and extended the previous findings of the likely RNA helicase function of the potyvirus cytoplasmic inclusion protein, and suggest possible future mechanisms for obtaining resistance to potyviruses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Plant Science)--University of Auckland, 1994.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2320</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Host races and cryptic species in marine symbionts</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Peter M. (Peter Michael)</field><field name="description">The Pinnotheridae is a family of decapod crustaceans comprising more than 120 mostly microphagous and commensal species. As symbionts of a variety of aquatic invertebrates, pinnotherids typically live in an intimate association with their host depending on it for an almost lifelong source of nourishment and shelter, together with a site for mating. The New Zealand pinnotherid fauna was thought to comprise only one species, Pinnotheres novaezelandiae Filhol, associated with a multitude of hosts. Recently, however, a separate species, P. atrinicola Page, has been described which is regarded as being host specific to the horse mussel Atrina zelandica Gray. In this context, the relationship between pea crabs and their hosts is of special interest, and is the focus of this thesis. An investigation into the population dynamics of the symbiotic relationship between P novaezelandiae and its host, the green-lip mussel Perna canaliculus, at Westmere Reef, Auckland between May 1986 and July 1988 is reported. Ovigerous females and Stage I males and females were found throughout the sampling period, indicating that reproduction is continuous in this species. The developmental composition of the pea crab population reveals that soft-shelled males, usually regarded as an anomalous instar, formed a significant component of the pea crab population at all times. It is suggested that these individuals represent a distinct facies, analogous to the Stage II female instar. The presence of a pea crab was found to have a highly significant detrimental effect on mussel condition. Analysis of the distribution of pea crabs among the mussel population indicates mature crabs display a repulsed distribution favouring to live a solitary existence, whereas younger (pre-hard and Stage I) crabs showed a random distribution in broad agreement with a theoretical Poisson distribution. The biological status of the two described taxa was investigated by a survey of electrophoretically detectable genetic variation of populations from throughout the North Island of New Zealand. Pea crabs from 18 host populations from nine geographically disparate localities were subjected to cellulose acetate and poly-acrylamide electrophoresis. Forty-one enzyme systems were screened for polymorphism. Clearly resolved enzyme phenotypes were obtained at 23 presumptive loci, of which l5 exhibited polymorphism. An analysis of electromorph frequency data revealed that both taxa are highly genetically structured and typified by high levels of polymorphism and heterozygosity; results atypical of brachyuran crabs. P- atrinicola was found to exhibit strong patterns of geographic differentiation and clinal variation in electromorph frequency. Of particular significance is the pattern of genetic differentiation observed among populations of p. novaezelandiae. Hierarchical F-statistics indicated that the preponderance of inter-population differentiation can be attributed to differences in electromorph frequency among host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae within a sampling locality. Geographic differentiation was a comparatively insignificant factor in the structuring of the sampled P. novaezelandiae populations. Individuals belonging to two genetically very distinct units were found within a newly recorded host species, Mactra ovata ovata Gray at Green and Wood Bays, Manukau Harbour. Hardy-Weinberg analyses indicate the host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae exhibit such a pronounced pattern of homozygote excess and disturbance from genetic equilibrium in sympatry that it is unreasonable to consider them as a single panmictic population. It is concluded that significant biological discontinuities based on host origin exist within the currently recognised taxon. Such a conclusion is supported by data presented on qualitative differences in host recognition observed between different host-associated populations of P. novaezelandiae. Conservatively these discontinuities indicate host race development, although a viable alternate hypothesis would be the presence of cryptic, host-specific biological species within P. novaezelandiae. Hostrace development as found here is a well recognised phenomenon in insect-host and parasitoid-host relationships, although little studied in marine symbiotic relationships. Such a phenomenon has important implications for ecological, behavioural and physiological studies on marine symbionts in general.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of photoadaptation in the intertidal red alga Gracilaria chilensis</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Michelle Lisa Glogau</field><field name="description">The intertidal red alga, Gracilaria chilensis Bird, McLachlan et Oliveira (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales), lives in an environment in which light is highly variable in terms of both amplitude and duration. A laboratory investigation of the photophysiology of G. chilensis was conducted to assess the response of the photosynthetic apparatus to light variability characteristic of the natural environment. Freshly collected Gracilaria chilensis was found to exhibit an endogenous rhythm of photosynthesis in conditions of constant limiting light and temperature. However, such a phenomenon was not observed in saturating light. Rhythms of phycobiliprotein concentration and dark respiration were also observed but were not as well-defined and could nor account for the photosynthetic rhythm. The photosynthetic response of G. chilensis to light fluctuations of various durations (0.25 to 900 seconds) and light levels was compared to that in static light. G. chilensis was able to utilise rapidly fluctuating light (&lt; 1 second) more efficiently than fluctuations of longer duration (60-900 second). Mean photosynthetic rates were enhanced by up to l50% in fluctuating light of less than 60 sec duration over that predicted from steady-state. The photosynthetic apparatus of freshly collected G. chilensis was found to have many low-light "shade" acclimation characteristics. These included a low compensation point (5 &#181;molm-2 s-l) and onset of saturation (80 &#181;molm-2 s-l) suggesting sensitivity to photoinhibition. However, (laboratory) low-light acclimated G. chilensis was able to tolerate periods of constant high light (2000 &#181;molm-2 s-l)for periods of six hours without detectable detrimental effect on photosynthetic capacity, although photosynthetic efficiency was significantly inhibited after two hours of this treatment. The time course and characteristics of photoacclimation were determined by culturing G. chilensis in low- (15 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) and high- (180 &#181;mol m-2 s-l) light and high- and low-nitrogen regimes. The observed change in photosynthetic characteristics and pigment concentration indicated that acclimation began after a time lag of l-2 days, was complete after approximately a week and was reversible. Acclimation to growth light included changes in growth rate, P-I response curves, pigment concentration and composition and other biochemical components (e.g. carbon/nitrogen ratio). The nitrogen regime significantly affected pigment concentration in the high-light grown plants and the response suggests pigments play a role in nitrogen storage as well as light harvesting. These various physiological characteristics described above were interpreted as important mechanisms that enable G. chilensis to optimise photosynthetic response in the highly dynamic and stressful zone of the intertidal environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2322</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Symmetric Forced Oscillators</field><field name="creator">Ben-Tal, Alona</field><field name="description">In this thesis we study a class of symmetric forced oscillators modeled by non-linear ordinary differential equations. Solutions for this class of systems can be symmetric or non-symmetric. When a symmetric periodic solution loses its stability as a physical parameter is varied, and two non-symmetric periodic solutions appear, this is called a symmetry breaking bifurcation. In a symmetry increasing bifurcation two conjugate chaotic attractors (i.e.,attractors which are related to each other by the symmetry) collide and form a larger symmetric chaotic attractor. Symmetry can also be restored via explosions where, as a physical parameter is varied, two conjugate attractors (chaotic or periodic) which do not intersect are suddenly embedded in one symmetric attractor. In this thesis we show that all these apparently distinct bifurcations can be realized by a single mechanism in which two conjugate attractors collide with a symmetric limit set. The same mechanism seems to operate for at least some bifurcations involving non-attracting limit sets. We illustrate this point with examples of symmetry restoration in attracting and non-attracting sets found in the forced Duffing oscillator and in a power system. Symmetry restoration in the power system is associated with a phenomenon known as ferroresonance. The study of the ferroresonance phenomenon motivated this thesis. Part of this thesis is devoted to studying one aspect of the ferroresonance phenomenon the appearance of a strange attractor with a band-like structure. This attractor was called previously a 'pseudo-periodic' attractor. Some methods for analyzing the non-autonomous systems under study are shown. We construct three different maps which highlight different features of symmetry restoring bifurcations. One map in particular captures the symmetry of a solution by sampling it every half the period of the forcing. We describe a numerical method to construct a bifurcation diagram of periodic solutions and present a non-standard approach for converting the forced oscillator to an autonomous system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Variables affecting choice behaviour: choice behaviour and deprivation</field><field name="creator">Temple, William</field><field name="description">Pigeons were studied in concurrent chain schedules in which the terminal links were variable-interval (aperiodic) and fixed-interval (periodic) schedules.

An understanding of their wider context is essential to an understanding of the sites themselves, so a study is made of European artillery and fortification practice and technology from the 14th century onwards, with an emphasis on the coastal artillery practices of the British Empire in the 19th century. On this foundation, coastal fortification practices in New Zealand in the 19th century are examined, and the political background to the construction of coastal forts is outlined. The social and economic impact of the defences are studied, and the resources used in their construction detailed. Land acquisitions for the defence works in Auckland are examined. With a thorough understanding of their background and context (both national and international), Forts Resolution, Bastion, Takapuna, Victoria, Cautley and the submarine mining depots are then studied in detail, with limited excavations, extensive field survey, and the use of comprehensive archival sources. Fina1ly, it, is concluded that the forts built in Auckland between 1885 and 1925 were a product of the colonial experience, in that, they were a complex technological product of imperial demands and needs, and had little relevance to the realities and requirements of a small and remote colony 20,000 km away from the imperial centre. The thesis is a study of the &#8216;disappearing gun&#8217; period of coastal fortification, and also an acknowledgement that much of the evidence of this once socially and economically significant activity has been destroyed. To assist the reader, there is a large bibliography, and appendices containing a comprehensive glossary, a list of New zealand defence schemes from 1840 to 1914, a list of site record numbere, and biographical details of the key fort builders.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Governing bodies: a Maori healing tradition in a bicultural state</field><field name="creator">O'Connor, Tony, 1972-</field><field name="description">Biculturalism is a relationship in government between the British Crown and the indigenous [M&#257;ori] people of New Zealand. I show that this relationship permeated some M&#257;ori healing practitioners&#8217; healing knowledge and perception. A key way in which this occurred was through the practitioners recognizing biological and social boundaries between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; [New Zealanders of European descent]. A second was through the practitioners&#8217; embodiment of connections with social groups including the nation, a history and present shared between M&#257;ori and P&#257;keh&#257; and an idealized pre-contact past. A fundamental principle of Te Oo Mai Reia was that for the practitioners to harness the power of the various forces that sustained life they had to be in touch with their whakapapa [genealogy] for it was through their ancestors that they could commune with the Ultimate Deity, Io, the source of the most potent of all forces of life. A further key principle was that spiritually inspired and traditional M&#257;ori culture heightened the wellbeing of M&#257;ori, not modern, P&#257;keh&#257; culture. Spiritual and ancient knowledge was supra-conscious and made knowable through an embodied awareness of self and other. To make my argument I draw on literature inspired by Foucault that shows how states govern by implementing their operations and securing their penetration into the citizenry by drawing and building upon pre-existing bodies of knowledge and relations of power. I also draw on literature that shows how the human body bears the effects of such practices of government. To this literature I integrate perception by showing how, in this M&#257;ori healing context, the government of the bicultural nation-state worked through the ways the practitioners made sense with the body (especially through feeling, seeing and touching).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">healing</field><field name="subject">body</field><field name="subject">medical anthropology</field><field name="subject">governmentality</field><field name="subject">embodiment</field><field name="subject">perception</field><field name="subject">biculturalism</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase characterisation and kinetic studies</field><field name="creator">Cleverly, Douglas Robert</field><field name="description">Chapter One begins with an introduction to enzymology and leads into a discussion on BSSL beginning with the physical properties and the source of the enzyme. The literature concerning the kinetic properties of BSSL is reviewed, followed by a discussion on how the structure of enzymes influences their catalytic activity and specificity. The use of X-ray crystallographic techniques is addressed as a means of elucidating the three dimensional structure of enzymes. The chemicals, apparatus and standard methodologies used in this present investigation are described in Chapter Two. The means by which kinetic data measured for an enzyme-substrate system are analysed and compared are also discussed. Chapter Three describes the purification of bile salt-stimulated human milk lipase (BSSL) from whole human milk. A detailed study of the activity of the purified protein has been conducted against both lipid and ester substrates in order to monitor the progress of the purification. A further determination of the physical properties of the protein has also been conducted. Results from these studies have identified the protein as BSSL. In Chapter Four the methods used for determining the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme are described. This study has revealed interesting homologies with enzymes from other species. The sequence of that part of the enzyme which includes the active site has been determined and has been found to be identical to the consensus sequence found in the active site of pancreatic lipase, serine proteases and cholinesterases. It may therefore be postulated that the similarity observed for some of the kinetic behaviour of enzymes arises from homology in their amino acid sequences and, in particular, those portions of the protein comprising the active site. The use of kinetic isotope effects, to gain insight as to the mechanism of BSSL catalysed hydrolysis of lipid substrates, is the subject of Chapter Five. A mechanism has been proposed which explains the observed effects and takes into account information from the literature. The mechanism also incorporates findings made from the amino acid sequence study and the literature reports on the residues involved in catalysis. Chapter Six begins within a literature survey of detergent less microemulsions and continues with an account of the kinetic properties of BSSL in this new and novel medium in which enzymic reactions involving substrates of low water solubility may be conducted. The advantage of this medium is that it allows one to monitor the reaction by spectrophotometric means. In more traditional methods of assay of lipid substrates this is not normally possible. This advantage has also been exploited in the study of the kinetics of BSSL against triolein in reversed micelles, which is the subject of Chapter Seven. A detailed description is given of an FT-IR technique which allows one to monitor the course of reaction of biologically important substrates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2329</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Geology of the Coromandel region with emphasis on some economic aspects</field><field name="creator">Skinner, D. N. B. (David N. B.)</field><field name="description">An account is given of the early geological exploration and mining history of the Coromandel Goldfield. The writer's interpretation of the basement and igneous geology, and of the metallogenesis of gold-silver and base metal ores has resulted in radical changes. The original threefold sub-division of the Jurassic sedimentary basement rocks (Manaia Hill Group) has been condensed to two formations (Tokatea Hill and Manaia Hill) on the basis of their detrital content and structure; standard sections are described. The older (Manaia Hill Formation) is characterised by lithic volcanic greywacke- and subgreywacke-type sedimentary rocks, that were derived from a landmass comprising an assemblage of calc-alkaline volcanic and plutonic rocks, with minor sedimentary rocks. The deposit was formed by turbidity currents on a continental slope bordering a geosyncline. Secondary minerals diagnostic of low grade metamorphism of the Zeolite and Prehnite-Pumpellyite Facies occur locally in the Manaia Hill Formation. These not only include normal prehnite, laumontite-leonhardite, analcime, and actinolite, but also prehnite with anomalously low refractive indices. In contrast, the rocks of the younger formation (Tokatea Hill) are feldspathic greywackes almost devoid of volcanic detritus except near the formation boundary with Manaia Hill Formation. They have a sericiterich, authigenic matrix, but no zeolites or prehnite. The sediments were derived from a landmass of low relief composed of granodiorite-diorite plutonic rocks and minor sedimentary rocks. The lower parts of the formation are slope turbidites while the upper parts are the product of stable deposition in deeper water. The structure of the Manaia Hill Group is relatively simple over most of the Coromandel area. The beds have a north-west to north-north-west strike and are folded about axes with a similar trend; joint directions corroborate this conclusion. A north-east trend has been imposed on the rocks of the Moehau region by the intrusion of Paritu Quartz-diorite. Conformity between the two formations is shown by gradational detrital content and by structural continuity. In older descriptions, the volcanic rocks of Coromandel were subdivided into an older, gold-bearing, and a younger, barren series of andesites with minor dacites and rhyolites. By ignoring post-eruptional properties (i.e. hydrothermal alteration) a different view of the volcanic stratigraphy is demonstrated. The extrusive rocks are now subdivided into nine formations with no major regional break but with disconformity or unconformity between them caused by local quiescence. With the addition of two intrusive formations with volcanic affinities (Castle Rock Dacite and Kai-iti Porphyrites) all the volcanic rocks are included together as the Coromandel Group of Miocene age. The new effusive formations from oldest youngest are: Port Charles Andesite; Omoho Formation (rhyolitic); Kokumata Dacite; Te Karaka Andesite; Cousin Jack Andesite; Parakete Formation (dacite-andesite); Rauporoa Basaltic-andesite; Tuateawa Andesite; and Beesons Island Volcanics (andesite-dacite). The last formation has been considerably redefined since it is the sole surviving name from earlier published descriptions of the volcanic geology. Two zeolites (phillipsite and levyne) are described. Hydrothermal alteration and mineralisation cut across formation boundaries and are controlled by fault and shear zones. The writer, unlike earlier workers, recognises faults as important in the development of the geology. The fracture pattern in the basement rocks not only controls the regional fault pattern but also the fracture pattern in the volcanic rocks immediately overlying the basement. Stress patterns have been synthesised from structural analyses of faults, shears, veins, and gold-bearing lodes, which suggest that since the Mesozoic, a major compressional stress has been directed approximately north-east/south-west. A local secondary stress (north-north-west/south-south/east) is indicated during the mid-Tertiary. Major late Tertiary normal fault movement is explained by postulating horizontal tension relief by gravity following differential vertical movement along pre-existing faults, as a result of doming induced by intrusion and eruption of magma. A regional gravity survey has been tied to the known geology and structure. Models of possible mass distribution are computed for individual Bouguer anomalies. Major geological features are confirmed but stations are too spread to relate mineralisation with the gravity pattern. The results of a stream sediment reconnaissance geochemical survey of cold extractable and total copper, lead, and arsenic, are appraised in relation to known geological structural and historical features. The effects of pH, flocculants, and contamination are considered and the analytical methods reviewed. The standards of anomalous concentration levels are statistically calculated, and related to different possible sources of metal within a given terrain. Recommendations for further exploration and analytical work are made for those areas where possible economic mineralisation has been detected. In particular, the Moehau region near Paritu Quartz-diorite shows strong signs of copper enrichment. No examples of ore from any of the old mines were available; the study of the sulphide mineralisation has been confined to outcrops of veins, and samples from tip-heads. Although many of the samples show indefinite mineral relationships, the similarity of paragenetic sequence for all areas suggests that the deductions for the whole field are valid. Several minerals have not been previously recorded from Coromandel, notably wolframite, molybdenite, pyrrhotite and tetrahedrite. The structural control of mineralisation by the fracture pattern is emphasised, and also the absence of any direct genetic relationship to the volcanic rocks of the Coromandel Group. Instead, there is a zonal genetic relationship of the ore minerals of the Moehau region about Paritu Quartz-diorite. The similarity of the paragenetic sequence of other deposits to that of the Moehau region suggests similar sources, i.e. hydrothermal exhalations from consolidating subjacent granodiorite-type plutons. Whilst future economic prospects for Coromandel itself my depend on deeper workings approaching such bodies, the Paritu Quartz-diorite pluton could contain a more accessible porphyry copper deposit, with associated tungsten and molybdenum minerals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1967.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Science/Fiction of Sex. A Feminist Deconstruction of the Vocabularies of Heterosex</field><field name="creator">Potts, Annie</field><field name="description">This research conducts a feminist poststructuralist examination of the vocabularies of heterosex: it investigates those terms, modes of talking, and meanings relating to sex which are associated with discourses such as scientific and popular sexology, medicine and psychiatry, public health, philosophy, and some feminist critique. The analysis of these various representations of heterosex involves the deconstruction of binaries such as presence/absence, mind/body, inside/outside and masculine/feminine, that are endemic to Western notions of sex. It is argued that such dualisms (re)produce and perpetuate differential power relations between men and women, and jeopardize the negotiation of mutually pleasurable and safer heterosex. Particular attention is paid to the ways in which sexological discourse deploys such dualisms as normal/abnormal, natural/unnatural, and healthy/unhealthy sex, and produces specifically gendered 'experiences' of sexual corporeality. The thesis examines a variety of written texts and excerpts from film and television; it also analyzes transcript material from individual and group interviews conducted by the researcher with heterosexual women and men, as well as sexual health and mental health professionals, in order to identify cultural pressures influencing participation in risky heterosexual behaviours, and also to identify alternative and safer pleasurable practices. Some of these alternative practices are suggested to rely on a radical reformulation of sexual relations which derives from the disruption of particular dualistic ways of understanding and enacting sex. The overall objective of the thesis is to deconstruct cultural imperatives of heterosex and promote the generation and acceptance of other modes of erotic pleasure. It is hoped that this research will be of use in the future planning and implementation of sex education and safer sex campaigns in Aotearoa/New Zealand which aim to be non-phallocentric and non-heterosexist, and which might recognize a feminist poststructuralist politics of sexual difference.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2331</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ethnomathematics: Exploring Cultural Diversity in Mathematics</field><field name="creator">Barton, Bill, 1948-</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a new conceptualisation of ethnomathematics which avoids some of the difficulties which emerge in the literature. In particular, work has been started on a philosophic basis for the field. There is no consistent view of ethnomathematics in the literature. The relationship with mathematics itself has been ignored, and the philosophical and theoretical background is missing. The literature also reveals the ethnocentricity implied by ethnomathematics as a field of study based in a culture which has mathematics as a knowledge category. Two strategies to over come this problem are identified: universalising the referent of &#8216;mathematics&#8217; so that it is the same as &#8220;knowledge-making&#8221;; or using methodological techniques to minimise it. The position of ethnomathematics in relationship to anthropology, sociology, history, and politics is characterised on a matrix. A place for ethnomathematics is found close the anthropology of mathematics, but the aim of anthropology is to better understand culture in general, while ethnomathematics aims to better understand mathematics. Anthropology, however, contributes its well-established methodologies for overcoming ethnocentricity. The search for a philosophical base finds a Wittgensteinian orientation which enables culturally based &#8216;systems of meaning&#8217; to gain credibility in mathematics. A definition is proposed for ethnomathematics as the study of mathematical practices within context. Four types of ethnomathematical activity are identified: descriptive, archaeological, mathematising, and analytical activity. The definition also gives rise to a categorisation of ethnomathematical work along three dimensions: the closeness to conventional mathematics; the historical time; and the type of host culture. The mechanisms of interaction between mathematical practices are identified, and the imperialistic growth of mathematics is explained. Particular features of ethnomathematical theory are brought out in a four examples. By admitting the legitimacy of other viewpoints, ethnomathematics opens mathematics to new creative forces. Within education, ethnomathematics provides new choices, and turns cultural conflict into a useful tool for teaching. Mathematical activity exists in a variety of contexts. Learning mathematics involves being aware of, and integrating, diverse concepts. Ethnomathematics expands mathematical horizons, so that cultural diversity becomes a richer contributor to the cultural structures which humans use to understand their world.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences::230100 Mathematics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics Education)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2332</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Acid mucopolysaccharides in the Demospongiae: their significance in taxonomy, aggregation and adhesion</field><field name="creator">Evans, Clive W.</field><field name="description">The acid-mucopolysaccharides (AMPs) found within the Demospongiae have been identified by electrophoresis, and their localization within adult tissues, aggregates and metamorphosing larvae have been examined by histological and ultrastructural techniques. Electrophoresis of the AMPs extracted from a selection of Demospongiae showed that most of the AMPs typical of vertebrate connective tissues were present. No evidence was found in this study to suggest a possible role whereby the presence or absence of sulphated AMPs could be of use in sponge taxonomy. Histochemical studies on the cytological localization of AMPs in both adult tissues and developing larvae also failed to provide any evidence to support the previous hypothesis that AMP localization could be used as an aid in the classification of the Demospongiae. Ultrastructural studies on the localization of AMPs indicated several mechanisms whereby AMPs could contribute to sponge cohesion. The AMPs associated with collagen fibrils were found to be arranged in a way essentially similar to that already described for mammals, and various other lines of evidence confirm the similarity of the sponge mesohyl to vertebrate connective tissue. There is, however, no need to imply a direct evolutionary relationship. The possible role of AMPs in both cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion has been examined in detail. Evidence is presented for the existence of an aggregation factor in Microciona coccinea. The factor has been shown to be a proteoglycan in a closely related species of sponge, and although conclusive evidence on the role of factor is lacking it is interpreted by many workers to be a surface attached molecule involved in adhesion. No evidence was obtained in this study to confirm localization of the factor at the sponge cell surface, but this may be a result of limitations in present ultrastructural techniques. Initial cell contact in cell-cell adhesion during aggregation was seen to occur in the regions of narrow extensions of the plasmalemmae termed membrane bridges. Structures of this sort have been proposed on physical grounds as one means by which cells may overcome the electric repulsive barrier between them to make adhesion by ionic bridging. Adhesion to the substrate in metamorphosing sponge larvae was seen to be mediated by a groundmat which is believed to be secreted by the larva, and which contains a granular component as well as collagen and fine filaments. The role of junctions in cell-cell adhesion was examined in detail in adult sponges and in aggregated cells. The presence of the cell junctions characteristic of other organisms could not be convincingly demonstrated in sponge tissues, and it seems probable that structures other than the typical cell junctions may be involved in communication and adhesion within sponges. An unusual AMP surface coat &#8211; the larval coat &#8211; is described from the surface of the T-pinacocytes in metamorphosing larvae of Halichondria moorei. The similarity of this coat in some respects to the fuzzy surface coat of amoebae is noted, and some of its possible functions are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1975.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glucose Transporters in Diabetic Complications of the Lens</field><field name="creator">Merriman-Smith, B. Rachelle</field><field name="description">Lens transparency is primarily maintained by the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. Glucose is transported from the aqueous humuor to the lens epithelial cells however, it has not yet been established how glucose penetrates to the inner part of the lens. The core of the lens is acidic, approximately pH 6.5, as an effect of the accumulation of lactate, the end-product of glycolysis. This confirms that glucose is drawn deep into the core of the lens. Until recently it was assumed that glucose was transported to the core via a gap junction-mediated route by cell-cell diffusion. However, passive diffusion is limited in capacity and is unlikely to be sufficient for nutrient transport especially for larger lenses. Instead, an active circulation system has been proposed that has the potential to transport glucose deep into the lens via an extracellular route. This would imply that fibre cells may have evolved their own glucose uptake system, yet no direct evidence to this effect has been available. My thesis describes new molecular evidence that both epithelial and fibre cells have evolved their own glucose uptake system. The rat lens expresses the facilitative glucose transporters GLUTI and GLUT3 differentially. GLUTI is predominantly expressed in the epithelium while GLUT3 is predominantly expressed in the fibre cells of the lens. In the normal lens, this makes good physiological sense. GLUTI has a high Km suitable for situations of high glucose concentrations, as is the case for the epithelium where the aqueous humour mirrors glucose concentrations found in blood. GLUT3 has a lower Km and is particularly suitable for the fibre cells, where the supply of glucose from the tortuous extracellular space is limited. The discovery of GLUT3 in the fibre cells lends strong support for the existence of an active circulation system in the lens and makes it seem unlikely that glucose is transported into the core via gap junction-mediated diffusion. In the diabetic state, sorbitol - a product of glucose metabolism, occurs at elevated levels of about 30 times more than that of the normal, suggesting a significant increase in glucose uptake. This imposes an osmotic stress on the lens, which can be countered by regulated cell volume decrease only in the outer but not in the inner cortex. As a consequence inner cortex tissue breaks down and opacities result. My studies of the diabetic rat lens shows that the situation is made worse by an apparent up-regulation of GLUT3 in the fibre cells. Quantitative RT-PCR shows that the GLUT3 transcript is up-regulated six-fold during the initial weeks of diabetic insult in the streptozotocin rat model. The up-regulated GLUT3 protein is detected in the region where maximum tissue damage occurs. These results suggest a new mechanism for the initial tissue damage in the diabetic lens, whereby increased uptake of glucose leads to an over-production of sorbitol which causes osmotic stress on the fibre cells that is beyond their defense capability of regulated cell volume decrease. While my results described above have revolutionized our view of nutrient transport in the lens and its potential role in the early stages of diabetic cataract, the picture is only complete when the functionality of GLUT3 can be demonstrated. For this purpose, vesicles were prepared from isolated lens fibre cells and subjected to quantitative uptake studies using a fluorescent glucose derivative. Uptake was greatly reduced using the GLUT-specific inhibitor phloretin demonstrating that GLUT3 of the rat lens fibre cells is indeed fully functional. In summary, my results add a new dimension to our understanding of how the lens maintains homeostasis and tissue transparency. The lens has evolved an ingenious system to supply, nutrients to the core region to compensate for the absence of a vasculature. However, by achieving this, it has rendered itself unable to defend itself against the adverse effects of high glucose. My results also contribute towards developing new strategies of rational drug design to prevent or delay cataract.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tastant interactions with model membranes</field><field name="creator">Shaw, Patricia</field><field name="description">A wide range of compounds elicit the sweet taste response but currently it is not known what causes this response. In Chapter 3 a number of sweeteners, and representatives of all the taste groups are investigated using NMR spectroscopy. The T1 relaxation times of the tastants were determined in aqueous solution and in solution with liposomes, a model membrane system. The observed changes in T1, values are analysed to determine which regions of the tastants are involved in the interaction with the membrane. In Chapters 4 and 5 an investigation is reported of the interaction of tastants with a liquid membrane system, which is reportedly able to distinguish between classes of chemicals. The interest lies in developing a simple experiment that will enable taste qualities to be predicted, something that is currently not possible. In Chapters 6 and 7 the NMR assignments of some sweeteners is discussed. NMR assignments are a necessary precursor before their sweetening properties can be studied by NMR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Professional Expertise: A Model for Integration and Change</field><field name="creator">Yielder, Jill</field><field name="description">The nature of professional expertise has been widely debated in the literature. However it has been examined primarily from a dichotomy of perspectives - either from an experiential or a cognitive focus, without the attempt to integrate these, and other aspects of expertise, into an integrated and coherent model. This research is structured in two sections. The first part incorporates a philosophical discussion, which advances an integrated model of professional expertise. The second part uses a case study focused on the field of medical imaging to illustrate and refine the model. Ten professionals identified as experts in the various sub-specialties within medical imaging were guided through a sustained period of interviews and logging of critical incidents in order to elicit in-depth data in relation to the process of expertise. Findings showed that while expertise is situated in the context of practice, it incorporates several dimensions working together in an integrated, seamless fashion through the medium of the individual practitioner. The proposed model integrates five main aspects, namely: knowledge base; cognitive processes; internal integrative processes; interpersonal relationships; and professional practice. That is, it is a synthesis of a particular knowledge base, the cognitive processes, personality and internal processes of the practitioner. It manifests through, and builds on, interpersonal relationships with clients and other professionals, and is expressed through the actual doing of professional practice. It is through the reflexive examination of practice and management of change that professionals may transform these five integrated aspects into the qualitative state of expertise. One of the implications of these findings for higher education are that institutions providing professional education need to value all the dimensions of expertise and their effective integration in order to promote the learning required to advance professionals towards this level of practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hydrolysis of amides and ureas in acid solutions</field><field name="creator">Giffney, Carolyn Janet</field><field name="description">Despite the vast amount of research reported on the acid-catalysed hydrolysis of amides, the mechanism of reaction has remained a source of controversy. The various literature results have been summarised in the introduction. Two series of amides have been studied in this investigation, one a series of N-substituted, 4-chlorobenzamides, the other a series of substituted acetanilides. Their basicity (or acid-dissociation) constants have been evaluated in sulphuric acid, and the rates of hydrolysis measured over a wide range of acid concentrations. Within each series, variation of the substituent causes the rate constant to vary in a way which is typical of a bimolecular reaction involving rate-determining nucleophilic attack of water on the protonated intermediate. By drawing a comparison between the two series of amides, (i.e. the difference in basicities and rates of hydrolysis) it becomes apparent that the 0-protonated amide, which is thermodynamically favoured, is not the kinetically active species, A new rate equation is proposed, the equation being based on a mechanism in which water attacks the carbonyl carbon in the rate-determining step. The equation confidently predicts the experimental rate-profiles for the acid-hydrolysis of simple amides. It has been applied, in two forms, to the experimental rate data; the first form allows for the involvement of three water molecules in the slow step of hydrolysis, and the second form allows for the involvement of only two water molecules. The rate equation, in these two forms, has also been applied to much of the hydrolysis data reported in the literature and again it has proved to be very successful. In contrast to the amides, ureas have not been subjected to extensive research. In this investigation, the basicity constants of a series of substituted phenylureas have been measured, (if not already available) and the hydrolysis reactions carried out over a wide range of sulphuric acid concentrations, as well as in water. The 4-methyl and 4-chloro-phenylureas have also been hydrolysed in a range of hydrochloric and perchloric acid solutions; the effects of added salt were studied and the solvent isotope effects on the rate were evaluated. All these results, together with information obtained from application of the Hammett equation to the rate data, were in agreement with a mechanism involving a pre-equilibrium protonation to form the minor, N-protonated conjugate acid. This is followed by a slow transfer of the proton attached to the alternate nitrogen atom to form the appropriately substituted phenylisocyanate, and rapid reaction of this intermediate to form products. The substituent effects on the n.m.r. spectra of the substituted acetanilides and phenylureas have also been reported.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1974.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CHESS: Chief Executive Stress Survival: a study of occupational stress in New Zealand top management</field><field name="creator">Robinson, Paul F.</field><field name="description">This study develops and used a CHESS (chief Executive Stress Survival) model developed from the occupational stress literature to predict variations in the psychological and physical stress experience and health risk of chief Executives of New Zealand organisations. The model proposes that stress is a sequential process with identifiable phases and that variation are mainly due to the frequency of environmental experiences and stressor factors which are both &#8220;chronic&#8221; and &#8220;episodic&#8221;, &#8220;at work&#8221; and &#8220;outside work&#8221;. The model also assumes, however, that the impact of the environmental variables and stressor factors are moderated by individual personality differences, coping mechanisms and stress management practices. The model was tested on a sample of 107 male chief Executive officers and General Managers. It was found that the majority of the sample (80%) were relatively stress resistant and healthy. Stepwise multiple regression was used to test the model, and some evidence derived suggests that the frequency of environmental problems does predict various stress symptoms and that environmental stressors ultimately predict health risk profiles. Individual differences are shown as being largely independent variables predicting stress, rather that being moderating variables as suggested by the model. Coping and stress management variables are also shown to play a significant moderating role in the stress - outcome relationship. Some evidence derived suggests that there may be individual manager profiles, provisionally labelled &#8220;stress immune&#8221; vs &#8220;vulnerable&#8221; and &#8220;ill - health preventers&#8221; vs &#8220;non-preventers&#8221;.

The extracts were incubated with radiolabelled tryptophan and other substrates and cofactors thought to be involved in indoleacetic acid biosynthesis. After incubation indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid were separated and quantified by HPLC. There was no significant difference in the conversion of tryptophan to indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid between the incubations and control incubations using boiled extract. The concentrations of indolepyruvate and indoleacetic acid in mung bean hypocotyl suspension cultures were measured using GC-MS SIM over the growth of the culture, a period of 29 days. Indoleacetic acid concentrations, although scattered, mostly remained at constant low levels in the range of 6 to 9ng/g fwt of culture. The indolepyruvate levels steadily increased to a maximum level after 14 days, then remained at this level, 10 to 12 ng/g fwt, for the remainder of the culture period. This plateau in indolepyruvate concentration matched the period that the suspension culture was in the logarithmic phase of growth. An aromatic amino acid aminotransferase was purified over 33,000 fold from the shoots and primary leaves of mung beans, as determined using a tryptophan aminotransferase activity assay. The enzyme was a monomer, with a molecular weight of about 58kDa. The pH optimum was broad, with a maximum at about 8.6. The relative activities of the aromatic amino acids were: tryptophan 100, tyrosine 83 and phenylalanine 75, and the Kms were 0.095, 0.08 and 0.07mM respectively. The enzyme was able to use 2-oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate and pyruvate as the oxo acid substrate at relative activities 100, 128 and 116 and Kms 0.65, 0.25 and 0.24mM respectively In addition to the aromatic amino acids the enzyme was able to transaminate alanine, arginine, leucine and lysine to a lesser extent, and showed slight activity with asparagine, aspartate, histidine, valine and D-tryptophan and tyrosine. Inhibition studies showed that the alanine, aspartate and histidine activities were part of the aromatic amino acid aminotransferase activity. The enzyme was not inhibited by indoleacetic acid, although naphthaleneacetic acid did inhibit slightly. There was evidence of substrate inhibition by hydroxyphenylpyruvate at high concentrations. Addition of the cofactor pyridoxal phosphate only slightly increased the activity of the enzyme. The enzyme was blotted onto a PVDF membrane cleaved by in situ trypsin digest. Three of the tryptic fragments were sequenced. These fragments had approximately 60% sequence similarity with plant aspartate aminotransferases and tyrosine aminotransferases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Worlds in Collision: The Gay Debate in New Zealand 1960-86</field><field name="creator">Guy, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the public debate on homosexuality in New Zealand in the period 1960-86. Its focus is primarily on male homosexuality because the central issue was the continued criminalization of male same-sex sexual acts. The thesis notes irresolvable problems of definition of homosexuality involving discussions of behaviour, orientation and identity. Nevertheless, the debate proceeded on a binary basis, that homosexuals and heterosexuals were two clearly defined groups of people. The thesis begins by noting the repression and invisibility of homosexuals in the 1960s. It then explores the origins and significance of the New Zealand Homosexual Law Reform Society and the gay liberation movement. Because of the significance of religion in regard to the debate, a chapter is devoted to major change and cleavage that occurred within the churches relating to homosexuality in the period reviewed. Finally the intense fifteen months of debate that occurred prior to decriminalization of male homosexual activity in July 1986 is studied at depth. The thesis highlights the intensity of feeling that the debate engendered. This was the result of the clash of fundamentally different worldviews and value systems. Behind the particular issue lay the question of the moral and social status of homosexuals and homosexual acts. So fundamental was this division that from both sides the very future of society seemed to be at stake. Worlds were in collision.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--History)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Citizenship Under Neo-Liberalism: Immigrant Minorities in New Zealand 1990-1999</field><field name="creator">McMillan, Katherine Alexandra</field><field name="description">Ideally, a citizen is an individual who is a formal member of a self-governing political community, with individual rights and freedoms that are equal to those of other citizens, and which are protected by law. This thesis investigates how closely the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities in New Zealand approximated this ideal during the 1990s. Its particular focus is on how the neo-liberal ideology of National and Coalition Governments between 1990 and 1999, and those Governments' understandings of the nature and political significance of ethnicity, affected the ability of those belonging to non-Maori ethnic minority groups to be full and equal members of the New Zealand political community, with an equal capacity for self-governance at the individual level and as members of the political community. The thesis takes the form of a survey of public policy and law over a period of nine years. Five broad areas or aspects of public policy are examined: the collection and dissemination of official 'ethnic' statistics; immigration and citizenship policy; civil rights provided for in domestic and international law; mechanisms for ensuring access to political decision-making; and social policy. The question asked in the thesis is whether the policies developed and administered in each of these areas during the 1990s enriched or detracted from the citizenship status of non-Maori ethnic minorities.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science::360100 Political Science</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political Studies)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and functional significance of ATP binding cassette transporters in human placenta</field><field name="creator">Evseenko, Denis</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to study ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters in the human placenta, in particular their regulation and role in trophoblast differentiation and survival. The presence and localisation of four major placental drug transporters, multidrug resistance gene product 1 and 3 (MDR1 and 3)/ABC subfamily B members 1 and 4 (ABCB1 and 4), multidrug resistance associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP1 and 2)/ABCC1 and 2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 was initially studied in term human placenta, cultured primary trophoblast and BeWo and Jar trophoblast-like cell lines. Jar cells were found to be more similar to nondifferentiated cytotrophoblast with respect to their ABC protein expression profile, whereas BeWo cells more closely reflected differentiated syncytiotrophoblast. Treatment of primary term trophoblasts in vitro with cytokines (TNF-&#61537; or IL-1&#61538;) decreased expression and activity of apical transporters ABCB1/MDR1 and ABCG2/BCRP. Growth factors, on the other hand, increased BCRP expression and activity, while estradiol stimulated BCRP, MDR1 and MDR3 expression MDR1/3 functional activity. The ability of BCRP/ABCG2 to abrogate the apoptotic effects of TNF-&#61537; and ceramides was studied in primary trophoblast and BeWo cells using pharmacological and molecular (siRNA) approaches. The results suggest that BCRP/ABCG2 contributes to the resistance of trophoblast cells to cytokine-induced (extrinsic) apoptosis, whereas its effects on apoptosis activated via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is minimal. This altered resistance was associated with increased intracellular accumulation of ceramides and reduced ability to maintain phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. A role for BCRP/ABCG2 in cell protection from differentiation-induced stressors was also demonstrated during the process of cell fusion associated with transient loss of plasma membrane lipid asymmetry. Finally, expression of BCRP/ABCG2 (and 9 other genes) was studied in 50 placentas from normal pregnancy and pregnancies complicated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). A marked reduction of BCRP/ABCG2 and MDR1/ABCB1 expression was observed in FGR placentas, while other transporter genes were unaffected. Collectively these data suggest that BCRP/ABCG2 and probably other ABC transporters may play a hitherto unrecognised survival role in the placenta, conferring a &#8220;stress resistance&#8221; to trophoblast cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Placenta</field><field name="subject">ABC transporters</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of Triton X Series Nonionic Surfactant Solutions</field><field name="creator">Qiao, Lijun</field><field name="description">This work contains some fundamental investigations on Triton X series nonionic surfactants from different aspects. Techniques, such as viscometry, densimetry, diffusion measurement, ultra-violet spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry, surface tension measurement and optical microscopy were employed to acquire the information. Some theoretical analyses were given to the results of these measurements. Triton X surfactants show different properties when they dissolve in different solvents. Aggregation can occur in some solvents, depending on the interactions between solvent and solute. The addition of a surfactant to a solvent will give rise to a solute-solvent interaction and change the solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions as well. From mass transport properties of the surfactant solutions, these interactions were studied and the contributions to them from each species of the solutions were calculated with a transition-state theory model which is usually used for small molecule systems. Under some reasonable assumptions, a new theoretical method was set up and was able to give a reasonable explanation for the experimental results. The surfactants can also associate with some dyes in both polar and apolar media. The ultra-violet spectra of the surfactant-dye solutions show that surfactant-dye complexes might be formed in the polar and apolar media where the surfactants form regular and reversed micelles respectively. The mechanism of the complexation reactions was studied with equilibrium theory and the charge-transfer nature of the association between the surfactant and dye revealed. The surface tension and. cloud point changes due to the addition of polyethylene glycol were determined to discover the interaction between the water-soluble polymer PEG and the surfactants at the air-solution interface and in the bulk solutions respectively. The mass distribution of the two materials between the two phases produced in the segregation (at the cloud point) of the solutions were determined by their ultra-violet adsorption spectra and densities. The analysis of the cloud point changes was given with the new concepts of polysoap and depletion flocculation. The results show that the size of the micelles, the length of the polymer chains, and the structures of the intra - chain micelles can change the mechanisms of polymer-surfactant interaction and influence the properties of the polymer/surfactant solutions. In a certain range of concentrations, the surfactants aqueous solutions can form liquid crystalline structures which can be observed under a cross-polarised microscope and determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The phase diagrams and their variations with additions of the third component, such as xylene, polyethylene glycol and BaCl2 2H2O have been determined. The effects of temperature and each of the additives on the ordered structures were analysed separately in the light of concepts of spontaneous mean curvature and "salting out" effect. Osmotic coefficients of the surfactant aqueous and methanol solutions were determined with a vapour pressure osmometer, and the activity coefficient of the solvent can be calculated with the osmotic coefficients. The change of the activity coefficient with increase of surfactant concentration shows the interactions of the surfactant with the solvent. In aqueous solution, the addition of surfactant frees the solvent molecules, leading to an activity coefficient larger than 1. In methanol solution, the surfactant addition reduces the fugacity of methanol molecules, resulting in an activity coefficient less than 1. Chemical shift changes of protons of the surfactant molecules in the lH NMR spectra show some information about the configuration of the chains, hydration, and phase structure of the solution system when the surfactant concentration changes over the whole concentration range. From 40% w/w the associated water molecules begin to be lost, and the association number ratio of water molecules and the ethylene oxide unit of the surfactant is 4:1. Electric conductance of electrolytes in the surfactant aqueous solutions are reduced by the addition of the surfactants. The reduction is more significant for large size cations, and the longer the EO chain of the surfactant, the larger the reducing effect on conductance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of giant Kerr nonlinearity</field><field name="creator">Rebic, Stojan</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the properties of an atomic system exhibiting a giant Kerr nonlinearity. The atomic energy level scheme involves four energy levels. A three level A subsystem in the atom exhibits the effect of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), reducing the spontaneous emission noise. The fourth level leads to an ac-Stark shift of the ground state, which in turn leads to a giant, noiseless Kerr nonlinearity. Two different environments are explored. First, a system comprising of large number of atoms in an optical cavity is analysed. Detailed aspects of noise reduction in this system are investigated. In particular, strong squeezing in the quadrature in phase with the field driving the cavity mode is found, if the effective coupling of light to the atoms is strong. However, the linewidth of the predicted squeezing is found to be very narrow. This is attributed to a very steep linear susceptibility of the atomic medium. Since the widening of the squeezing window is possible only for weaker effective coupling, in turn reducing the squeezing level, a different environment is proposed. This involves a single four level atom, strongly coupled to the cavity mode. In such a strongly coupled system, the most appropriate approach is found to be that formulated in terms of polaritons &#8211; composite excitations of the 'atom-cavity molecule'. Adopting the polariton approach, nonclassical correlations in the field leaving the cavity are investigated. Strong photon antibunching is found and the effect of photon blockade predicted and described. The photon blockade effect can also be found in a system comprised of a two level atom coupled to the cavity mode, if the external driving is tuned to one of the vacuum Rabi resonances. A comparison between the two schemes is performed, and it is found that the four level scheme exhibits much better photon blockade. The reason for this is quantum interference between secondary transitions in the dressed states picture. Destructive interference cancels the transitions that would otherwise introduce a second photon into the system, hence producing a more robust photon blockade. All of these results are valid in the regime where external driving is weak. If the external driving strength is increased, the photon statistics (as measured by the zero-delay second order correlation function) changes from strong antibunching to strong bunching, over a relatively narrow range of driving strengths. The occurrence of this change can again be attributed to quantum interference. It is shown that the interference effect prevents the excitation of the composite system by a second photon, but not excitation by a two-photon transition (following the first excitation). Therefore, the third excitation manifold is excited, which then decays back to the first manifold in a two photon cascade. This two photon cascade is the source of correlated photon pairs causing an increase in the second order correlation function. The dynamics of forward scattering of light is presented, and nonclassical behaviour of the delay dependence of correlation function ('overshoots' and 'undershoots') is discussed. For the analytical treatment of this system, a method based on the polariton approach is devised, which includes the treatment of driving and damping. It is shown that this method is ideally suited to the analysis of strongly coupled systems, where only a few photons contribute to the dynamics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences::240300 Atomic and Molecular Physics; Nuclear and Particle Physics, Plasma Physics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and applied behaviour analysis</field><field name="creator">Wardlaw, Grant Ronald</field><field name="description">It is often claimed that applied behaviour analysis is founded on basic behavioural concepts involving the direct extrapolation of data from the experimental laboratory to the analysis of human behaviour. It is claimed that such an approach gives theoretical coherence to a set of procedures, and avoids the pitfalls associated with a collection of unrelated techniques. This presumed experimental base is said to make applied behaviour analysis more rigorous, more effective, more systematic, and easier to teach and learn than other approaches to the modification of human behaviour. There is reason to believe, however, that the link between experimental and applied behaviour analysis is more one of commitment than reality. Previous authors have shown that research findings from the experimental analysis of behaviour are becoming increasingly isolated from other areas of psychology in general. The present study provides evidence that such findings are also isolated from applied behaviour analysis in particular. Experimental data are seldom cited in applied work and, when they are, it is seldom specific or current data to which references are made. It is argued that this state of affairs is attributable to the acceptance, by applied behaviour analysis, of a model of behaviour whose complexity is insufficient to cope with the complex interactive nature of human behaviour. The present work provides an outline of the current applied behaviour analytic model, and then proceeds to discuss some of the major types of data of which the model takes no significant account. An extensive examination of data from the experimental analysis of choice behaviour is given, which reveals the level of complexity to which application may be made. Suggestions as to the practical utilization of these data are made, with particular reference to the areas of self-control and commitment. A case study involving the use of a commitment procedure in the treatment of an exhibitionist and another concerning the application of experimentally-derived procedures to a self-control problem, provide clinical evidence of the usefulness of the direct incorporation of experimental data. Following these applied case studies, a number of other areas of experimental research are examined with respect to their relevance to applied behaviour analysis. Significant data from the study of multiple-schedule interactions, stimulus control, and two specific types of analyses of reinforcement phenomena are outlined and suggestions made concerning their applied potential. Further, data which could determine the limits of the applicability of experimental data, in the context of biological constraints on behaviour, are shown to be capable of further increasing the utility of applied behaviour analytic techniques. Finally, the implications of the data analyzed are discussed in terms of the future training of applied behaviour analysts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control in pigeons with forebrain lesions</field><field name="creator">Wild, John Martin</field><field name="description">Lesions were placed in several areas of the telencephalon and diencephalon of the brain of the pigeon and the effects on the acquisition of inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were observed. The experimental tasks consisted of both visual and auditory interdimensional discriminations each of which had two components: In the first the stimuli were presented successively on the one response key (the main key) according to a multiple variable-interval extinction schedule. In the second the multiple schedule still obtained but a changeover key was added which, when pecked, changed the main-key stimulus, together with its associated schedule of reinforcement, to the next in a randomly ordered series. The use of these two components allowed the separation of two aspects of inhibitory control in learning: response reduction and stimulus reduction thereby permitting the assessment of discriminative ability in the absence of the confounding factor of response reduction. Inhibitory dimensional and inhibitory stimulus control were assessed by post-discrimination generalization tests and combined-cue tests, respectively. It was found that lesions to areas considered limbic - hippocampus, septum, anterior dorsomedial thalamus - had no effect on the learning of a visual discrimination. Lesions to the dorsolateral thalamus produced a complete inability to learn this discrimination, presumably due to disruption of visual fibres en route to the telecephalon. Lesions to the Wulst produced a visual discrimination learning deficit in some birds but not in others, an inconsistency not accounted for by differences in lesion size. Wulst lesions also produced an auditory discrimination learning deficit and in this case the larger the lesion, the larger the deficit. Lesions to ectostriatum produced a deficit in the visual task and lesions to Field L, an auditory projection area, produced a deficit in the auditory task, but not in the visual task. However, in most cases the discrimination learning deficit which was produced was confined to the multiple schedule where the animal had no control over the presentation or duration of the stimuli. Once the changeover key was introduced most birds obtained the learning criterion very quickly by "switching out" of the negative stimulus. This effective changeover responding, together with unimpaired inhibitory dimensional or inhibitory stimulus control, suggested that although the initial learning deficit might be described in terms of an inability to withhold responding in the presence of stimuli previously correlated with reinforcement, this inability could not readily be explained in terms of a lesion-induced impairment in an inhibitory process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1974.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of Hordeum vulgare-H bulbosum recombinants using cytological and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Liangtao</field><field name="description">Barley (Hordeum vulgare L. subsp. vulgare) is an important crop and ranks fourth in overall production of the major cereal crops in the world. Like other cereal crops, barley suffers from a narrowing of its genetic base and susceptibility to diseases, pests and environmental stresses. H. bulbosum is a possible source of desirable genes for introgressing into barley to restore genetic diversity and improve current cultivars. Sexual hybridisation between barley and H. bulbosum is the main method for interspecific gene transfer in barley breeding but there are several barriers to overcome. Two of these are reduced recombination and the ability to identify recombinants quickly and efficiently. The aim in this thesis was to gain a better understanding of meiotic chromosomal behaviour in the two species and their hybrids and to improve the characterisation of recombinants from the hybrids. To study the events during meiosis, synaptonemal complex (SC) analysis was carried out on the two species and two H. vulgare - H. bulbosum hybrids. The results indicated that there were interspecific and intraspecific variations in SC length. Mean SC length was positively correlated with recombination frequency but not related to genome size. This suggests that the ratios of mean SC length to genome size (SC/DNA) show divergence among these Hordeum examples. An hypothesis based on the conformation of chromatin associated with axial element, which is dependent on SC/DNA ratio, was presented to explain the relationship between SC length and recombination frequency. Chromosome pairing in the two hybrids was determined by observation at pachytene and metaphase I (MI). Mean percentages of synapses were similar but there were different frequencies of MI pairing between these two hybrids, indicating that different mechanisms may regulate synapsis and MI pairing in the hybrids. To investigate meiotic recombination, genomic in situ hybridisation (GISH) was performed on the two hybrids at MI and anaphase I (AI). It was observed that intergenomic pairing and recombination events occur in distal chromosome segments. A great discrepancy between mean pairing and recombination frequencies was observed in both hybrids and several possible reasons for this discrepancy were discussed. Hybrid 102C2 with high MI pairing had a significantly higher recombination frequency than the low pairing 103K5, suggesting that high MI pairing appears to be associated with high recombination in the hybrids. An interesting finding is that the ratio of recombination to MI pairing in 103K5 (l:8.9) is twice as high compared with 102C2 (l:17). However, the mechanism for this difference in the ratio between the two hybrids remains unknown. Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and GISH were used successfully to localise the introgressions in selfed progeny from a tetraploid hybrid derived from chromosome-doubled 102C2 (102C2/colch). This procedure is fast, cheap and can efficiently detect and locate introgressions. Several disease-resistant recombinants were analysed in more details and leaf rust and powdery mildew resistance was associated with distal introgressions on chromosomes 2HS and 2HL (leaf rust) and 2HS (powdery mildew). It is possible that the leaf rust and powdery mildew resistances were closely linked in the distal region of 2HS. A considerable variation in introgression size was observed at similar chromosomal sites among the different recombinants, which will provide useful information for map-based cloning of genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270200 Genetics::270209 Meiosis and recombination</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Class and occupational mobility among farm employees</field><field name="creator">Loveridge, Alison, 1955-</field><field name="description">Class mobility in farming works both ways, some farmer's children are unable to afford a farm, while others from non-farm families do succeed in farm ownership. The literature reviewed in this thesis suggests this situation is related to New Zealand's economic history. In the past small family farms have benefited from both secure markets and governments whose interests have been closely bound up with high productivity. This has led the state to offer cheap credit to prospective farmers with little cap1al of their own. Upward mobility has been possible, but at the same time state support has enabled relatively small farms to remain viable, and many of these are unable to secure farm ownership for all family members. In this thesis I explore class mobility and career patterns among farm employees and consider their wider implications. There are many ambiguities in farm employment in New Zealand which stem from the predominance of petty bourgeois farm owners. Such farmers must deal with the capitalist markets of other sectors when they purchase inputs or sell their product but family workers may act as a bulwark against commercial pressures by accepting lower incomes. Similar conditions may be forced on working class farm employees with no chance of ownership. The high number of people leaving farm employment offers indirect confirmation of such problems and this thesis investigates the context in which departures occurred. Farm employees consist of three groups, those without interest in farm ownership, those with an interest and little chance of success, and those whose family background ensures farm ownership. Many farms only have one employee and take on non-family labour for short periods when the family labour which would otherwise do the task is unavailable. Some of the people they employ are offspring of neighbouring farm owners. This variation in class interests has exacerbated the disinclination of farm employees to lake collective action in the face of poor wages and conditions. By tracing a sample of farm employees through the electoral rolls over a period of ten years, I have been able to contact three groups of farm employees: those who have left for non-farm work in the intervening period; those who have been farm workers for at least ten years; and those who have since become farm owners. This has given me an insight into the proportion of farm employees who take up farming hoping to own their own farm, and the problems involved in succeeding. People who have left farming also provide an important perspective on farm employment. I have correlated outcome of career by various background factors, principally father's occupation, aspiration, and education. Job history is also important to my analysis. All these factors influence class mobility, and may either increase or mask the action of each other in different circumstances. By looking at mobility I will demonstrate the way class relationships impinge on individual lives.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370100 Sociology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Sociology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Potential precursors to the development of phonological awareness in preschool children</field><field name="creator">Arrow, Alison Wendy</field><field name="description">Phonological awareness is one of the most important metacognitive skills needed for literacy development. However, the relationships between preschool phonological awareness and pre-literacy skills are only just beginning to be examined. An important area is the study of potential precursors to phonological awareness. The current research proposed that phonological awareness develops along a continuum of linguistic awareness beginning with syllables and moving towards the smallest level of the phoneme. In the current research, potential precursors were examined in two studies. The first study was an examination of preschool phonological awareness in a sample of 110 New Zealand four-year-old children with no formal literacy instruction but who had a range of pre-literacy skills including 12 children who could read one or more words. The second study examined how literacy instruction influenced the development of phoneme awareness by independently assessing the role of learning to read and the role of learning to spell by teaching non-readers to read 8 CVC words or to spell the same 8 CVC words, but not to read and spell. The results found that rime and phoneme awareness both contributed to a latent variable of phonological awareness and that they each had different potential precursors. Receptive vocabulary explained the most variance in rime awareness with a small association of letter-name knowledge and own-name spelling while rime awareness developed more in children who learnt new words in the intervention. Rime awareness contributed to phoneme awareness along with letter-sound knowledge. When children were taught to read using blending this led to task specific phoneme awareness gains only. Phoneme awareness did not contribute to word-learning in the experimental conditions, with the only learning occurring in the spelling conditions. Letter-name knowledge had a relationship with the acquisition of orthographic representations. Letter-sound knowledge had a relationship with phoneme and letter-level attempts at unfamiliar words. This suggests that children with good letter-name and letter-sound knowledge have both orthographic knowledge and alphabetic strategies available in early word reading and spelling. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications emphasising the role of alphabet knowledge in early literacy acquisition.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Balanced brains: an investigation of visuospatial ability and lateralization in musicians</field><field name="creator">Patston, Lucy</field><field name="description">Musicians comprise a unique population whereby persistent musical practice involving complex cognitive and motor tasks dates back to childhood when the potential for neural plasticity is at its highest. Accordingly, it has been speculated that musical training results in neural structural and functional differences between musicians and non-musicians. In particular, there is evidence to indicate parietal regions are more equally lateralized in musicians, but research investigating visuospatial abilities and lateralization in musicians is scarce. Studies 1 and 2 aimed to assess the visuospatial ability and cognitive processing speed of adult musicians versus &#8234;demographically and educationally matched non-musicians. &#8234;Musicians performed more quickly and more accurately than non-musicians in two tasks of visuospatial ability, and completed more items than non-musicians in three tasks of processing speed, suggesting &#8234;musicians had better &#8234;visuospatial ability and a faster speed of processing. Studies 3 and 4 aimed to investigate &#8234;visuospatial attention in &#8234;these groups using a line-bisection task and a visual discrimination task. On both tasks musicians demonstrated more balanced visuospatial attention with a slight bias to the right hemispace, which was in contrast to the non-musicians&#8217; bias to the left hemispace, a natural phenomenon known as &#8216;right pseudoneglect&#8217;. In Study 5, the laterality of visual processing in musicians and non-musicians was further investigated by comparing electrophysiological interhemispheric transfer time (IHTT) of lateralized visual stimuli across the corpus callosum. Non-musicians had faster right-to-left than left-to-right IHTT consistent with previous research, whilst musicians had more balanced IHTT in both directions and faster left-to-right transfer than non-musicians. Absolute latency patterns revealed similar results and consistently demonstrated more balanced visual processing in musicians. The behavioural data, analysed in Study 6, revealed a tendency (n.s.) for the &#8234;musician group to respond more quickly to stimuli presented in the right visual field than to stimuli presented in the left visual field, whilst &#8234;non-musicians did not show this pattern. Overall, the results indicate that musicians have enhanced visuospatial ability and are less lateralized for visuospatial attention and perception than non-musicians. The results are discussed in relation to plastic developmental changes that may be caused by extended musical training from childhood. Specifically, it is proposed that musical training in early life may elicit a process of myelination that is more bilaterally distributed than myelination in non-musicians.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">musician</field><field name="subject">visuospatial</field><field name="subject">laterality</field><field name="subject">N1</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeding the frontiers: logistical limitations of Roman imperialism in the West</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Christopher Felstead</field><field name="description">This thesis is an examination of the importance of army supply in deciding the success and failure of the frontiers of the Roman Empire with particular emphasis on those frontiers in the Rhine-Danube provinces. It will look at logistics as the reason for the end of expansion of the Roman Empire and the frontiers forming where they did. It will also argue that the failure of logistics was a major factor in the collapse of those same frontier defences and the ultimate fall of the western part of the empire. The need to feed and supply large numbers of troops and their dependents dictated where they could be based. Because of the impossibility of supplying the whole army with imported goods, the suitability of local land for food production was also paramount. The need to have reliable sources of supply locally was met by placing veterans on retirement in villae rusticae in frontier zones. This had the effect of controlling those local sources of supply and also satisfying the increasingly expensive needs of the army praemia militiae. The increased warfare and periodic invasions from the reign of Marcus Aurelius especially on the upper Rhine and upper Danube made supply more difficult. The army placed an increasing number of beneficiarii consularis on important points on the transport network to control and direct the flow of army supplies. The more frequent invasions across the frontiers from the third century caused greater dislocation to the agricultural infrastructure not only on the frontiers but deeper into the more settled and richer provinces. This destroyed the sources of local supply and also often the source of imported supply, forcing Roman armies to stay well inside the imperial boundaries more often than before. The loss of their logistic superiority spelt the loss of their military advantage, and the loss of empire.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430112 History: Classical Greek and Roman</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Ancient History)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological Indicators of Faecal Contamination in Aquatic Environments</field><field name="creator">Turner, Susan Jane</field><field name="description">1. The aim of this research was to determine appropriate microbial indicator systems for use in monitoring the occurrence and source of faecal contamination in aquatic environments. Particular emphasis has been placed on the identification of indicators which might enable faecal contamination of human origin to be distinguished from that of non-human derivation. Two lines of investigation have been pursued; the use of alternative microbial indicator systems for water quality monitoring, and the development of diagnostic molecular methods for identifying the origin of faecal organisms. 2. Field and treatment plant studies were undertaken to investigate the utility of three indicator systems for monitoring water quality impacts in the coastal area surrounding the discharge from Auckland's North Shore City wastewater treatment plant. F-specific bacteriophage (F-phage) and ratios of F-phage to enterococci and faecal coliforms were examined over a twelve month period in which indicator levels at various stages of the wastewater treatment process were measured. These indicators and levels of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediment were measured in four outfall impact studies. 3. F-phage levels in effluent from the treatment plant (median=2.5 x 102 cfu/l00 ml) were too low to enable their use as source-specific tracers of effluent dispersion. However, higher F-phage levels in raw sewage (median=6.2 x l05 cfu/l00 ml) suggested that phage may be an appropriate indicator of raw sewage contamination in the receiving environment. F-phage was detected in coastal waters remote from the sewage outfall, providing presumptive evidence of sewage contamination entering the sea from sources other than the outfall discharge itself. 4. F-phage/enterococci and F-phage/faecal coliform ratios that were determined for sewage and treated effluent derived from the North Shore plant proved to be highly variable and were therefore unreliable for determining the source faecal contamination. 5. The concentration of Clostridium perfringens spores in sediments did not provide a useful means for tracing the distribution of faecal contaminants in the coastal system because the spore levels were found to be similar throughout the study area. This widespread occurrence of C. perfringens spores prevented identification of defined impact zones for any of the potential sources of faecal contaminants examined. 6. Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was used to investigate whether genetic markers could be identified for Escherichia coli isolates derived from different sources. RAPD profiling was found to be a highly discriminative method able to subtype E. coli strains present in both sewage and in the wastewater stream of a mechanical wood-pulping operation. In the pulp mill effluent, RAPD analysis indicated the presence of a restricted range of E. coli strains compared to the range found in the water intake and sewage effluent discharges. The results obtained provide presumptive evidence for the multiplication of E. coli strains within the wastewater stream. 7. Comparison of RAPD profiles derived from a range of human and environmental E. coli isolates led to the identification of a 1.6-kb marker. present in a subset of human isolates, but found only infrequently in isolates from animal origin. Primers based on sequence information obtained from this region of the genome yielded a direct PCR assay for the 'human' marker. The reliability and utility of the assay was improved when fluorescently-labelled primers and an automated DNA detection system was employed for the analysis of the amplified PCR products. 8. The diagnostic polymorphism was localised to the region immediately downstream of the gene encoding the glycine decarboxylase P-protein (gcvP). Comparison of DNA sequences from this region in 'marker-positive' and 'marker-negative' E. coli isolates revealed an abrupt loss of homology immediately downstream of the transcription termination point of the gcvP gene. The region of non-homology extends for at least 130 base pairs beyond the gcvP transcription terminator. Sequences spanning this region in marker-negative isolates exhibited a high level homology with that determined for E. coli K-12. The origin of the sequence for the same region in marker-positive isolates was unable to be identified. 9. The utility of the marker for environmental monitoring was investigated in a field study of a rural stream receiving bacterial contamination of both human and animal origin. The marker was consistently detected both in isolates derived from sewage effluents and in those found immediately downstream from sewage inputs-despite the presence of a high background of E. coli of animal origin. However the utility of the marker as a sewage-specific tracer was limited by the relatively low numbers of marker-positive d. coli in sewage effluents (approximately 8%). 10. In summary, the work described in this thesis has confirmed the need for multiple indicator systems in water quality monitoring and has identified appropriate areas for further research. The most promising area for future research is in the development of molecular tools which might provide both a better understanding of genetic variation in indicator organisms and enable methods to be developed for the detection of host-specific strains. Location of other polymorphisms likely to be present in the E. coli genome should enable further host-specific markers to be identified which could complement the 'human' marker identified in this study.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::300000 Agricultural, Veterinary and Environmental Sciences::300800 Environmental Science</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Molecular Genetics and Microbiology (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological studies on turnip yellow mosaic virus in Brassica pekinensis</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Lena</field><field name="description">1.

Inoculation of a cotyledon leaf of Chinese cabbage seedlings with turnip yellow mosaic virus produced a rapid transient inhibition in the rate of leaf initiation, so that infected plants developed 0.5 to 1.0 leaf less than healthy plants. 3. The factor that initiated the inhibitory response a t the apical. meristem began moving out of the inoculated cotyledon within 1to 6 hours after inoculation, thus preceding the movement out of the inoculated cotyledon of infectious virus or RNA which was not detectable until about day 5. 4. The transient inhibition of leaf initiation occurred following inoculation with any one of three unrelated viruses, or with infectious turnip ye1low mosaic virus RNA. 5. A factor eluted in an active form from the cut petioles of inoculated 1eaves. 6. It is necessary to inoculate with infectious virus or RNA to initiate the production of the inhibitory factor. 7. No differences were seen in the magnitude or timing of the reduced rate of 1eaf initiation, when the concentration of turnip yellow mosaic virus in the inoculum was varied between 1 &#181; g/ml and 100 &#181;g/ml. 8. Inoculation of the cotyledons of Chinese cabbage seed1ings with turnip ye1low mosaic virus caused a marked disturbance in the mitotic index a t the apical meristem between 6 and 48 hours. 9. A reduction in the accumulation of starch in the chloroplasts of cell s in the apical meristem occurred at 6 t o 24 hours after inoculation of the cotyledon 1eaf. 10. Abscisic acid applied to the cotyledon in a single 20 &#181;1 dose, elicited a response that closely paralleled the events that took place when Chinese cabbage seedlings were inoculated with turnip yellow mosaic virus. A decrease in the rate of leaf initiation began 1 t o 2 days after application and the inhibition of leaf initiation was preceded by a disturbance in the mitotic index in the apical meristem. 11. Gibberellic acid applied with the eluate from virus-inoculated leaves, was able to overcome the inhibition of leaf initiation. 12. The leaf inhibition assay in Chinese cabbage seedlings is a sensitive bioassay for abscisic acid.

In the fourth part we trace the transformation of the Novelist into the political pundit, then we go back to La Grande peur des bien-pensants to retrace the origins of his political thinking. Chapter twelve, "Birth of the Modem World", traces the development of capitalism in France and concomitant evolution of the value-system and ways of thinking.

The lower molecular weight (&#946;-particle) glycogen was found to be extremely labile, while the higher molecular weight (&#945;-particle) exhibited a far lower metabolic activity, indicating that it may act as a glycogen store for mobilisation in stress situations. These observations, coupled to the existence of Pompe&#8217;s Disease, a glycogen storage disease involving the lysosomal system, supports the hypothesis that &#945; - and &#946; -particulate glycogen may be partially separated from one another within the cell i.e. compartmentalised. By the use of a rapid differential centrifugation technique it was possible to show, both physiochemically and ultrastructurally, the existence of glycogen of a very large molecular size associated with the lysosomal fraction. This glycogen exhibited a different molecular weight distribution from that isolate from the liver as a whole i.e. cytosol + lysosomal. It is suggested that appreciably more than 10% of cellular glycogen is located within the lysosomes and that this is of predominantly high molecular weight. The size-distribution of liver glycogen was shown to be distinctly affected by the anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylate and Indomethacin. By measurement of the incorporation of radioactive glucose into glycogen, salicylate was shown to have a depressing effect on overall liver glycogen metabolism. These effects appear to arise from a stabilisation of the lysosomal membrane by the drugs. The incorporation, via liposomes, of purified anti-1,4-&#945;-glucosidase antibodies into the liver lysosomes of normal Wistar rats and rats with a genetic deficiency of phosphorylase kinase, caused a distinct decrease in 1,4-&#945;-glucosidase activity and in the content of high molecular weight glycogen. These changes were enhanced by prolonged liposomal-antibody treatment and suggested that a possible feedback control mechanism operates in the incorporation of glycogen into lysosomes. The 1-4- &#945; -glucosidase inhibitor, Acarbose, when injected intraperitoneally into normal and phosphorylase kinase-deficient rats similarly disturbed liver lysosomal metabolism, causing distinct and persistent inhibition of enzymes and acute disturbances of lysosomal glycogen metabolism. Again a feedback control mechanism appears to operate, which effects cytosolic carbohydrate metabolism. The biochemical effects closely resembled those occurring in Pompe&#8217;s disease and were confirmed by electron microscopy. A model for the adult form of the lysosomal storage disease has been suggested.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland, 1985.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Par erruer: error analysis and the early stages of adolescent foreign language learning</field><field name="creator">Peddie, Roger</field><field name="description">Error Analysis has been widely used in studies of second language learning. At the same time, foreign language learning (as opposed to teaching), has largely been ignored as an object of research. The research had three major aims: to examine the potential of Error Analysis in foreign language learning by the development and trialling of a complex new coding schedule for analysing learner errors in French; to provide some descriptive data on the written errors and performance of foreign language pupils over a complete scholastic year; and to explore the nature of foreign language learning strategies used by the pupils studied. The thesis opens with a statement of purpose and method. This is followed by a short discussion of theories, topics and techniques in second and foreign language learning. The development of two forms of the coding schedule used to analyse errors is described and discussed. Recode checks and the development of 'Coding Confidence Levels' are presented. Procedures used in a longitudinal study of errors are then described. This study acted as an important trial for the coding schedules, known as Foreign Language Error Analysis: French (FLEAF). All written French produced by eight pupils in the same school class was collected over the 1978 New Zealand school year (February to December). The group were in their second year of high school French and had an average age of 14 years 5 months midway through the study. Background information is given about the subjects, including results of selected IEA French (Population II) tests administered during the year. Some description of the year's work is given, followed by general and case study analyses of errors. Selected results from both the longer (FLEAF-L) and shorter (FLEAF-S) coding schedules are then tabulated and discussed. Particular attention is paid to variables coding possible explanations for errors. Detailed analyses of errors in word order, negation and gender are offered, along with a review of correct performances for selected aspects. These analyses lead to two preliminary hypotheses which could in part explain the occurrence of errors. One hypothesis relates to the frequency with which pupils had been required to focus through drills on the point at issue, the other to the number of choices available to the pupil at the time of error. Discussion of Error Analysis and pupil strategies is then presented. It is concluded that Error Analysis has a valid role in developing hypotheses for a theory of foreign language learning. Five such hypotheses, suggested by the longitudinal study, are presented. It is argued that these five could all be classified on one of a proposed five levels of 'Operating Procedures' (McLaughlin, 1978a). Selection of a unique cluster of operating procedures would constitute the learning/performance 'strategy' of a particular pupil. These notions are incorporated into a tentative framework for a theory of foreign language learning. A modified 'Principle of Least Effort' (Zipf, 1965), is suggested as a key factor in the early stages of learning a foreign language, and ideas for subsequent research are proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420100 Language Studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Error and self-correction in reading and oral language</field><field name="creator">Ng, Seok Moi</field><field name="description">The aim of this one year descriptive longitudinal study was to investigate the efficient strategies some competent novice readers used while learning to read in an existing reading programme for which text reading was the main instructional task.

Other important questions of the study related to whether children in such a programme could read not only unseen classroom texts, but also texts from a programme with a decoding emphasis. Fifty-two competent readers were chosen by a stratified random sampling method from 242 six-year-old children attending 20 randomly selected schools in Auckland. Strategy usage in oral reading was related to 3 factors: learning opportunities over time, (at 6:0, 6:6 and 7:0); reader proficiency, (Average, High Average, Good and Excellent); and text difficulty, (Easy, Moderately Difficult, Difficult and Phonically Regular). The children&#8217;s performances on oral reading and an oral sentence repetition test at 6:0 and 7:0 were compared. The data comprising errors and self corrections were analyzed at three linguistic levels (graphemic/phonemic, syntactic and semantic), to infer strategies. The Friedman two-way analysis of variance test for related samples was used for most comparisons. Th level of significance was set at p&lt;0.05. The findings suggest that the Auckland child used the facilitating effects of meaning and structure in both reading and sentence repetition tasks. The control which children gained from 6:0 to 7:0 over texts with the decoding emphasis was achieved by attention to both graphemic cues and cues from structure and meaning. The competent novice reader also showed flexibility in selecting different strategies to deal with easy, familiar texts and difficult or novel texts. Such strategies are a necessary part of a model of mature reading which dies not see reading as exclusively the use of anticipatory mechanisms nor solely the use of sequential letter-by-letter processing. The competent novice reader was apparently learning to use either, or combinations, of these processes. The results of the study highlight the complex nature of learning to read and suggest that while some teaching programmes that emphasize a particular learning strategy may be successful, they may not take full advantage of other equally valid strategies which children can develop.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene sequencing and in vitro synthesis of the rotavirus non-structural glycoprotein</field><field name="creator">Powell, Kevin F. H. (Kevin Frederick Herbert)</field><field name="description">1. Recombinant DNA techniques have been applied to the dsRNA genome of the bovine rotavirus Nebraska Calf Scours Diarrhoea virus (NCDV). The sequence of a full - length cloned copy of genomic segment 10 of NCDV has been determined using the Sanger dideoxynucleoside sequencing technique by subcloning cDNA into M13 vectors. 2. Genomic segment 10 codes for the non-structural protein NCVP5, a protein which appears to be involved in virus maturation (Estes et al., 1983). Determination of the nucleic acid sequence of the gene has enabled the amino acid sequence o f the bovine NCVPS protein to be inferred. Comparison of the inferred amino acid sequence with homologous sequences derived from other virus strains (Both et al., 1983c; Baybutt and McCrae, 1984; Okada et al., 1984; Ward et al., 1985) has enabled conserved regions of the molecule to be identified. A small region of the NCVPS protein has been identified (residues 131-161) which exhibits considerable variability between rotavirus strains. 3. A computer-based algorithm has been utilised to predict the folding pattern of NCDV gene 10 mRNA. This reveals a 'panhandle ' structure which differs from that proposed for the related gene of strain Wa rotavirus (Okada et al., 1984) but both molecules possess a common feature in that the initiation codon falls within a potentially-stable duplex formed with a portion of the 3 untranslated region. 4. A series of four site-directed deletion mutants of the cloned gene were constructed in order to investigate the functional significance of the three N-terminal hydrophobic regions of the NCVP5 protein. Two mutants were constructed using conveniently-located HindIII and BamHI restriction enzyme sites. The other two mutants were generated using M13 vectors and synthetic oligonucleotides. These modifications yielded genes coding for proteins in which portions of the first and second hydrophobic regions had been deleted. 5. DNA corresponding to the 'wild-type' coding region was inserted into an SP6 transcription vector to enable mRNA to be produced in vitro. This mRNA, when incubated in a reticulocyte lysate, directed the synthesis of a protein of the correct size (20 K). The addition of dog pancreatic microsomes to the reaction yielded a protein product (29 K) of a size consistent with the glycosylated ('wild-type') form of the NCVP5 protein. 6. The four variant forms of the NCVP5 gene were also inserted into SP6 transcription vectors and the protein products synthesised by the resulting mRNAs studied. All four mRNAs directed synthesis of variant protein products of the anticipated size. 7. The ability of the four variant proteins to become glycosylated and to associate with membranes was investigated. The topology of the proteins in the membrane was examined by digestion with proteolytic enzymes. Variant proteins altered in the first or second hydrophobic regions retained their ability to associate with membranes, suggesting that the third hydrophobic region, which was not altered, might play a role in membrane association. 8. A model for the disposition of NCVPS in the endoplasmic reticulum is proposed in which the first hydrophobic region is located within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the second hydrophobic region spans the membrane and the third hydrophobic sequence associates independently with the membrane from the cytoplasmic side leaving the C-terminus of the molecule exposed to the cytoplasm. The model proposed accounts for the experimental observations but is in conflict with current mechanisms proposed for the insertion of proteins into membranes.

Don seedlings were studied. Sampling procedures were compared in the search of soils for fungal propagules. Those most frequently used were soil dilution plate method, surface-soil dilution plate technique, and plating of debris picked from soil. A selective medium for direct isolation from soil was prepared comprising potato dextrose agar as the basal medium and incorporating benomyl (50 ppm), quintozene (7.5 or 75 ppm), streptomycin sulfate (100 ppm), chloramphenicol (100 ppm) and chlortetracycline HCl (100 ppm). Studies in plots at Auckland, Tokoroa and Rotorua indicated that fungal structures within P. radiata debris persisted for long periods; up to 25 months in the Auckland plots. In vitro, the viability of conidia in natural soil declined very rapidly; more than 50% of conidia were non-viable within 4 weeks of their introduction into soil incubated at 15 and 25 C. Similar experiments conducted at different matric potentials indicated that drier soils (-0.3 or -0.4 bar) had higher levels of viable conidia over periods of time compared to wetter soils of -0.1 bar or at saturation. Segments of pine seedlings introduced to soils into which various concentrations of conidia were previously incorporated showed increasing colonization with increasing conidial concentration at both 15 and 25 C after 4 days. Maximum colonization of segments occurred at conidial concentrations 106 ml-1 to 107 ml-1. Artificially-inoculated segments of pine seedlings were introduced into soil and then these were recovered at different time periods. After two months in soil 100% recovery of the fungus was obtained from all leaf, stem and root segments plated. Recovery levels from all the plated stem and root segments after 8.5 months were never lower than 68%. Recovery levels from leaf segments were lower because many of these had decomposed leaving only the central xylem strands. Conidia-laden membrane filters were introduced into soil. A method of microscopic study used after removal of these from soil enabled easy observation of resultant structures. Appressoria were formed while the fungus was in soil. Other potential survival propagules were thick-walled, darkly-pigmented, short hyphae within pine debris. It is considered that the short individual cells of such hyphae could survive as chlamydospores, and these are believed to be the prime means of long-term survival in soil. Several fumigants were tested for effectiveness in eradication of the fungus from soil. All chemicals tested, namely chloropicrin, methyl bromide, "Di-Trapex" and dazomet significantly reduced viability of conidia and the fungus in pine debris. Weeds from a pine nursery were inoculated with conidia; of these, only Epilobium ciliatum Raf. became infected. Infection of healthy parts was infrequent but saprophytic growth in older parts frequently killed the plant. This species is therefore a potential alternative host, although its importance as an inoculum source for infection of pine seedlings is unknown. Experimentally it was shown that infection could occur by rain splash of conidia onto healthy plants. Infection of P. radiata seedlings was studied at several constant and alternating temperatures. Initial infection was greatest at higher temperatures (ca 24 C); while full symptoms of the disease were best expressed at lower temperatures (12 to 18 C). Inoculated seedlings had significantly reduced shoot and root development at 12, 15, 18 C, but not at 6, 9, 23, 24, 27 C, after 53 days. Increase in height of healthy seedlings was significantly greater than that of inoculated seedlings, after 52 days at 18 C. Pathogenicity on P. radiata seedlings of an isolate of C. acutatum f.sp. pinea isolated from soil, "whitish isolate", was comparable to the normal "coloured isolate".</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2388</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic Studies Towards the Crisamicins</field><field name="creator">Lai, Michelle Yu Huay</field><field name="description">This thesis describes synthetic work directed towards the synthesis of the dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone antibiotic crisamicin A 1.46 and its regioisomer 2.77. The synthetic strategy adopted is based on a double furofuran annulation/oxidative rearrangement strategy that has been successfully used by this research group to prepare a related dimeric pyranonaphthoquinone based on the actinorhodin skeleton. The retrosynthesis that was adopted (see Scheme 1.47, page 59) required the initial preparation of a key bis-naphthoquinone 1.267 which in turn is available from bisnaphthalene 1.268 that bears acetyl groups at C-7 and C-7&#8217;. Initial work concentrated on the construction of the biaryl linkage of bis-7- acetylnaphthalene 1.268 using a palladium(0)-mediated Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the key triflate 1.269 (prepared in 10 steps from vanillin 1.271) using bis(pinacolato)diboron 1.179. This coupling method successfully afforded binaphthyls 2.8b and 2.8d which were subjected to attempts to effect either double bromination, double acetylation or double Fries rearrangement to a more functionalised biaryl system. Disappointingly, none of these methods allowed introduction of the key acetyl group at C-7 and C-7&#8217; onto the initial biaryls 2.8b and 2.8d. Attention then turned to the synthesis of the bis-7-acetylnaphthalene 1,268 that was required for the ensuing furofuran annulation reaction starting from triflate 2.7 that already contained an acetyl group at C-7, then effecting formation of the key biaryl linkage. Attempts to prepare 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 via either Fries rearrangement of acetates 2.33a or 2.9a, or via bromination of acetate 2.33a, naphthol 2.56 or benzyl ether 2.6 were unsuccessful. An alternative approach for the preparation of 7-acetyltriflate 2.7 involved the preparation of 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74 from carbamate 2.64 via a directed ortho-metalation, followed by reaction of the derived ortho-lithiated species with N-methoxy-N-methylacetamide 2.71. However, this strategy resulted only in low yields of the desired 2-acetylcarbamate 2.74, although initial model work did provide methodology for the successful conversion of carbamate 2.68 to 2-acetyl-l-naphthol 2.73. The synthetic target of this thesis shifted to the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 when attempts to introduce an acetyl group atC-7 of triflate 2.9 failed. However formation of the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b was successful from triflate 2.9b. A subsequent one-pot in situ Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of triflate 2.81b with boronate 2.89 furnished dimmer 2.76b. Oxidation of dimer 2.76b to bis-naphthoquinone 2.80 was then accomplished using silver(II) oxide and 6 M nitric acid. With the key bis-6-acetylnaphthoquinone 2.80 in hand, an efficient double furofuran annulation reaction was carried out using 2-trimethylsilyloxyfuran 1.88 affording the desired bis-furonaphthofuran adduct 2.79 as an inseparable l:l mixture of diastereomers 2.79a and 2.79b. However, initial experiments to effect the double oxidative rearrangement of bis-furonaphthofuran adducts 2.79 using either silver(Il) oxide and 6 M nitric acid or with ceric ammonium nitrate in aqueous acetonitrile to the bisfuronaphthopyran 2.7 8 were unsuccessful. Attention then turned to the preparation of bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78 from the 6-acetyltriflate 2.81b via initial oxidation of triflate 2.81b to naphthoquinone 3.3 followed by furofuran annulation and then oxidative rearrangement. Attempts to effect the key Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of furonaphthofuran 3.2 to bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79, or of furonaphthopyran 3.1 to bis-furonaphthopyran 2.78, using catalyst PdCl2(dppf) and ligand dppf were unsuccessful. The work achieved herein constitutes the synthesis of an advanced intermediate for the synthesis of the crisamicin analogue 2.79. The final synthesis of the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77 can be completed by preparing bis-furonaphthopyran bis-lactol 2.78 using more powerful palladium(0) catalysts and ligands for the Suzuki-Miyaura homocoupling of the monomeric furonaphthopyran 3.1. Subsequent reduction af 2.78 using triethylsilane and trifluoroacetic acid will then afford the bis-cyclic ether 3.15, which can undergo deprotection of the methyl ether and epimerisation at C-5 upon treatment with excess boron tribromide to finally furnish the regioisomer of crisamicin A 2.77. An investigation into the double oxidative rearangement of bis-furonaphthofuran 2.79 to the bis-lactol 2.78 could also be carried out by the use of several alternative oxidising agents, such as phenyliodine(III) bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA), phenyliodine(III) diacetate (PIDA), polymer-supported (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (PSDIB), Fremy's salt, iron trichloride or CrO3.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2393</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Happily ever after:  Discourses of emotion, love and health in the intimate relationships of young adult New Zealanders</field><field name="creator">McKenzie, Donna Margaret</field><field name="description">Young people are often constructed in academic and lay explanations as an inherently risky population. They are the age group most likely to feature in public health statistics, especially those of intentional and unintentional injury. A common risk factor cited in these statistics is conflict within or breakdown of an inter-personal relationship, in particular intimate heterosexual relationships. Intimate relationships serve as markers of normal adulthood in New Zealand society, and many young people invest significantly in them for their emotional and material rewards. This study investigated the social processes and experiences that influence young adult New Zealanders' perceptions of their own and others' intimate relationships. It employed an inter-disciplinary framework of critical interpretive medical anthropology and a public health approach with a lifecourse perspective. A multi-interview method was used involving more than 90 people interviewed either in focus groups, as couples, or as individuals. Interviews focused on young people's ideas and experiences of healthy and unhealthy relationships, as well as the influence of families, friends, and popular culture on relationships.    Intimate relationships are based on naturalised gender differences that work to construct men as masculine/active and women as feminine/passive and hide disparities based on gender within a discourse of equality. The ideal healthy relationship is based on ideas of individualism, emotional and material inter-dependence, and the addition of other social networks into a partner relationship. Families are primary sources of information about and models for relationships. Friends are significant in establishing an adult identity separate to one's parents. Both families and friends are emotional safety nets in times of relationship difficulties. Understandings of popular culture and its products are most commonly experienced through gendered romantic narratives. Because of their ubiquity and popularity, information produced by mass media is particularly influential for young people.    Overall, young people reported that relationships are a considerable source of joy to them. However, when problems occur, they tend to revert to stereotypical and gendered cultural scripts rather than relying on individual knowledge. To mitigate the possible negative effects of these scripts, knowledge of the skills required to overcome relationships difficulties need to be made explicit and fostered by relevant public health and education policy and promotion activities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/24</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental analysis of the psychological effect of head injury</field><field name="creator">Gronwall, D. M. A. (Dorothy M. A.)</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to investigate the immediate consequences of concussion. Previous work had either concentrated on memory defects only, included cases of cerebral damage as well as concussion, or examined residual defects persisting after the period of impaired consciousness had ended. It was hoped to determine which function or functions might be affected in concussion by testing only young adult cases of 'pure' concussion in the immediate post-traumatic period. In the main experiment a paced serial addition task was administered to a mildly concussed (MC) and seriously concussed (SC) group at twenty-four-hourly intervals during the hospital period, and thirty to forty days after discharge. A normal control and hospital control group were given the task at similar time intervals. Recent concussion impaired performance and SC Ss needed almost five times as long as controls to process each correct response while MC Ss were about twenty per cent slower, However, responses were qualitatively similar in all groups, and concussed Ss differed only in producing many more late response errors. At retest the MC group had regained control level, but although SC Ss had significantly improved PASAT scores they were still poorer than the other three groups. Experiments II and III investigated stages in the information transmission process which may have produced restricted information processing shown by PASAT results. Reaction and movement times were not longer than normal, although central processing time was. MC Ss did not have significantly slower non-symbolic RTs, or symbolic two- and four-choice RTs, but they differed significantly from controls on eight- and ten-choice symbolic trials. Again this difference between groups was not found at retest four weeks later. Results suggested inefficient 'pigeon-holing' (Broadbent, 1971) as a possible factor in reduced information transmission following concussion. However, a message repetition task indicated no difference between concussed and non-concussed Ss in use of this mechanism. Message repetition also demonstrated that patients had no difficulty in auditory perception of verbal material. In the third stage, normal Ss were given message repetition with and without a concurrent distracting task. Performance during distraction was sufficiently similar to that of recently concussed Ss to suggest that the patient group may have been poorer than controls on the same task only because they also had reduced processing capacity. When given PASAT with a secondary paced task, performance of another group of normal Ss was almost identical to concussed Ss in the first experiment. Finally, to test the possibility that reduced processing capacity was the result of increased distractability, that is, processing task-irrelevant stimuli, an attention task (speech shadowing) was given to a small group of MC Ss and normal controls. There were no instances of intrusions or interference from an irrelevant message to indicate a defect in selective attention, although MC Ss had significantly lower shadowing scores. It was concluded that reduction in processing capacity produced by concussion was a function of patients' lower level of arousal, and that performance resembled that reported in the literature from sleep-deprived Ss and cases of brain-stem damage or dysfunction. A feature of results was the extremely competent performance exhibited by concussion patients, given a reduction in total capacity. Similar optimizing behaviour was evident during distraction tasks, and it was suggested that ability to monitor and control distribution of available processing space by instructions ('set') is a general characteristic of ordered behaviour. This ability was not disturbed by degrees of concussion sustained by experimental Ss in this study. Amnesic symptoms of the immediate post-traumatic period were considered in terms of lowered arousal level. It was proposed that these might be explained by a combination of two factors: (i) processing space insufficient to store items while responding to them, and (ii) tagging of items in storage with levels of concurrent background activity, and thus 'state-dependent' memory. Evidence for a processing deficit existing after termination of the period of PTA was reviewed, and the possibility of permanent effect in terms of increased disability following repeated concussions. Some aspects of results important in considering rehabilitation programmes for head-injured patients were noted.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 1972.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disclosure Rules, Manager Discretion and the Relative Informativeness of Earnings Components</field><field name="creator">Teixeira, Alan</field><field name="description">This is a study of earnings quality, examining whether components of earnings based on New Zealand (N.Z.) accounting classification systems have different information parameters. The N.Z. environment provides a unique opportunity to examine a period with no legislative backing of accounting standards and a flexible accounting standard. Combined, this gave mangers the ability to clearly identify earnings components they considered to be differentially informative. Informativeness is assessed by the ability of current period earnings to predict next period earnings and the contemporaneous relation between returns and earnings. The results indicate that disaggregated reported earnings are more informative than aggregated earnings in a non-trivial way. In one of the sample periods disaggregated earnings explained 29% of the variance in returns, more than twice the explanatory power of aggregated earnings. N.Z. accounting standard setters replaced SSAP7 with FRS7 in 1994 contending that the discretion available to mangers reduced the informativeness of earnings. Not only do the results not support that contention but earnings informativeness has fallen since FRS7 came into effect, suggesting that standard setters should revisit that decision. The results also have implications for the content and form of the N.Z. Stock Exchange (NZSE) preliminary announcement. "Unusual earnings" reported to the NZSE by companies are shown to be differentially informative to investors yet the NZSE does not always identify these components when the preliminary announcement is summarised and disseminated to market participants. To summarise, the effective codification of earnings brought about by FRS7 has reduced the informativeness of earnings &#8211; locking differences between components into total earnings. The N.Z. results beg the question as to whether similar economic events are locked into the COMPUSTAT summary earnings variables for U.S. data.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services::350100 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Accounting and Finance)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the etiology of the leaf blotch disease of Eucalyptus spp. caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke) Hansf</field><field name="creator">Ganapathi, Alhagananthan</field><field name="description">A detailed study of the leaf blotch disease, caused by Mycosphaerella nubilosa (Cke.) Hansf. on Eucalyptus regnans F. Muell (Mountain Ash) and E. delegatensis R.T. Baker (Syn. E. gigantea Hook. F., Alpine Ash) was made. The taxonomy of the fungus was studied(illustrations provided) and a previously unidentified imperfect state (Colletogloeum nubilosum) was described along with the spermagonial state (Asteromella). The histology and mode of infection process by ascospores and conidia was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy, and wax and epoxy resin sections. The development of the fungus within the host was studied up to the stage of mature pseudothecia. The fungus was isolated from diseased tissue and Koch's postulates were carried out to prove pathogenicity. Detailed development of the leaf blotch and twig canker symptoms was followed in the field and in glasshouse conditions. The effect of substrate and environmental conditions on growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. Controlled environment chambers and glasshouses were used. Several day/night temperature combinations (12/6, 18/12, 24/18 and 30/24C) as well as several light levels (50, 75, 150, 200, 300 and 650 &#956;E) were investigated. The optimum temperature for infection was 24/18C and least infection occurred at 12/6C. The optimum light level for infection was 300 to 650 &#956;E while the slowest infection was obtained at 50 and 75 &#956;E. Under constant temperature conditions infection was most severe at 18C for both E. delegatensis and E. regnans. Wetness periods under sprinklers of one to seven days were compared with similar incubation periods in polythene bags. One-day incubation produced very little infection compared with 2, 4 or 7 days. Incubation in polythene bags gave better results than sprinklers. Experiments showed that leaf and stem infection was not affected by nutrient levels. Leaf expansion rates for both the eucalypt species were followed for twelve weeks to determine the optimum leaf size for infection. Fungicide trials in the field and in-vitro suggested that several chemotherapeutants may be effective in controlling the disease. Diseased leaves from field trials were assessed for ascospore discharge to determine fungal viability. From this study it was shown that diseased (inoculated)"plants lost significantly more leaves than controls. If conditions were optimum for infection, tips of inoculated plants were killed, leading to stem distortion, branching and reduced growth. In general, the fungus causes severe damage on susceptible Eucalyptus spp. in sapling stages.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany::270403 Plant pathology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2402</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytokinins and the division or expansion of plant cells</field><field name="creator">Beuning, Lesley L.</field><field name="description">The effect of cytokinins was studied in three systems: the alga Chlorella, callus cultures and etiolated cucumber cotyledons. In Chlorella cultures: 1) A range of concentrations of 6BA and IP had no effect on growth; 2) Low concentrations of an anticytokinin had no effect on growth, whereas higher concentrations appeared to be inhibitory. 3) Characterisation of the Chlorella species suggested that it was surrounded by an impermeable sporopollenin layer which hindered the uptake of cytokinin. 4) The uptake of radioactive adenine occurred readily, whereas the uptake of radioactive 6BA was very slow in both growing and saturated cultures of Chlorella. 5) Extracts isolated from Chlorella and the medium in which Chlorella was growing contained cytokinin-like activity in two bioassays. 6) HPLC analyses of these extracts showed that there were fractions which eluted at the positions of IP and IPA. In callus cultures: A.1) A carrot callus was grown from the secondary phloem of the storage root of carrot. 2) This callus, which was grown on 2,4-D and kinetin, produced roots and shoots when subcultured onto IAA and kinetin. 3) Growth on 2,4-D alone was independent of the presence of kinetin. 4) Growth was inhibited in the presence of an anticytokinin, suggesting that the callus produced a cytokinin. B.1) A tobacco callus was grown from a young leaf of tobacco. 2) This callus habituated to cytokinin independence following subculture onto lower concentrations of kinetin. 3) Subculture of the habituated callus onto a higher concentration of kinetin resulted in the production of roots and shoots. C.1) Cytokinin-dependent soybean and tobacco callus cultures were obtained from the Botany Department, University of Otago. 2) Analysis of the total proteins from suspension and callus cultures of soybean by 1-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed one small 6BA-induced change in the proteins from the suspension cultures. In etiolated cucumber cotyledons: 1) 6BA caused the expansion of excised etiolated cucumber cotyledons after a 24h-hour incubation in the dark in a solution containing 6BA, in comparison to cotyledons incubated in water only. 2) The cotyledons curved upwards and in the light microscope the cells of the vascular bundles and the lower epidermis exhibited greater expansion than the upper epidermis. 3) Electron microscopic examination showed that the central vacuole of palisade cells from cotyledons treated with 6BA had expanded and that the cytoplasm had probably lost water and was compressed by the vacuole against the cell wall. 4) In contrast to other research, there was no apparent increase in polysome formation in 6BA-treated cotyledons in comparison to untreated cotyledons examined in the electron microscope. 5) A number of protein extraction methods were tried before a method was found which produced a protein extract suitable for both 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses. 6) 1-D and 2-D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that a number of proteins either increased or decreased following the treatment of cotyledons with 6BA. 7) A number of RNA extraction methods were tried, to obtain RNA suitable for translation in vitro. Only one method produced RNA which appeared to be free of contaminating substances. Weak translation of this RNA was obtained in vitro and it might be possible to develop conditions for optimal translation of the RNA given an adequate supply of an in vitro translation system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cell Biology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dehydrochlorination of 1,1-diaryl-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in protic and dipolar aprotic solvents</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ronald James</field><field name="description">PART I A general introduction is given to the mechanisms of olefin-forming &#946;-elimination. The development of mechanistic criteria and their application to the various reactions is discussed. Conflicting theories concerning the nature of the transition states of E2H reactions in protic solvents as well as the Winstein-Parker E2C-like transitions states for elimination by weak bases in dipolar aprotic solvents are described. PART II The use of primary deuterium isotope effects: structure-reactivity relationships, and rate-acidity correlations as mechanistic criteria for the E2 mechanism and the variants of the E1cB mechanism is reviewed. These criteria have been applied to the dehydrochlorination of the 1,1-diaryl-2, 2, 2-trichloroethanes (DDT-type compounds) with methoxide-methanol and t-butoxide-t-butanol. Literature comparisons indicate that the kinetic evidence for these two systems is in accord with an "irreversible" E1cB elimination pathway. PART III Characteristics of weak base-promoted eliminations in dipolar aprotic advents are reviewed. The evidence is not entirely consistent with either E2C or the E2H mechanism. Deuterium isotope effects and equilibrium constants are reported for the chloride ion-promoted elimination of the 1, 1-diary1-2,2,2-trichloroethanes in dimethylformamide and acetone respectively. The results are in accord with an E2H mechanism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1973.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl complexes of iridium</field><field name="creator">Town, Keith Gregory</field><field name="description">The results to be described and discussed in this thesis concern synthesis and reactivity of iridium(I) and (III) complexes containing thiocarbonyl or selenocarbonyl ligands. Chapter 1 comprises: a review of Vaska's compound, IrCl(CO) (PPh3)2 and related species, covering syntheses, structure and bonding and reactions of this very widely studied moiety; and brief reviews of metal-thiocarbonyl syntheses and reactions and metal-selenocarbonyl chemistry. These three reviews background the themes developed in this work; of preparations and reactions, particularly ligand reactions, of thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl analogues of Vaska's compound and species derived from IrCl(CE)(PPh3)2, E = S, Se. A new synthesis of IrCl(CS)(PPh3)2 is described in Chapter 2. The route employed involves preparation of dithioester complexes and facets of the reactivity of these species have been considered and a number of metallocycle derivatives prepared. Reductions of coordinated-thiocarbonyl groups have been considered; IrH(CS)(PPh3)3 was transformed into IrH2(SMe)(PPh3)3 by treatment with hydrogen, while the thiocarbonyl cation complexes [IrClX(CO)(CS)-(PPh3)2]+ were treated with borohydride to afford thioformyl species. Iridium alkyl, thiocarbonyl complexes have been prepared, and transformed by reaction with dithiocarbamate ion to yield monohapto-thioacetyl derivatives. The preparation of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2, the selenocarbonyl analogue of Vaska's compound is reported in Chapter 3. The synthesis utilizes carbon diselenide as the selenocarbonyl source, and involves a four-step conversion of a dihapto-carbon diselenide adduct complex to the iridium(I) selenocarbonyl species. Reactions of a range of iridium(I) complexes with carbon diselenide are described, including the preparation of a complex including three CSe2 groups. Reactions of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 have been studied and several iridium(I) and (III) selenocarbonyl compounds prepared. The ready reduction of IrCl(CSe)(PPh3)2 (in the presence of phosphine) by borohydride to give IrH2(SeMe)(PPh3)3 is described and comparisons are drawn between the relative reactivities of iridium thiocarbonyl and selenocarbonyl groups, in analogous species, with nucleophiles. It is concluded the Ir-CSe system is more reactive under similar conditions. Metallocycle derivatives of iridium selenocarbonyl, diselenomethylester complexes have been characterised.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystal studies of some organic natural products and inorganic compounds of structural interest</field><field name="creator">Brown, Kevin L.

A study o f the petrological variation in these northern islands provides a basis for the development of a petrogenetic-tectonic model which is applicable to most, if not all, the Central Chain islands. Integration of petrographic, mineralogical and geochemical data on each island in the Banks Group has revealed a systematic petrological variation across the islands, represented chemically by a decrease in K20 (and related incompatible elements) away from the New Hebrides trench. The correlation with depth to the Benioff zone is therefore the reverse of that typically found in island arcs. REE evidence and source modelling based on this data indicates that this variation represents a progressive depletion in LREE/HREE in the upper mantle, laterally away from the trench. The variation also represents a progressive increase in partial melting of the source, in the same direction. However partial melting differences alone could not produce the observed variation. The variation in source composition and degree of partial melting are blended in to a model in which the compositional variation is attributed to an earlier west-facing Miocene subduction event, and the variation in degree of partial melting is a function of the location of the islands with respect to the postulated heat source: the active back-arc basin. The enrichment of the upper mantle in the Miocene is ascribed to the ascent of hydrous fluids enriched in incompatible elements, from the west-dipping Benioff zone, and subsequent reaction with the overlying upper mantle. The model thus envisages approximately contemporaneous development of the Central Chain volcanoes and the back-arc basin in the late Pliocene, with partial melting of hydrous, laterally zoned upper mantle resulting from the convective thermal regime associated with the rifting apart of the back-arc basin. The role of the present subduction regime in magma generation is considered very limited. The mineralogical and geochemical data show that all compositions in the range from basaltic andesite to dacite (ie. &gt; 53wt.% SiO2) in the Banks Islands can be derived from basalts by fractional crystallization of the observed phenocryst phases (including magnetite in the Gaua suite), after allowances have been made for inherited differences between some melt fractions. Together with the paucity of andesites in the Central Chain, this suggests that the primary melts of the Pliocene - Recent volcanism are basaltic. The generation of calc-alkaline magmas in the early Miocene are also believed to have involved basaltic primary melts as both the Miocene Eastern and Western belts are dominantly basaltic.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Utilization of diterpenoids in synthesis</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Brian D.</field><field name="description">The first part of this thesis describes the use of several diterpenoids which are readily available in New Zealand for the synthesis of compounds possessing ambergris-type odours.

The first type is an intensely coloured species based on the ligand oxalyldihydrazide. The divalent metal and the ligand react together with simple carbonyl compounds and molecular oxygen in basic conditions to form blue species the nature of which has been the subject of conjecture for many years. This work shows that the metal is trivalent in the highly coloured states and that it acts as an oxidative catalyst with ascorbic acid. The copper (III)/copper (II) potential has been established as +0.244V by polarography. Compounds including acetaldehyde and acetone as the carbonyl component have been crystallized in monoclinic space groups. In both instances X-ray diffraction studies show that the metal is co-ordinated to a 6-5-6-5 macrocycle formed by a condensation reaction between two oxalyldihydrazide molecules and two carbonyl moieties. The co-ordination is via four deprotonated 'amide' nitrogen atoms and is of square-planar geometry. A structural study of oxalyldihydrazide has also been undertaken and comparisons are made with the co-ordinated species. The second type of compound studied is a Cu4OX6L4 cluster. It was made from a copper(I) precursor and studies with oxygen-18 gas show that formation requires oxidation to copper(II) followed by hydrolysis. Infrared evidence based on the Cu-O stretch (500-580 cm-1) is presented. Attempts to include both fluorine and iodine as the halogen component suggest that only chlorine and bromine may fill such a role.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on the reduction of formaldehyde emission from particleboard by polymers</field><field name="creator">Kazakevics, Arnis Aris Rolands.</field><field name="description">Formaldehyde is an important industrial chemical due to its unique properties, coupled with its low cost and the basic availability of the raw materials from which it is produced. It is generated principally by the catalytic oxidation of methanol using a heated stationary catalyst at approximately atmospheric pressure. Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of a wide variety of commercial products, the most significant of which in New Zealand, are the urea-formaldehyde resins. Such resins are used in the production of reconstituted wood products such as: particleboard; medium density fibreboard; plywood; laminated and finger jointed wood products; and in the modification of textiles and papers. Insulating building foams have also been formulated using urea-formaldehyde resins. Formaldehyde release from products containing urea-formaldehyde adhesives has been well documented in the literature over recent years. It has been shown that in some instances the levels of airborne formaldehyde inside dwellings and commercial premises may exceed various industrial threshold limit values for an eight hour working day. In New Zealand the current industrial permissible time weighted average value for formaldehyde in air is set at a maximum level of 2 ppm (2.4 mg of formaldehyde per metre3 of air). Natural levels of formaldehyde in air do exist and have been measured as being in the vicinity of 0.12 to 0.39 parts per billion. In terms of being a health hazard, formaldehyde was found to be a primary irritant of the respiratory airways and a skin sensitizer in some individuals. Some suggestion has been made that formaldehyde can also be carcinogenic. This suggestion should be treated with caution as it derives from preliminary experiments on rats and mice exposed to very high formaldehyde levels. Over the years a variety of test methods have been applied to the measurement of formaldehyde which is released from formaldehyde-bearing materials. A dynamic testing method, in the form of a wind-tunnel was adopted in this study for measuring the emission rate of formaldehyde directly from the surfaces of urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard. Emissions were quantified in terms of the weight of formaldehyde emitted in mg from one square metre of panel surface over one hour, under the prevailing climatic conditions. It was observed that formaldehyde emissions were as great as about 12 mg h-1 m-2 from panels tested soon after manufacture. After five years of storage of the particleboard panels in ventilated conditions, the formaldehyde emission rates were measured as being between 0.1 and 1.1 mg h-1 m-2. It was apparent that formaldehyde emissions from particleboard bonded with a urea-formaldehyde resin with a urea to formaldehyde molar ratio of 1 to 1.5, reached a basal level approximately 12 months from the time of manufacture. The formaldehyde emitted over the initial 12 month period was equated to the formaldehyde which was originally present dissolved in the resin solution and the formaldehyde which was cleaved from the urea-formaldehyde polymer network during high temperature pressing. Formaldehyde lost from the particleboard after the initial 12 month storage phase was probably due to hydrolysis of the resin under ambient conditions. The latter was termed "evaporable" formaldehyde as opposed to "free" formaldehyde which was emitted in the first 12 month period. The fluctuations in the basal emission rates of formaldehyde from particleboard were attributed to changes in the microclimate associated with the particleboard. Particleboard panels with a higher density surface layer of wood tended to have higher formaldehyde emission rates in the early period of storage compared with particleboard having a lower density of wood in the surface layer. Emissions of formaldehyde from the edges of freshly sawn particleboard tended to be as much as 30 to 60 times greater than emissions from the faces of the original panels. After extended storage, emissions from the edges of particleboard tended to approximate the levels of emissions from the faces of particleboard. It was demonstrated that the presence of an air boundary layer adjacent to the particleboard surface has a significant effect on the formaldehyde emission rate from the panel surface. Below air speeds of 5 cm s-1 over the panel surface, it appeared that the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde through the air boundary layer controlled the rate of diffusion of formaldehyde from the particleboard surface into the bulk air. At air velocities in excess of 5 am s-1 the effect of the air boundary layer diminished. It was estimated that within enclosed spaces, such as houses with a relatively low air-turnover rate, the diffusive resistance of air boundary layers to formaldehyde emissions from particleboard surfaces could be significant in lowering the formaldehyde levels inside the house. The use of paints, paint-coated wallpaper and polymer-coated wallpaper to cover particleboard surfaces tended to reduce the emission rate of formaldehyde to below the detection threshold of the method of measurement (0.01 mg h-1 m-2). Some building materials other than urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard were shown to emit measureable quantities of formaldehyde. These materials were of cellulosic-origin and emitted as much as 0.3 mg of formaldehyde h-1 m-2. The latter were known to not contain urea-fonnal6ehyde bonding agents. The levels of formaldehyde inside a showhome containing urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard as wall and floor cladding were measured as ranging from 1.2 to 7.2 mg m-3, but these air-borne concentrations of formaldehyde decreased to between 0.7 and 1.3 mg m-3. after an interval of three months. A mathematical model was derived for the prediction of the maximum expected steady state levels of formaldehyde inside dwellings containing formaldehyde-emitting materials. The model took into account such parameters as: the emission rate of formaldehyde from the emitting surface; the surface area of the exposed emitting material; and the volumetric air flow rate through the dwelling. The model in general tended to indicate higher formaldehyde levels when tested using the parameters derived from measurements taken in the showhome. This model could conceivably find use in the design of buildings in order to minimize the levels of formaldehyde in the indoor environment. The lack of sufficient information in the literature relating to the mass transfer of formaldehyde through polymers prompted the investigation into the permeability characteristics of polymeric materials to formaldehyde. The steady state transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polymer films, such as plastic films, free paint and free polyurethane varnish coatings, were measured using a diffusion cell operated at atmospheric pressure. The mass diffusion principle associated with this permeation testing device best paralleled the real-life situation where either polymer films (plastic films) or polymer coatings (paint or varnish coatings) may be in contact with formaldehyde and water vapour, at atmospheric pressure. As a source of penetrant in these studies a dilute aqueous solution of formaldehyde was used to yield molecular formaldehyde. It was calculated that an aqueous solution containing 69 mg L-1 of formaldehyde gave rise to a concentration in air of formaldehyde, above the solution, of 1 mg m-3 at 30&#176;C. A solution with such a concentration of dissolved formaldehyde was chosen arbitrarily for permeation studies. Levels of air-borne formaldehyde inside enclosed airspaces such as in houses lined with urea-formaldehyde bonded particleboard, with a low air turn-over, could reasonably be expected to be in the region of 0.1 to 100 mg m-3. The use of carbon-14 formaldehyde was favoured in this research over the use of carbon-12 formaldehyde. This gave rise to the possibility of permeability isotope effects. Based on the information presented in this thesis and on the experimental variability in test results, it appeared that the effects of a permeability isotope effect were negligible in comparison. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the following types of polymer films were measured: low density polyethylene; high density polyethylene; high density-low density polyethylene blended polymer; polypropylene; poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); poly(viny1idene dichloride)-coated Poly(ethy1ene terephthalate); "Paraform", a multi-layered food packaging polymer film based on cellophane; Poly(ethylene vinyl acetate), a multi-layered food packaging polymer film; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; nylon-6; and cellophane. At 30&#176;C transmission rates of formaldehyde ranged from 1.2 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for cellophane to 1.2 x 10-l2 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 for poly (ethylene vinyl acetate) polymer films, respectively. There was some indication that the transmission rate of formaldehyde through low density polyethylene decreased with increasing film thickness. It also appeared that an increase in the water contents of nylon-6 and cellophane films lead to an increase in the transmission rate of formaldehyde. With the exception of the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of polymer films and the polystyrene film, all other polymer film types exhibited typical Fickian behaviour, in that the permeation of formaldehyde through each polymer film was steady state. The permeation of formaldehyde through poly (ethylene terephtha1ate)-type films and polystyrene film appeared to be anomalous in that the mass transfer process did not appear to show Fickian-type behaviour. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films, free vinyl-based paint films and through free polyurethane varnish films, were measured at 30&#176;C. The permeation of formaldehyde through free alkyd-type paint films and free polyurethane varnish films typified Fickian behaviour, in that after a short time-lag the steady state permeation of formaldehyde occurred. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through the free alkyd-types of paint film ranged from 1.8 x 10-9 &#956;g cm-1s-1 to 3 2 x l0-9 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 whereas transmission rates of formaldehyde through free polyurethane varnish films ranged from 4.1 x 10-10 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 2.4 x 10-8 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. It appeared that the "two-pack" or "catalytic-curing" type of polyurethane varnish film had a lower permeability to formaldehyde compared with either "one-pack" ("air-curing") or "one-pack" ("moisture-curing") varieties of polyurethane varnish. By contrast the transmission rates of formaldehyde through the vinyl-based types of paint films tended to range from 3.7 x 10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1 to 6.2 x10-7 &#956;g cm-1 s-1. A study of the temperature dependency of the permeation of formaldehyde through the following polymer film types was made: low density polyethylene; plasticised poly(vinyl chloride); polystyrene; polypropylene; high density polyethylene; cellophane; and nylon-6. The transmission rates of formaldehyde through each of these polymer film types increased with increasing temperature, over the temperature range of 30&#176;C to 50&#176;C, thus typifying Arrhenius behaviour. The energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde were calculated as ranging from 16 1 kcal mol-1 (67.4 kJ mol-1) for plasticised poly (vinyl chloride) to 33.1 kcal mol-1 (139 kJ mol-1 for cellophane, respectively. These activation energies were in general higher than the energies of activation for the permeation of other penetrants of similar molecular weight, through the same polymer types. The observed energies of activation for the permeation of formaldehyde through polymers were indicative of a strong interaction between formaldehyde and the various polymers. Desorption studies of formaldehyde from polymer films tested after permeability measurement, indicated that formaldehyde was irreversibly sorbed either onto or into the following polymer film types: low density polyethylene; poly(ethy1ene vinyl acetate); polypropylene; polystyrene; and plasticised poly(vinyl chloride). Formaldehyde was found to desorb from nylon-6 and cellophane polymer film types, indicating a different type of interaction between formaldehyde and these two polymer film types. The autoradiography of polymer films and free polymer coatings following permeability testing showed that the pattern of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde exhibited by each polymer film type or free polymer coating type, differed according to the type of polymer. Clustering of sorbed carbon-14 formaldehyde in polymer films containing polyethylene polymers may have been indicative of the formation of formaldehyde-formaldehyde polymers or perhaps could have been due to preferred pathways or sites for the diffusion of formaldehyde through the polymer film. The following types of polymer film tended to show a uniform sorption pattern of formaldehyde: nylon-6; cellophane; "Paraform"; free alkyd paint films; free vinyl-based paint films; and free polyurethane varnish films. The uniform appearance of the sorption pattern of carbon-14 formaldehyde may have been indicative of a higher solubility coefficient of permeation for formaldehyde in the latter polymer types. On the other hand, insufficient carbon-14 formaldehyde was sorbed by the poly(ethylene terephthalatel-type and polystyrene films in order to obtain autoradiographs. Both the poly(ethylene terephthalate)-types of films and the polystyrene film had a relatively low permeability to formaldehyde and appeared to also have a low solubilizing effect on formaldehyde. The data presented in this thesis are discussed in relation to the practical problem that initiated the study. Sufficient detailed information has been collected to enable informed decisions to be taken over the choice of formaldehyde-emitting materials used in the building and the food packaging industries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1984.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Independens long Vanuatu: the churches and politics in a Melanesian nation</field><field name="creator">Myers, Michael David</field><field name="description">In this dissertation I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in Vanuatu, focusing in particular on the role of the Christian churches in the independence movement of the 1970s.

In Chapter I, I introduce and defend my national, institutional perspective on the churches. In Chapter II, I discuss the history of Vanuatu, focusing specifically on the history of the missions up to the end of the 1960s. Chapter III looks at the independence movement and recent political history. In Chapter IV I examine the relationship between the churches and politics in two contrasting rural areas: at the Catholic mission station of Walarano, Malakula, and at the Presbyterian area of White Sands, Tanna. Chapter V is concerned with the ecumenical movement in the Pacific and looks at the support of the Pacific churches for the independence movement in Vanuatu. Chapters VI to X are parallel histories of the same period. They all look at the involvement of the churches in Vanuatu politics from about the beginning of the 1970s - when the independence movement began - up to national independence on 30 July 1980. However, each chapter is written from a different perspective. Chapter VI documents the political involvement of the Presbyterian Church; Chapter VII is concerned with Bishop Raweliffe and the politics of Anglicanism; Chapter VIII looks at the political role of the Roman Catholic Church in Vanuatu; Chapter IX focuses mostly on the relationship between the Churches of Christ and Nagriamel; and Chapter X takes a look at the ecumenical movement in Vanuatu and the origins and development of the New Hebrides Christian Council. In Chapter XI I examine the post-independence developments in all the major churches. Chapter XII concludes with a discussion of three issues: localisation, independence and unity, both in the churches and in the nation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::430000 History and Archaeology::430100 Historical Studies::430103 History: Pacific</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1984.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">PulA, a thermostable pullulanase from an extreme thermophile Caldocellum saccharolyticum</field><field name="creator">Albertson, Gregory David</field><field name="description">The pullulanase gene from Caldocellum saccharolyticum, an obligate thermophilic anaerobe, was sequenced and expressed in E. coli.

Periodic acid-Schiffs staining showed that this enzyme was glycosylated and substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but hydrolysed amylopectin, amylose and &#946;-limit dextran to produce a number of smaller oligosaccharides. The enzyme was expressed in E. coli from its own promoters and was purified from the cytoplasmic fraction. Substrate characterisation revealed that the enzyme debranched pullulan to produce only maltotriose, but had only limited activity on &#946;-limit dextran and amylopectin, and no activity on amylose. The pullulanase gene was also expressed under the control of a heat-inducible overexpression system in E. coli and a copper-inducible expression system in yeast. Amino acid homology comparisons of the pullulanase to other pullulanase sequences and related enzymes revealed a high degree of homology, particularly around three highly conserved regions. In &#945;-amylases amino acids in these regions are involved in catalytic activity, substrate binding and metal ion binding.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cellular and Molecular Biology)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Social Credit, an analysis of New Zealand&#8217;s perennial third party</field><field name="creator">Miller, Raymond, 1953-</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to provide a history and political analysis of the organisation, policies, membership and leadership of the Social Credit party between 1953 and 1986. The introductory chapter describes the methodology and reviews the literature on third parties in general and Social Credit in particular. Chapter Two provides a prelude to the formation of the Social Credit Political League in 1953. It traces the movement's decline as an education and pressure group under the first Labour Government. Chapter Three examines the debate surrounding the decision t o engage in direct political action and describes the process by which the Political League was formed. Chapter Four considers the reasons for and the findings of the Royal Commission on Monetary, Banking and Credit Systems (1956) and accounts for the growing internal debate culminating in the removal of Mr Wilfrid Owen as Leader in 1959. In Chapter Five the impact on the party of Mr Vernon Cracknell's victory in Hobson in 1966 is considered, along with an assessment of his role in Parliament as the sole third party representative. The reasons for his defeat at the 1969 general election and replacement as Leader some six months later are investigated, and Chapter Six is devoted to the brief but stormy experiment with Mr John O'Brien as Leader, followed by his split from the League in 1972 and the formation of the New Democrat Party. The early Beetham years, including attempts to revise the party's monetary reform dogma, broaden the scope of its message, and to give it a more professional organisation are considered in Chapter Seven. I n Chapter Eight the reasons for and the internal consequences of the party's rapid rise in popularity from early 1978 and its decline after March 1981 are analysed. The chapter ends with an account of Mr Beetham's defeat as Leader in 1986. The thesis concludes that Social Credit's history as an electoral organisation has been conspicuously cyclical, that its progress has been regulated largely by the electoral performances of the two major parties and by the presence or absence of minor party competition, that its leadership has been distinctly oligarchic, and that Social Credit has not been one, but several different parties. Why has the party not been more successful? And why has it lasted so long? These questions are addressed in the final chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Political Studies)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2437</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitating independent learning early in the first year of school</field><field name="creator">Watson, Barbara</field><field name="description">This is a study of a) the nature and incidence of independent learning defined as "knowing how to generate and direct the processes of learning...*(see p.3) in new entrant classroom settings and, b) the nature of the teacher-child interactions associated with such independent learning. Systematic observation was used at school entry and three months later, to identify aspects of independent learning and the associated teacher behaviours. Six categories of child directed acts identified the range of behaviours from which independent learning could be inferred. Each category of teacher behaviour that appeared to facilitate independent learning in children was developed as a "mirror image" of each category of child directed acts. The teacher and four children in two new entrant classes were observed over the whole day for five days during two observation periods, one at the beginning of Term three and the other after 12 weeks. Each class was involved in normal classroom activities that covered the whole curriculum. The children were engaging in a considerable amount of independent learning on entry to school and three months later. Many facilitative teaching acts occurred in the interactive style that was demonstrated in all aspects of the curriculum. The teachers spent a considerable portion of teaching time assisting children in one-to-one teaching situations and in small groups, encouraging their responses and fostering and supporting independence in their learning. There was some difference observed between teachers in the attention given to different categories and in the facilitative behaviour occurring in one-to-one interactions and small group teaching interactions. A way of teaching emerges that differs from a teaching agenda determined by didactic, traditional instruction. The two teachers were deemed to be using the children's agenda to foster and support them in independent learning in the various curriculum areas. Some of the practical and philosophical features of the New Zealand education system that may contribute to this particular style of teaching are discussed. The theories of learning and teaching deriving from this study place a value on independent learning (as here defined) in new entrant children and on the teacher&#8217;s role in providing opportunities for it to develop. Independent learning a) ensures the continuation of learning at times when the teacher is directly engaged with other children, and b) derives from a teacher expectation that children will be able to actively process ideas and make some decisions about their learning. It engenders a power in children that sustains the momentum of learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2438</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecology of the New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Skuse) (Diptera : Lycetophilidae) in tourist caves at Waitomo</field><field name="creator">Pugsley, Chris, 1953-</field><field name="description">The New Zealand glowworm Arachnocampa luminosa (Diptera: Mycetophilidae) provides the national tourist industry with a unique attraction. The Glowworm Cave at Waitomo has an international reputation for the bioluminescent display produced by A. luminosa. The aim of the present study was to investigate glowworm ecology in the tourist caves at Waitomo, the results to provide factual information so that scientifically sound management procedures could be devised to ensure the long term survival of the population. The literature on all aspects of A. luminosa is reviewed. A continuous cycle of development occurs with most stages present throughout the year. However, the majority of the larval population pupates in late winter/early spring, producing a new generation in spring/early summer. There are five larval instars; the time for individual development in the Glowworm Cave varies considerably but is estimated to take 5 months on average. Distribution of glowworms is dependent on an adequate food supply, cool, moist climate and a suitable horizontal rock surface. Their diet consists of chironomids with some tipulids, ephemeropterans and trichopterans, most of which emerge inside the cave. Factors likely to influence distribution and productivity of benthic fauna in the cave are reviewed, including the importance of flooding and stream drift fauna in restocking the cave. Mortality is caused by two species of opiliones, cannibalism and a fungal pathogen identified as Tolypocladium sp. (Moniliales). Preliminary experiments with Tolypocladium indicate that the higher temperatures of the Glowworm Cave may be responsible for the prevalence of the fungus compared with non-tourist caves in the district. Observations on cave climate showed that the Glowworm Cave now has a higher range of temperature and relative humidity compared with earlier records and non-tourist caves at Waitomo. This is attributed in part to the free flow of air that occurs between the two entrances of the cave and the outside atmosphere. Reasons for the decline in the glowworm display that has occurred in the past few years are discussed. The installation of an open grille on the Top Entrance of the Glowworm Cave in 1975 is suggested as one of the main factors responsible. Future research projects are mentioned, together with recommendations for cave management related to glowworm ecology.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The utilisation of cyclopropyl compounds in the synthesis of troponoids</field><field name="creator">Gravatt, Gary Lance</field><field name="description">The fully regio-controlled synthesis of C1a-C12a mono-seco colchicine 133, as well as a number of structurally interesting analogues, has been achieved. The key feature employed in our approach to troponoid compounds of this type has been the incorporation of synthetic equivalents for &#945;-tropolone anions 84 and 87 via dehydrobrominative ring expansion of C7-substituted7-bromobicyclo[4.1.0]heptan-2,3- and -3,4-diones respectively. The hydroxyl functionality present in tropolone 143 has been found to be a suitable progenitor for the C7-acetamido group in mono-seco colchicine 133. Studies directed towards the enantio-controlled introduction of the C7-acetamide moiety via asymmetric reduction of the prochiral ketone 152 are discussed. Various strategies to effect B-ring closure in mono-seco colchicine 133 and its congeners are presented. The novel preparation and dehydrogenative dimerisation of desacetamido mono-seco colchicine 174 is reported. An efficient synthesis of the naturally occurring tropone nezukone (16) has been accomplished via the novel rearrangement of bicyclic methylene cyclopropane 209.

Chromosome numbers for the following taxa are confirmed: P. kumeraho A. Cunn. 2n = 24, P. aspera Sieber (cultivated) 2n = 24, P. phylici-folia Lodd. 2n = 48, P. rugosa Cheeseman 2n = 48, P. erici-folia Hook. 2n = 36, P. hamiltonii L.B. Moore 2n = 36, P. edgerleyi Hook. 2n = 37, P. novae-zelandiae stat.nov. 2n = 36. In P. kumeraho, breeding experiments, and studies of the ovule show that plants are self fertile, and reproduction is sexual. Microsporogenesis studies show some asyndesis, and the presence of fragments of unexplained origin at meiosis. Half the microspores formed are inviable. The triploid taxa reproduce by agamospermy. The origin of the embryo sac is diplosporous. Although breeding experiments indicate that pollination improves seed set, endosperm chromosome counts in P. hamiltonii show that fertilisation of the endosperm nucleus does not occur. A physiological stimulatory effect from pollination is postulated. At microsporogenesis in the triploid taxa, some restitution occurs at the first meiotic division with the formation of large unreduced pollen grains. The rate of restitution is variable and is affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Restitution is correlated with high univalent frequency, and restituting cells exhibit little Anaphase I movement of chromosomes. Pollen of triploids is highly variable in size, pore number, and viability. P. phylicifolia shows mostly bivalents at meiosis, producing 25-30% viable pollen with reduced chromosome number. Reproduction is mainly sexual, but there is some indication that agamospermy may also occur. P. rugosa shows a high proportion of multivalents at meiosis, and segregation is irregular. Viable pollen with a reduced chromosome number is below 5%. Restitution may occur at meiosis under certain conditions. Reproduction is presumed to be agamospermous. The comparative morphology of the New Zealand and Australian taxa of Pomaderris was also studied from herbarium specimens. The data were analysed using numerical taxonomic methods. Four clusters of O.T.U.s are identified, but many O.T.U.s are intermediate in morphology and do not belong to a cluster. The New Zealand taxa are spread among the four clusters. Each N.Z. taxon is closer to an Australian taxon than to other N.Z. taxa. Pollen of Australian specimens was compared with pollen of known N.Z. polyploids. The existence of polyploids and apomicts among the Australian taxa is suggested. Taxonomy and origin of the New Zealand polyploid taxa are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2441</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Labour mobility and economic transformation in Solomon Islands: lusim Choiseul, bae kam baek moa?</field><field name="creator">Friesen, Wardlow.</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship of labour mobility and socioeconomic transformation in the Solomon Islands, and proposes that one cannot be understood in isolation from the other. Explanation is pursued both at the levels of structure and of agency, and integration of these levels is attempted in some places. This is discussed in the first part of the thesis, within a general discussion of issues of theory and method. The second part of the thesis deals with the structural parameters of labour mobility. Through the twentieth century, the institutions of government, mission and capitalist enterprise have been central in shaping the Solomon Islands social formation. The roles of these formal institutions with implications for labour mobility have ranged from purveyors of ideology to employers of labour. Another major element in the social formation is an original Melanesian mode of production which influences labour mobility through village-level institutions such as the land tenure system, kinship, and household operation. Labour circulation is a major factor in linking village and non-village institutions, and more abstractly in articulating two different modes of production. The third part of the thesis considers the ways in which individual agency operates within structure. The data base are life histories and related information from the Mbambatana language group on the island of Choiseul. This is integrated with national, regional and village-level structural information. Education is important in the way it 'selects' individuals for certain kinds of employment. This selection process occurs within the wage economy generally, but is further refined within institutions of employment. This results in labour mobility 'streams' which have identifiable characteristics related to gender, education, and employment type. Movements within each 'stream' have typical temporal and spatial characteristics. Patterns of labour mobility, especially sequence, are affected by gender and life cycle factors. For men and women the most critical changes take place in the 20s age span, but individual behaviour varies according to marriage and childrearing patterns. From a village perspective, labour circulation is a logical response to the necessity of operating within two different economic systems typified by different modes of production. This process of articulation is manifest in other ways as well, and households or families may adopt different strategies in operating within two different systems. The particular strategy adopted depends on the labour power available, degree of access to land, and employment possibilities of individual members.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370400 Human Geography::370402 Social and cultural geography</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland,1986.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure of reovirus</field><field name="creator">Metcalf, Peter</field><field name="description">The arrangement of the capsomers comprising the outer shell or capsid of reovirus has been determined by the computer modeling of images of reovirus replicas prepared by freeze-etching techniques. An optical low-pass spatial filter was used to improve the visibility of the virus images and two types of capsid subunit could then be seen which were termed ring and pentamer-crater capsomers. Sufficient of them could be identified on reovirus particles to make the computer modeling of the particle possible. The capsid was shown by these methods to have T=13,1 triangulated icosahedral symmetry. It is comprised of 60 ring capsomers and 12 pentamer craters surrounded by another 60 incomplete ring capsomers. The same T=13,1 symmetry was found for the single-shelled particles of the two rotaviruses, SA-11 and NCDV, which have 132 uniform capsomers. However, fragments of reovirus capsids, such as are sometimes seen in negatively stained reovirus preparations, were found which had non-T=13,1 symmetry, presumably as a result of capsomer rearrangement. The dimensions of a large number of the triangular subunits of these capsid fragments were measured and it was shown that triangles originating from different parts of the reovirus capsid had non-identical lengths. The lengths found were consistent with the T=13,1 model proposed for the virus. Conditions favouring the formation of crystalline aggregates of reovirus core particles have been found. The unit cell geometry of the two classes of crystals obtained was determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cell Biology)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A structural investigation of some light atom molecules</field><field name="creator">Buckleton, John</field><field name="description">A series of structures of light atom molecules is presented.

It is therefore important to gain an understanding of the reactivity of these functional groups. The metal-carbon double bond is introduced in Chapter 1 with a literature review and the following two chapters are concerned with the synthesis and properties of a new class of Group VIII metal carbene complexes containing the prototype carbene ligand, =CH2. The synthetic route to the first of these complexes involves a new low-valent osmium complex OsCl(NO) (PPh3)3. The synthesis of this complex from a reformulated complex containing the novel peroxycarbonyl ligand is discussed in Chapter 2, followed by simple reactions including the synthesis of a range of acetylene, allene and heteroallene &#960;-adducts. The reactions establish that OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 reacts as the osmium analogue of IrCl(CO)(PPh3)2. The methylene-ligand synthesis involves the addition of diazomethane to OsCl(NO)(PPh3)3 to give the structurally characterised Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. The reaction has been extended to give the first isolable ruthenium and iridium methylene complexes. The reactions of these complexes establish the nucleophilicity of the double bond and two Lewis acid adducts, Os(CH2AuI)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2 and [Os(CH2S(O)O)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2]ClO4, have been structurally characterised. The reaction with CO and isocyanides to form ketene and ketenimine ligands illustrates a different mode of reaction that is interpreted in terms of the non-innocent participation of the nitrosyl ligand. The change from nucleophilicity to electrophilicity of the double bond with a reduction of metal electron density is illustrated by reactions of Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(pph3)2 which implicate [OS(CH2)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2]+ as an intermediate. Os(CH2Cl)Cl2(NO)(PPh3)2 is formed by addition of Cl2 to Os(CH2)Cl(NO)(PPh3)2. In Chapter 4 a different type of metal-carbon double bond is discussed. The complexes contain the relatively uncommon dichlorocarbene ligand and the synthesis of the first such iridium complex, Ir(CCl2)Cl3(PPh3)2 is described. The utility of the dichlorocarbene ligand in the synthesis of a range of carbene ligands including monochlorocarbene complexes is illustrated. The most useful single reaction of the dichlorocarbene complexes is that forming a metal-carbon triple bond. A review of the literature concerning carbyne complexes is presented in Chapter 5 and the synthesis and reactions of a number of carbyne complexes is discussed in Chapter 6. Like the methylene complexes, the carbyne complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 contain nucleophilic metal-carbon bonds and Os(CHPh)Cl2(CO)(PPh3)2 resulting from HCl addition has been structurally characterised. However, just as the reactivity can be changed with the methylene complexes, the reduction of metal electron density in complexes such as [Os(CR)Cl2 (CNR')(PPh3)2]ClO4 (R = C6H4-4-NMe2, R' = C6H4-4-Me) makes the triple bond electrophilic. Two methods for synthesising these octahedral carbyne complexes are described. One, involving a reaction of complexes such as Os(CPh)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with oxygen and the formation of another peroxycarbonyl ligand, the other a reaction with iodine to give complexes such as Ru(CPh)ClI2(PPh3)2. Reactions with chlorine by contrast lead to a group of reactive chlorophenyl carbene complexes. Where appropriate, the reactivity of the complexes described is interpreted in terms of frontier-orbital and charge controlled reactions using the current models for the carbene and carbyne complexes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1983.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The calculation of cloud parameters from AVHRR data</field><field name="creator">Grainger, Roy Gordon</field><field name="description">This thesis deals with the electromagnetic radiation that is reflected from and emitted by a clear or cloudy terrestrial atmosphere. Calculations are performed in order to estimate the radiation exitant to space in the visible, the near visible, and the two infrared windows at approximately 4 &#956;m and 11 &#956;m. The NOAA-9 satellite Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR/2) is used as the data acquisition system. The satellite AVHRR system is described, as well as future TIROSN satellites. The pre-launch calibration of the radiometer is described in some detail. Post-launch calibration is examined using a reflectance difference method. The radiometer gains are shown to have changed by more than 20% from their pre-launch values. A LOWTRAN based atmospheric model suitable for New Zealand is developed to provide cloud free transmission values. Atmospheric scattering is shown to contribute negligibly to visible cloud measurements (for 8-bit radiometer resolution). The Channels 1 to 3 terrestrial reflectance is averaged from more than two years of satellite data. Sea-surface state is examined as a function of windspeed. A method of extracting surface temperature in rugged terrain is developed. Dual temperature measurements at 10.8 and 11.8 &#956;m are used to estimate surface air temperature. The transfer of radiation in a single layer cloud is calculated as a function of cloud thickness, observation/illumination geometry and the effective radius of the cloud drop-distribution. The variation in drop-size is contained in an ensemble of modified-Gamma distributions whose effective radius varies from 1 to 30 &#956;m with a fixed dispersion of 0.25. A technique is established which allows effective cloud radius to be estimated from 3.7 &#956;m AVHRR/2 imagery. The radiation values at 0.65 &#956;m and 11.8 &#956;m are used to correct the 3.7 &#956;m reflectance for variation in cloud thickness and temperature respectively. The procedure is limited to warm clouds of moderate optical depth. In addition, the inversion process generates values of cloud top height and temperature, cloud depth and column liquid water content. The method is used to observe the development of orographic cloud formed over the southern half of the North Island of New Zealand. The inversion results for this type of cloud are in agreement with aircraft measurements carried out by the New Zealand Meteorological Service and are well fitted by a simple drop-growth model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of the magellanic clouds and other southern objects at TeV energies</field><field name="creator">Bond, Ian Anthony</field><field name="description">The results of observational studies of very high energy (VHE) and ultra high energy (UHE) gamma ray emission, by various astrophysical objects, made from 1988 to 1990 with the JANZOS Cerenkov facility are presented. The active galaxy Cen A and the Galactic X-ray binary systems Vela X-1, Cen X-3, and Cir X-1 were monitored for VHE gamma ray emission above 1 TeV. No evidence was found for persistent or episodic emission from any of these objects. Upper limits on the VHE fluxes above 1 TeV of 2.1&#215;10-11, 2.7&#215;10-11, 3.6&#215;10-11 and 3.5&#215;10-11 cm-2 s-1 respectively were obtained for these objects. These limits are consistent with previous observations made by other groups. Various objects in the Magellanic Clouds were monitored for UHE gamma ray emission using the Cerenkov technique at large zenith angles. This technique has been found to be more sensitive at UHE energies -100 TeV than the conventional air shower technique. During 1990 the equipment was modified to allow a sky coverage of 7&#176;&#215;23&#176; at large zenith angles. This enabled most of the extent of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be surveyed at UHE energies. An examination of the UHE database yielded no evidence for persistent emission from SN1987A and selected X-ray pulsars in the Magellanic Clouds. Upper limits on the UHE fluxes (in cm-2s-1) above the given threshold energies were obtained as follows: SMC X-1, 2.4&#215;10-13 (&gt;30 TeV); SN1987A, 2.3&#215;10-13 (&gt;65 TeV); PSR0540-693, 2.3&#215;10-13(&gt;65 TeV); LMC Trans, 1.5&#215;10-13(&gt;130 TeV); LMC X-4, 1.3&#215;l0-l3 (&gt;140 TeV). Evidence was found for two episodes of pulsed gamma ray emission above 65 TeV from SN1987A. On the nights of May 28 and June 23, 1990, a periodicity search using the Rayleigh test showed significant power at 18.356 ms. This is near a periodicity reported at optical wavelengths in September, 1990. The chance probability for the individual period was about 10-6 on each of the two nights. Excess events of the order of 1&#963; were also seen on these nights. The overall chance probability, allowing for all degrees of freedom, was found to be 0.1%. Evidence was also found for a single episode of gamma ray emission above 140 TeV from LMC X-4 on May 27, 1990. Excess events were seen with a statistical significance of 2.4 &#963;. A periodicity test showed maximum Rayleigh power at 13.488 s on this night. The chance probability for the individual period was 8&#215;10-3 and the overall chance probability was found to be 0.5%.

The South Sepik blueschists, or Tau Blueschist, are situated near the centre of New Guinea, on the northern fall of the island's axial mountains, and are mostly contained in an allochthonous east-west lens (55 x 8 km) known as the Tau body. There are also some much smaller allochthons to the east of the Tau body. The blueschists occur within the late-Mesozoic to Eocene Salumei Formation, which is believed to be a tectonic mixture of mostly politic sediments, derived from the continent to the south, and ophiolite fragments and other volcanogenic rocks, related to the arc to the north. Near the Tau body, the Salumei Formation is metamorphosed from prehnite-pumpellyite to low-greenschist grade. Stratigraphic constraints and isotopic dating indicate an Oligocene to early Miocene metamorphism of the Tau Blueschist, Salumei Formation, and other metamorphic rocks in the region. The blueschists are mostly massive to well-foliated mafic schists, containing abundant blue amphibole, but there are also some intimately associated pelitic-calcareous-graphitic metasediments. Within the Tau body the metamorphic grade increases towards the north, from lawsonite rocks to high-grade epidote blueschists. The lowest grade blueschists are pumpellyitic lawsonitic metabasites, known only from river float. In addition, there are zones and isolated occurrences of coarsely crystalline mafic tectonic blocks, within and just north of the Tau body. These include high-grade blueschist, eclogite and amphibolite. There is a complete spectrum from blueschist to eclogite. Whole-rock chemistry indicates, that all basic rocks are probably metamorphosed mafic ophiolite. The mineralogy and mineral chemistry is similar to other circum-Pacific blueschists, particularly those in New Caledonia. The blue amphibole is glaucophane or crossite, but ferroglaucophane occurs in the lawsonite zone. It is sometimes accompanied by Ca-amphibole, ranging from actinolite, in the lawsonite zone, to barroisite, in the epidote zone. Some metabasites and metasediments contain grossularitic almandine garnet, spessartine rich at low grade to pyropic at high grade. Sodic pyroxene is not particularly common in the blueschists, and is generally an acmitic variety, although omphacite occurs in eclogites. Paragonite is common in the epidote zone, often associated with phengite, while chlorite and albite are present at all grades, generally in small amounts. Calcite, dolomite and chloritoid occur in metasediments of the epidote zone. The unique assemblage lawsonite-glaucophane-chloritoid was found. Apart from zoning in minerals, and minor retrograde alteration, most rocks appear to be equilibrium assemblages, and obey the phase rule. The conditions of metamorphism are estimated from available experimental studies, and calculations based on mineral thermodynamic data. Equilibria involving lawsonite, epidote, grossular, albite, paragonite and quartz suggest 395&#176;C and 7.5 kbar at the disappearance of lawsonite. Metasediments in the middle of the epidote zone yield a minimum of 420&#176;C from the calcite-dolomite geothermometer, and 444&#176; &#177; 20&#176;C from coexistence of chloritoid, garnet, albite paragonite and quartz. A pressure of 10-11 kbar at 500&#176;C is calculated from garnet, epidote, albite, paragonite and quartz in the highest grade blueschists. Corrections to the muscovite-paragonite solvus for pressure and non-binary components give plausible temperatures and pressures for coexisting white micas. Mineral stabilities, and equilibria between paragonite, jadeite, albite, grossular and zoisite, indicate a maximum of 550&#176;C and 15 kbar for eclogites, and that current versions of the garnet-clinopyroxene thermometer are not giving accurate results in eclogites with high jadeite or acmite in the pyroxene. From buffer equilibria between calcite and Ca-Al silicates in metasediments, the non-ideal mole fraction of CO2 is estimated to be about 0.02 in the epidote zone, and 0.002 in the lawsonite zone. Graphite, pyrite and pyrrhotite in metasediments allow calculation of fluid composition in the system C-H-O-S, and show that very minor CH and H2S were present. Water activities may have been high in some eclogites. The metamorphic conditions require that both blueschists and eclogites were formed in a subduction system, and support the continent-arc collision hypothesis. However, some form of active and rapid transport is needed to bring these rocks back to shallow levels, and the term "retrojection" is coined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260100 Geology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The structure and function of invertebrate septate junctions</field><field name="creator">Green, Colin Richard</field><field name="description">The structure and function of septate junctions have been studied by ultrastructural techniques in a wide range of invertebrate phyla. Techniques have included conventional and tracer impregnated tissue thin sectioning, and freeze-fracture of both fixed and unfixed tissue. Standard and goniometer stage transmission electron microscopy has been used. Work in this study has been concentrated mainly on the lower invertebrate phyla in which the simplest forms of junction might be seen, and on the higher invertebrate phyla. This latter group is of special interest in the transition region between the invertebrate and vertebrate phyla. Six new types of septate junction and a form of tight junction have been found in invertebrate phyla and are described. Two of these new septate junctions occur in each of the phyla Coelenterata, Echinodermata and Hemichordata. The tight junction occurs in the phylum Tunicata. Further data has also been obtained on five of the six previously described types of septate junction. The distribution of all twelve types within the invertebrates and their phylogenetic relationships are discussed. Work with the goniometer stage has aided in interpreting junctional structures. The results have revealed several features of the septate junction that support the idea that it has a mainly occluding function analogous to that of the vertebrate tight junction. In addition, an anastomosing septate junction has been found in the Echinodermata which is postulated to be a structural intermediate between the invertebrate septate junction and the vertebrate tight junction. A hypothesis is proposed suggesting how the septate junction might have evolved into the vertebrate tight junction. Tricellular junctional regions of most of the septate junction types are noted and briefly described.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unemployment in New Zealand, 1981-1983: a study of the presentation by radio, television and the press of a major social problem</field><field name="creator">Leitch, Shirley R.</field><field name="description">In New Zealand there is a marked scarcity of material on the workings of the indigenous news media.

From the original cloned hybridoma line, a number of variants have been isolated which grow as different types of tumours in syngeneic mice. One particular strain grows with high efficiency as tumours in the spleen. In contrast to the original hybridoma, the progressive spleen-seeking tumour cells appear to have lost their ability to stimulate the immune system.

Particles emitted from a steel mill were studied at their point of emission, during transport through the atmosphere and after deposition. The mill was located in a coastal region removed from other major industrial particle sources which made the identification of the mill particulate emissions possible in ambient samples. The mill utilizes indigenous titanomagnetite ironsand and coal as the raw materials. There is evidence of the surface enrichment of volatile trace elements such as Zn, S, Na, K and P from the raw materials in the particulate emissions. Particle samples were collected from sites within the mill which represented different stages in the iron-making process, including the rotary kilns, electric melting furnaces and the vanadium recovery plant. This established an inventory of particulate emissions. Mill sourced particles were then identified and studied in air samples collected downwind of the mill on silver-coated nucleopore filters. AES and SIMS depth profiling studies indicated the mill particles became surface enriched in sea salt components such as S, predominately as sulfate, Cl- and Na+ after atmospheric aging. This was attributed to their coagulation with the marine derived ambient aerosol. SIMS ion imaging and mass spectral analysis suggested a characteristic "fingerprint" of the mill emissions could be distinguished in the ambient aerosol up to 8 km downwind of the mill. An experimental rig was constructed to model the interaction between the mill particles and the natural marine aerosol. A bubble nebuliser was developed to produce an artificial sea salt aerosol which was reacted with a metal powder in the fluidised bed of the rig. The metal powder was then aged under controlled relative humidity (RH) conditions. It was shown that an iron powder, after reaction and aging at 75% RH, developed an aqueous surface layer which quickly led to electrochemical corrosion, dissolution and oxidation of the particle surface. Evidence of this corrosion of metal particles occurring in the environment was found in a SEM-EDX study of the mill particles deposited on pine needles downwind of the mill. It was argued that these reactions would increase the bio-availability of the particle components. A model which incorporated these observations was developed to describe the morphogenesis of atmospheric primary particles during aging in the New Zealand environment. XPS was used to study ambient aerosols deposited on both botanical and artificial passive sampling surfaces. Plant leaves were shown to be excellent collectors of particulate material and were suited to analysis by XPS. Site differences in the atmospheric aerosol load and composition were detected on vine leaves located on a hill side (high NaCl) and at a roadside (high sulfate and silicates) in a rural area. Zn and Fe species were detected by XPS on pine needles up to 2 km downwind of the steel mill.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1992.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2453</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forensic Applications of Bayesian Inference to Glass Evidence</field><field name="creator">Curran, James Michael</field><field name="description">The role of the scientist in the courtroom has come under more scrutiny this century than ever before.

The early stages in the formation of continuous anodic layers of bismuth oxide were studied using the technique of cyclic voltammetry. During this period, the oxide, Bi2O3, covered the surface by a process of simultaneous thickening and spreading of patches. The study of oxide nucleation classified the metal surface into two different areas with different kinetics of oxide nucleation. The ratio of the two areas varied according to the history and original preparation of the surface. Film nucleation was also studied by the galvanostatic step and potentiostatic step methods. The rate of spreading of the oxide patches over the surface was shown to be controlled by the magnitude of the surface area still uncovered. Film thickening was studied using both galvanostatic and cyclic voltammetric techniques. The high field growth law i = &#256; exp (B&#274;) where i is the current density and &#274; the field in the oxide layer, was found with parameters &#256; = (1 &#177; 0.5) x 10-5 A cm-2 B = (2.0 &#177; 0.5) x 10-6 cm V-1 This value of B gives an activation distance for high-field ion transport, a* = 0.2 nm, comparable to the radius of a lattice site. These parameters were determined for very thin films in strongly alkaline electrolyte (pH 13; thickness &lt;30 nm). At greater film thickness, cracking of the film gave a porous layer on top of a continuous barrier layer, and the apparent value of the parameter B increased to 1.7 x 10-5 cm v-1. All previous work on the bismuth anodic film thickening process has been affected to some extent by cracking of the film. In this work, cracking of the film was confirmed by microscopic observation, including scanning electron microscopy. Dissolution of the film, giving breakdown of the oxide layer and pitting of the metal, was an important phenomenon. It became particularly significant for pH &lt;8. The thickness attained by the anodic bismuth oxide layer was limited by this process to only 4 nm at pH 5, increasing to over 200 nm at pH 13. The cathodic reduction of the oxide proceeded from the outer surface inwards, and a rough, porous metal surface resulted. A model involving electron injection from the metal into the oxide, diffusion of electrons through the film and their reaction at the outer surface has been proposed. Microscopic observation confirmed the porous nature of the electro-reduced surface. The transient conductivity of the bismuth anodic film has been investigated, and the effects of standing at open-circuit in the electrolyte or of heating in air studied. The galvanostatic method was used. The observed effects could be adequately explained as being due to the presence ofanon-stoichiometric, n-type (excess metal) layer at the film-solution interface. Cyclic voltammetry was used to investigate the possibility of nucleation of anodic bismuth oxo-halides from solutions containing halide ions. Solutions containing fluoride, chloride, bromide or iodide at pH 4-9, phosphate and phosphate with added methanol at pH 8.5 were used. Consideration of thermodynamic stability would indicate the formation of new phases, but results showed that, in the comparatively short time scale of the experiments, kinetic factors resulted in the formation of anodic Bi2O3, except when the solution contained iodide at low pH, when the oxo-iodide, BiOI, was probably formed. Room lighting had no effect on the cyclic voltammetric or galvanostatic measurements. The transient response of anodic films on bismuth to an intense flash of white light was studied. In the case of a thick anodic oxide film (240 nm), the results were interpreted in terms of photo-excitation of the film, producing electron-hole pairs which were separated by the applied field. The recombination process was best described as rate-limiting thermal excitation of trapped electrons. The lifetime of an electron in the conduction band of anodic Bi2O3 was determined: &#964;c = 23 ms. The photo-response of a very thin anodic oxide film (4 nm) involved internal photo-emission of electrons from the metal into the oxide. Formation of a positive space charge by the injection of extra cations from the metal into the film followed. The transient photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) or photo-current (potentiostatic experiments) showed the decay of both excess electronic and ionic space charges. The density of electron traps in the anodic oxide film was determined as NT &gt; 3 x 1018 cm-3. When the anodic film was formed in a solution containing bromide or iodide at pH 5, an inversion of the sign of the primary photo-effect from that observed in the absence of additives (4 nm thick film) was seen, and interpreted in terms of the photo-excitation of halide ions incorporated in the film. The lifetime of a conduction electron in anodic BiOI was determined as 1.5 &#177; 0.2 ms, much less than in anodic Bi2O3 (23 ms). In all the studies of the photo-effect, Gauss' theorem was used to relate the observed photo-potential (galvanostatic experiments) to the photo-induced charge separation. An approximate value of the conduction electron mobility in anodic Bi2O3 was thus obtained: &#956; &#8771; 5 x 10-8 cm2 V-1 s-1. Parameters for the evolution of hydrogen on the bare bismuth metal surface, were obtained: b = 0.11 V, log10(i0/Acm-2) = -10.3 and (&#8706;(log10i0)/&#8706;(PH))&#951; = 0 where &#951; = E &#8211; 60 pH mV.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1974.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2460</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical studies of macromolecules</field><field name="creator">Wills, Peter Rowland</field><field name="description">Hydrodynamic theories of macromolecular structure have been critically examined and used in the experimental study of the conformation of various biological molecules. This work has been carried out giving careful consideration to ancient and modern wisdom. The fundamental molecular structure of liver glycogen has been investigated using a variety of biophysical techniques, including intensity fluctuation spectroscopy. It has been found that above a certain minimum size, molecules of this material are hydrodynamically equivalent to one another, and behave as if comprised of ideal spherical subunits. Smaller molecules do not have a smooth hydrodynamic surface and display a much higher degree of frictional interaction with the aqueous solvent. It has also been shown that when treated with disulphide-bond breaking reagents, large glycogen molecules are disrupted, but the structure of the subunits is undisturbed. The role of protein in glycogen structure has been confirmed by these studies. Intensity fluctuation spectroscopy has also been applied to the study of protein conformation. The frictional coefficients of bovine serum albumin monomers and dimers have been measured, and an apparent conformational change in the monomer detected upon the binding of salicylate. The unfolding and subsequent aggregation of lysozyme when it is thermally denatured have been observed and the hydrodynamic radii of the native, folded state and the expanded, unfolded state of protein have been measured.

Smith</field><field name="description">One of the traditional aims of the philosophy of science has been to formulate a methodology of science&#8212;that is, a normative theory of scientific method. The rules and standards of such a theory are intended to capture the central features of scientific rationality and to explain the sense in which scientific knowledge progressively grows. Although no particular methodology of science has won universal endorsement, it is generally agreed among philosophers that the broad aim of constructing one is both reasonable and worth pursuing in order to understand the nature of scientific growth. But this aim has also been attacked as fundamentally misconceived by some critics who maintain that no theory of method can do justice to actual science. The objections to the philosophical program of framing a methodology of science come mainly from three quarters. Firstly, there is Paul Feyerabend, according to whom the historical development of science reveals that no set of general normative rules and standards can be given for science. Most of the rules and standards hitherto proposed, he contends, have been violated by scientists and, moreover, were necessarily violated, owing to the incommensurability of revolutionary scientific theories. Secondly, there is Michael Polanyi, who claims that scientific rationality cannot be codified in the explicit rules and standards of any theory of method because much of scientific knowledge and practice is 'tacit' and reflects the personal, unspecifiable contributions of individual scientists. And thirdly, sociologists of scientific knowledge (in particular, those of the Strong Programme) assert that the nature and content of science should be explained in sociological terms rather than by reference to a methodology of science. However, it is argued here that the objections made by Feyerabend, Polanyi and the sociologists to the possibility of a theory of method do not stand up to critical examination. A large part of the anti-methodologists' case is based not only on an overly narrow view of the nature of a theory of method, but also on the mistaken belief that the traditional philosophical and epistemological approach to the investigation of scientific rationality should be replaced by a largely descriptive analysis of scientific practice. This belief is criticised on the grounds that a normative methodology must not be supposed to explain scientific practice, nor can views on the nature of scientific rationality be derived from descriptions of scientific practice. Finally, it is suggested that the positions of Feyerabend, Polanyi, and the Strong Programme have deep affinities with the 'practice-oriented' philosophy of the later Wittgenstein. This may, perhaps, explain why they abandon realist construals of scientific theories, of scientific standards, and of the notion of truth. Like Wittgenstein, they adopt a form of antirealism and conventionalism which leads, ultimately, to a relativist interpretation of scientific standards and knowledge. Coupled with the anti-methodologists' failure to defeat the possibility of a theory of method, this relativism demonstrates the poverty of an attack on method constructed on wittgensteinian lines.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Philosophy)--University of Auckland, 1984.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2463</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of serial correlation on linear models</field><field name="creator">Triggs, Christopher M.</field><field name="description">Given a linear regression model y = X&#946; + e, where e has a multivariate normal distribution N(0, &#931;) consequences of the erroneous assumption that e is distributed as N(0, I) are considered.

Tests fox the classroom measurement of two components were developed. The components were; PHIL(CC), the claiming of concern for other persons as an overriding, universal, and prescriptive principle in moral decision making; and; GIG, knowledge of factual information which is relevant in making moral decisions which subjects face. The test development exercise was undertaken at a time when public interest in moral education was growing. The recent demand for moral education in Auckland is reviewed. Over the last fifteen years, since the Currie Commission Report, reports by committees investigating the purposes of schools have increasingly emphasised moral and social education as school objectives. The Department of Education appeared to be sympathetic towards the cause of moral education. The submissions made by the public during the Educational Development Conference suggested that, in general, parents and citizens were prepared to consider innovative programmes in social or moral education, although there was little agreement on what form such training or education should take. A number of teachers were supporters of moral education. The primary purpose in constructing tests for Wilson's components was to provide an instrument which would assist in the evaluation of moral education curriculum projects in Auckland secondary schools. Evidence concerning descriptive, content, domain selection, construct and concurrent validity is presented. Kuder-Richardson, retest and criterion-referenced reliability studies were undertaken. It is claimed that an instrument with sufficient validity and reliability has bean produced for the summative evaluation of curriculum projects, and the diagnostic investigation of class groups using the test as a criterion-referenced measure. Auckland intermediate and secondary school pupils were surveyed, using the tests produced and punch card recording in an attempt to identify significant variables. Over 1,100 children completed the tests under controlled conditions. Significant variables identified using the test for PHIL(CC) were socio-economic level for twelve-year-old children, and intelligence for sixteen-year-old children. The effect of schooling appeared to be significant at all levels. Age does not appear to markedly increase children's concern for others. Age was related to performance in the knowledge test. Older children knew more. Other significant variables for GIG were socio-economic level (middle levels performed better) and the effects of schooling. There was some evidence that females know more than males. In both tests it appears that there is considerable interaction between the variables. Suggestions for the further development of the tests are given.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An input-output model of Northland's economy: with application to forestry</field><field name="creator">Moore, Chris (Christopher Ivor),1947-</field><field name="description">This work presents a 50-industry input-output model of Northland's economy and demonstrates how input-output analysis could be used to enhance regional planning in New Zealand. As it is the first regional input-output model in this country to incorporate significant survey and secondary data the survey procedure and model construction are outlined. The input-output table is used to discuss important regional transactions and the purchase and sales patterns of industries. The model analyses industries' contributions to export receipts and import payments and calculates the impact of changes in export receipts on regional income and imports. A comprehensive multiplier analysis of Northland's economy covers output, income, employment and imports and confidence limits for the multipliers are developed using the Monte Carlo technique to simulate survey errors. The model explores the economic implications of forestry expansion in Northland and discusses the areas available for afforestation, planting rates, tree management, wood supply and wood processing options in the region. The modifications made to the model and data requirements for simulating forestry expansion are outlined and employment and income impacts given for three types of processing complexes and for forestry expansion as a whole. Finally an economic evaluation is made of the impacts of processing-plant construction and supporting services.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290500 Mechanical and Industrial Engineering::290501 Mechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Theoretical and applied mechanics, School of Engineering)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2467</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bonding in d10 transition metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Whiting, R.

(Cheng Yi), 1938-</field><field name="description">Building on Kibblewhite's long term investigations of the nonlinear wave-wave interactions and the infrasonic ocean noise and the microseisms these induce, this thesis further explores the physical nature of these processes. The classical description of this interaction, which takes into account only the homogeneous component of the induced field, has been extended to include the inhomogeneous component. A complete expression for the wave induced noise spectrum is established following a geometrical analysis of the dispersion relations among interacting waves. The relative importance of these two components and their directivity properties are also calculated and discussed. It is shown that while at observation points deeper than 500 meters the effects of the inhomogeneous component can be regarded as negligible, it can cause an increase of noise level of up to 40 dB in the region near the surface of the sea. Furthermore, in contrast to the nearly omni-directional distribution of the homogeneous component of the induced acoustic field, there is a tendency for the energy associated with the inhomogeneous component to focus in the wind direction. Based upon a multilayer analysis of a visco-elastic geoacoustic model, Green's functions and the spectral transfer functions relating the surface source pressure field to the underwater noise and microseism fields are derived for both near and far field cases. A 3-dimensional presentation defined on the dispersion plane (frequency and horizontal wave number) is introduced to describe the sea bottom reflection-loss and, Green's functions, and is extended to include the inhomogeneous region for the first time. The characteristics of this 3-D presentation are explained in terms of the geoacoustic parameters. The influence of the interaction of multiple seas (and swell) on the induced acoustic field are also discussed in this thesis. All these effects are considered in the calculation of the synthetic spectra of both the noise and microseism field. When compared with measured data excellent agreement is found between the theoretical and experimental results, which provides further confirmation that the nonlinear interaction is the most important source of the infrasonic ocean noise, as well as confirming the basic validity of the procedure introduced by Kibblewhite and Ewans to derive the ocean noise spectra from microseism records.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::240000 Physical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics) -- University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Growth and development of intellectually handicapped children</field><field name="creator">Sims, Margaret R.</field><field name="description">There have been no studies in New Zealand designed to investigate the effectiveness of the major "systems-based" intervention programme available for intellectually handicapped children; the service offered by the New Zealand Society for the Intellectually Handicapped. The Society does not have a standardised programme running in all its Preschool/Special Care Centres throughout the country. However, the Auckland branch developed a formalised approach to programming and teaching in 1979. This study attempted to determine the effectiveness of this new approach in terms of the children it was designed to benefit. It was found that children attending Auckland Preschool/Special Care Centres did show greater rates of progress than children attending Preschool/Special Care Centres outside Auckland for a variety of different skills. For Downs Syndrome children these were self-help, cognitive and language skills. For motor-delayed multihandicapped children the skills were selp-help and language. These differences persisted when differences between the social and environmental backgrounds of the children from Auckland and outside Auckland were controlled for. It was also found that Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children showed different rates of progress for motor, socialisation, cognitive/academic and language skills. Rates of progress were not different for self-help skills although the absolute level of achievement was significantly different for the three populations. The three groups of children showed different rates of growth in a variety of physical measurements, and different absolute sizes in several others. Downs Syndrome children have shorter limbs than either of the other two groups of children. They also have the narrowest jaws and a small thorax. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children have the smallest limb diameters but have the longest faces. Downs Syndrome, motor-delayed multihandicapped and normal children differ in several ways in their social and environmental backgrounds. Parents of Downs Syndrome children are older than parents of the other two groups. Mothers of intellectually handicapped children are less likely to have a job than mothers of normal children. Different health records are evident between the three populations. Normal children tend to be seen as more healthy by their parents. Intellectually handicapped children tend to have less ascorbic acid in their diet than normal children. Downs Syndrome children are more susceptible to minor environmental fluctuations than motor-delayed multihandicapped or normal children. The cumulative effect of this hostile environment can be seen in their short stature and smaller overall body dimensions compared to normal children. Motor-delayed multihandicapped children do not show the same reaction to the environment as Downs Syndrome children. In this more severely handicapped group, the effect of the motor and intellectual handicap over-rides any effect the environment might have. However, nutritional intake is closely related to physical growth in these children. This is because in most cases exercise does not mediate between nutritional intake and physical growth.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2471</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies in the Alseuosmiaceae</field><field name="creator">Gardner, R. O. (Rhys Owen), 1949-</field><field name="description">The flowering plant family Alseuosmiaceae comprises three genera of shrubs: Alseuosmia A. Cunn. from New Zealand; Memecylanthus Gilg and Schltr. and Periomphale Baill. (=Pachydiscus Gilg and Schltr.) from New Caledonia. These genera are readily excluded from their traditional position in the Caprifoliaceae by virtue of their alternate leaves, valvate corolla lobes and their southern hemisphere distribution. Four species of Alseuosmia, including one hitherto undescribed species, are accepted here. The New Caledonian genera are poorly represented in herbaria; they may each be monotypic. Condensed tannin (leucocyanidin) and ellagitannin are abundant in all Alseuosmia tissues. Other simple phenolic compounds here (as detected in acid hydrolysates) include quercetin, kaempferol, caffeic acid and p-coumaric acid. Triterpenoid saponins are abundant in leaf tissue; alkaloids and probably iridoid compounds too, are absent. Tannin is found throughout the ovary tissue of Alseuosmia and in the inner and outer epidermises of the ovular integument. The floral vascular anatomy is detailed for the Alseuosmiaceae and reviewed for eight allied families. No features of the vascular system imply particular affinity of the Alseuosmiaceae with any of these allies. Within this family the association of different morphological and anatomical floral features supports the contention that primitive characters tend to be associated with one another in their distribution throughout the members of a taxon. The primary vascular pattern in the stem of Alseuosmia is of an open (sympodial) nature. The mature nodal anatomy is 3-trace trilacunar. All genera have a stem endodermis with prominent Casparian banding, and in Alseuosmia at least this endodermis passes through the secondary and quaternary stages (lignification-suberisation of walls; accumulation of phenolic compounds) as found in a typical root endodermis. All species of Alseuosmia lack rays in the secondary wood, whereas memecylanthus and Periomphale have extremely tall (indefinitely-prolonged?) rays. The vessels of these genera are relatively primitive (end-plate angle c.10-19&#176;, no bars per scalariform plate c.16-37), and thus are comparable to vessels of the Escalloniaceae and Caprifoliaceae. The root periderm has a cortical origin in Alseuosmia and the root pith is persistent. Multicellular uniseriate hairs are found in the leaf axils in all Alseuosmiaceae. Hairs with similar structure and development are found in some genera of Pittosporaceae but not, so far as is known, in other related groups. Within Pittosporum, these uniseriate hairs appear to be homologous with the T-hairs many species have. The chromosome number of 2n=18 probably characterises all the species of Alseuosmia. A. macrophylla A. Cunn. is an obligate outbreeder with an incompatibility mechanism operating at the stylar level, while A. pusilla is self-compatible. Pollinating agents for the species are unknown. No internal barriers to hybridism exist between A. macrophylla and A. banksii A. Cunn. and the hybrid swarm between these species is recognised here as A. X quercifolia A. Cunn. Neither do internal barriers exist between A. macrophylla and A. pusilla, but differences in flowering time and mode of breeding help to keep these species separate in the field. Mature pollen of Alseuosmia is trinucleate: the ovule is uni-tegmic-tenuinucellate. The distinctness of the Alseuosmiaceae is upheld and its affinities are suggested to be with the Escalloniaceae, and to a lesser extent, with the Pittosporaceae.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1976.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dendroclimatic study of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha)</field><field name="creator">Palmer, Jonathan Gray</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates some of the potential of Phyllocladus trichomanoides D. Don (tanekaha) for dendrochronological research, especially dendroclimatology. The type of vegetation associated with sites producing a chronology showed no obvious pattern. The resulting non-specific range of suitable sites for dendrochronological sampling was thought to be a favorable species characteristic. Standardization of tree-ring series using a 50-year Gaussian filter resulted in 28% improvement of retained common variance above that obtained from using conventional polynomial filters. The problem of autocorrelation was investigated. Tanekaha had a consistent autocorrelation pattern through both space (i.e. latitudinal and altitudinal ranges) and time (preserved forest and contemporary stands). P. glaucus (toatoa) also showed a spatially consistent yet distinctive pattern. These different diagnostic patterns implied a non-climatic cause (i.e. physiological), illustrating the need to ensure their removal before species chronologies are compared or used for climate modelling. Low order autoregressive models (ARMA(p,0)) were used to filter out the significant levels of autocorrelation. Subsequent comparison of the chronologies showed a consistent and highly significantly correlated pattern between both sites and species. The paucity of information about the physiology of Phyllocladus spp. led to the testing of several climatic variables in response function analyses. The "best" variables (based on only statistical evidence) were minimum monthly temperature, monthly total raindays and an optimal 12 month span of August (t) to July (t+1). Preliminary attempts with response functions using different combinations of predictor (climate variables) and predictand (chronologies) data sets generally failed to verify. Neither the extent of time from which the response functions were based (no analogue situation) nor a supposed "physiological shock" period (poor growth period) were the causes for non-verification. Further investigation showed that, for both the individual and combined chronologies, the temperature response was similar but rainfall varied. The instability through time of the rainfall response was particularly disconcerting since it broke one of the fundamental assumptions used in dendroclimatology. It was therefore concluded that climatic reconstruction could be attempted only on the temperature data. The temperature data of three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) were tried with transfer function models. Of these the summer season explained the most variance and had the highest reduction of error(RE) values. The selected model used the period 1918 to 1982 for calibration and 1853 to 1917 for verification. Summer temperatures from 1982 to 1750 were reconstructed. The reconstruction modeled only c.30% of the variance but was highly correlated to the summer temperature series developed by Norton (1983). This was interpreted as further independent verification of the reconstructed series. The summer temperatures reconstructed from 1982 to 1750 were concluded to have been similar to the recorded pattern from 1853. The same regressors were applied to the buried forest chronology and the summer temperatures reconstructed from 105 BC to AD 175. Because of the non-continuous tree-ring record no comment can be made of actual ambient conditions in comparison to those of today. However, the reconstructed pre-Taupo summer series did show increased variation towards the time of the eruption and more pronounced cool summers than hot ones. Another applied use of a tanekaha chronology was demonstrated with 14C dating. A statistically significant fit of 14C ages was obtained between twelve contiguous decades from the buried forest tanekaha chronology with that from a Northern hemisphere decadal calibration curve based on Sequioadendron giganteum(Stuiver &amp; Becker 1986). This "wiggle-matching" to the calibration curve places the year of the Taupo eruption as AD 177&#177;18 10. An Independent check of the "new" date was conducted using the most reliable data of Healy et al. (1964) with the same calibration series as described above. A date of AD177&#177;4 44 was obtained which supports the wiggle-matched date. The confidence interval of the wiggle-matched date also coincides with the date proposed by Wilson et al. (1980) of AD186 (based purely on ancient written records).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The biological control of sapstain of Pinus radiata with microorganisms</field><field name="creator">Kay, Stuart James</field><field name="description">A total of six hundred and sixteen fungal and two hundred and thirty two bacterial isolates were obtained either from the sapwood of Pinus radiata or from other sources, including UV mutagenesis. All isolates were screened on Pinus radiata wood chips for their survival and colonisation attributes. Of these isolates, two hundred and eighty two failed to grow or caused permanent deep seated discolourations or decay and were eliminated from the study. The remaining five hundred and sixty six isolates were assessed for their antagonistic ability against sapstain. In a dual screen on Pinus radiata wood chips, one hundred and twelve fungal and four bacterial isolates inhibited the growth of the known sapstain fungus, Ophiostoma piceae. In a second biological control screen, on Pinus radiata wood blocks, isolates of Gliocladium viride, Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma hamatum, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichothecium roseum and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae proved inhibitory to the sapstain isolates Ophiostoma piceae and Sphaeropsis sapinea providing between 94 and 100% control. These isolates were considered for further examination in the field. The remaining isolates provided poor or inconsistent inhibition or were mould fungi and, therefore, not suitable for direct application. All fungal and bacterial isolates that had shown inhibitory ability in the initial biological control screen and the remaining non-staining bacteria were examined for their ability to produce non-volatile metabolites that were inhibitory to sapstain. The bacterial isolates were examined in a preliminary dual plate screen in which 91 isolates were identified as producing inhibitory compounds. The best of these bacterial isolates were screened, with the fungal isolates, in a non-volatile metabolite trial utilising filter sterilised culture filtrates. Isolates of Bacillus sp., Fusarium solani, Gliocladium roseum, Gliocladium virens, Trichoderma harzianum, Trichoderma sp., Trichoderma viride and Trichothecium roseum were found to be significantly inhibitory to the growth of Ophiostoma piceae at concentrations of 50% or less. However, the filtrates did not provide adequate sapstain control, when tested on Pinus radiata wood block, to prompt consideration for further examination in the field. Studies are currently examining several of these isolates for the production of biologically active compounds. The six most promising isolates, from the wood chip and wood block trials, were tested in the field for their ability to control sapstain on unseasoned Pinus radiata sapwood and/or peeled logs. These were Gliocladium viride (FK75), Trichoderma hamantum (FK561), Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247), Trichothecium roseum (FK238) and an isolate of the Thelephoraceae (FK33). The fungi were prepared as mycelial/spore homogenates. For application to the timber, the homogenates were mixed with 0.2% Alcosorb gel, producing 108 cfu/ml suspensions, these suspensions were applied by dipping. Diluted homogenates, 108 cfu/ml, were applied as spray treatments to the logs. All of the biological control agent treatments reduced the level of sapstain on either the logs or timber with Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) providing control equivalent to that of the fungicides NP-1 and Diffusol for portions of the trial. Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) gave sapstain control in excess of 90% for the first 30 days of the timber trial equalling the control provided by NP-1 and Diffusol. In another trial, Trichoderma harzianum (FK228) was more effective than NP-1, providing 60% sapstain control, after six months, on the internal tissue of Pinus radiata logs. The six isolates selected for the field trials were examined in additional studies. In a dual inoculation study, Trichoderma sp. (FK247) exhibited localised antibiotic ability causing the lysis of mycelium of sapstain fungi. There was no evidence of mycoparasitic action by any of the six isolates. Trichoderma harzianum (FK228), Trichoderma sp. (FK247) and Trichothecium roseum (FK238) were observed to degrade cellulose. However, neither these nor the other isolates caused a significant change in the mechanical properties of Pinus radiata timber when compared to untreated controls. Decreasing pH or the addition of nitrate were identified as having potential for the promotion of biological control agent growth. The potential of mixed biological control agent inoculations was also examined. While these results are preliminary, they are extremely encouraging and provide a basis from which future studies can develop.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1995.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gas transport and storage processes in the lacunar system of Egeria densa Planch.</field><field name="creator">Sorrell, Brian.</field><field name="description">Aquatic macrophytes possess an internal lacunar system of proliferated intercellular airspaces. Lacunar gas exchange processes were investigated in Egeria densa Planch., a submerged freshwater angiosperm. Investigations of oxygen exchange between Egeria shoot segments and the water revealed that up to 17% of the photosynthetically-produced oxygen is retained within the lacunae. A consequence of this partitioning, which results from the relatively low solubility of oxygen in water, is the development of internal lacunar pressures up to 20 kPa above atmospheric pressure. This storage of oxygen in Egeria casts doubts on oxygen-based measurements of productivity in aquatic macrophytes, unless both internal and external sinks are monitored. Pressurisation also revealed that storage is greater in static water than in flowing water, suggesting that boundary layer limitations to oxygen transfer can also affect partitioning. Pressures fall to sub-atmospheric values in the dark, due to respiratory consumption of the internal oxygen. The Egeria respiratory gas exchanges in the dark demonstrated a steady concentration gradient between plant and water within an hour of darkening. However, the material steadily consumes approximately 30% of its respired oxygen from the lacunae, rather than the water. This oxygen supply is again due to the low oxygen solubility. The lacunae also assist the radial oxygen supply into the respiring tissue; it was found that the Michaelis-Menten constant for the respiratory response to oxygen tension in Egeria was some two to three times greater in material with infiltrated lacunae than in uninfiltrated material. Oxygen storage in the stem lacunae resulted in a longitudinal (shoot to root) movement of this gas, which was monitored using a bicompartment apparatus. The root oxygen release rate varied with light intensity and water flow rate in a similar manner to the internal pressure changes. Further experiments, involving measurements of the oxygen flux rates in the Egeria rhizosphere, demonstrated that this root oxygen loss is capable of effecting substantial diurnal oxygen fluctuations in the surrounding sediment. These processes may be interrupted by natural infiltration of the airspaces, but the factors involved here remain uncertain. The mean internal oxygen transport rate in Egeria (6.28 &#956;102 h-1) was consistent with estimates of lacunar oxygen concentration gradients calculated from Fick's Law, suggesting that diffusion is the oxygen transport mechanism in Egeria. However, by connecting shoots into manometers, internal pressure gradients of some 0.9 kPa m-1 were detected. These gradients were 103 -fold greater than the pressure gradient required to account for oxygen transport in Egeria, but were transient features, as the pressure equilibrated throughout the lacunar system 20 - 30 minutes after a dark/light change. Mass flow was therefore proposed as a transitory, but potentially significant, contribution to oxygen transport. Root to shoot carbon dioxide transport was measured using 14CO2 tracing. The CO2 uptake (mean internal transport = 4.96 &#956;1CO2 h-1) represented &lt;10% of the total carbon fixed; the concentration of root-derived carbon in shoot tissue declined rapidly from the root insertion point. These results are compared with those of previous studies, and the significance of the Egeria lacunar system assessed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural studies of selected group VIII metal complexes</field><field name="creator">Marsden, Karen</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the single crystal x-ray analyses of six novel organometallic osmium complexes and three complexes of the tridentate dentate ligand 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene with the transition metals iridium, rhodium and ruthenium. The complexes of carbon monosulphide and carbon monotelluride with osmium, OsCl2(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2 and OsCl2(CO)(CTe)(PPh3)2, exhibit linear thio- and telluro-coordination similar to that of the carbonyl. The -CS and -CTe ligands exert strong trans-bond weakening influences. In the dihapto-thioacyl complex of osmium, Os(&#951;1-o2CCF3)[C(S)-(p-tolyl)](CO)(PPh3)2, the bidentate thioacyl is coordinated to the osmium through the carbon and sulphur atoms. This bonding involves a considerable degree of &#960;-interaction between the C, S and Os atoms, concomitant with a lengthening of the C-S bond. The dichlorocarbene complex, OsCl2(CO)(CCl2)(PPh3)2 is disordered in the crystalline state. Consequently, while the presence of the dichlorocarbene is verified, no unambiguous conclusions can be drawn from the associated geometry. In the carbyne complex of osmium, Os(C-p-tolyl)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2, the osmium is in a trigonal bipyramidal environment with an approximately linear arrangement of the Os-C-R group. The Os-Ccarbyne bond is short (corresponding to a bond order of ca. 3), confirming the formation of the C-p-tolyl group as a carbyne. The formaldehyde ligand in the osmium complex, Os(&#951;2-CH2O)(CO)2(PPh3)2, is bonded to the osmium centre via both the carbon and oxygen atoms. The C-O bond of the formaldehyde lengthens considerably upon coordination, resulting in a bond order apparently less than 1. Also present in the crystal structure are molecules of water which are hydrogen bonded into pairs (O&#8230;O separation 2.56 &#197;). The (H2O)2 units do not hydrogen bond to any other atoms, but rather occupy hydrophobic interstices in the structure. The three complexes of 1,6-bis(diphenylphosphino)-trans-hex-3-ene, (BDPH), IrIIICl3(BDPH), RhIIICl3(BDPH), and RuIICl2(CO)(BDPH) are isomorphous. The ruthenium complex is, however, disordered in the crystalline state. In each of the three structures the olefin of the BDPH moiety is only weakly bound to the metal, leaving the C-C double bond virtually unchanged from that of the free ligand. The olefin exerts a stronger trans-bond weakening influence than do the chlorine ligands in these complexes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1981.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2477</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Circadian organization in the regulation of locomotor activity and reproduction in Rattus exulans</field><field name="creator">Gander, Philippa H.</field><field name="description">The role of the circadian time-keeping system in regulation of locomotor activity and certain aspects of reproduction has been investigated in wild Polynesian rats, Rattus exulans. Locomotor activity is under circadian control and data are consistent with a general model of the pacemaker mechanism as a weakly interacting population of circadian oscillators. Experimental studies and field observations indicate that the action of light in entrainment of this rhythm is primarily non-parametric. Female R. exulans continue to ovulate during prolonged periods in constant conditions and undergo a pattern of change in vaginal cytology through the estrous cycle which closely resembles that of laboratory R. norvegicus. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the estrous cycle in R. exulans is regulated by a similar circadian mechanism to that controlling the timing of ovulation, and hence the duration of estrous cycle, in laboratory rats. Female R. exulans do not exhibit regular fluctuations in either the period of the activity rhythm or intensity of the active phase in association with the estrous cycle. Ovariectomy also has no significant effect on the period of the activity rhythm and no discernible effect on the distribution or intensity of activity. It is therefore concluded that there is no feedback action of the ovaries or estradiol on the circadian pacemaker regulating locomotor activity in R. exulans, which thus differs from laboratory rodents. This proposition is further supported by the observation that there are no significant changes in either period or variability of the activity rhythm in association with the degenerative changes that occur in the female reproductive system in old age. The adaptive significance of these findings is considered. Field studies on breeding patterns of R. exulans throughout its distribution provide several lines of indirect evidence in support of the hypothesis that the onset of breeding in this species in temperate latitudes is regulated by seasonal changes in photoperiod. Accelerated attainment of puberty occurs in juvenile females collected during the non-breeding part of the year and housed in LD 16:8. Juvenile females collected at the same times but housed in LD 8:16 for an identical duration remain immature. Groups of mature females collected during the breeding season do not show a differential response to these light regimes. These results are discussed in relation to field data on breeding patterns in the population from which experimental animals were collected. It is concluded that the onset of breeding in this population is controlled primarily by a photoperiodic mechanism regulating the attainment of reproductive maturity in females. Information on the physiological organization of circadian systems in mammals is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the relationships between locomotor activity rhythms, the estrous cycle, and the effects of photoperiod on reproductive function in rodents.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland, 1980.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of the life cycle, biological performance and quality of the black lyre leafroller 'Cnephasia' jactatana (Walker)</field><field name="creator">Ochieng'-Odero, James Patrick</field><field name="description">The thesis answers the general question of whether the quality of artificially reared insect species should be based on performance tests for intended use or whether quality should be based on a more holistic biological approach. The empirical research is carried out using the lepidopteran leafroller 'Cnephasia' jactatana (Walker). The thesis defines biological performance and quality in terms of the success of an insect population in survival and reproduction and regards the laboratory environment as an artificial habitat that insects must colonise in order to survive and reproduce. Changes in biological performance that occurred during 12 successive generations of laboratory rearing were due to selection, acclimatisation and domestication and not adaptation. Artificial colonisation is theoretically successful within a limited range of environmental factors. As the inherent genetic variability of the founder population determines the resilience of the population to changes in performance, the ranges of environmental factors during colonisation should be wide to 'capture' much of the variability. Using body size (weight) as an aspect of overall quality, the thesis presents evidence that the final instar larva of C. jactatana has a threshold mechanism (larval critical weight, LCW) that determines pupal and adult size. There is a proportionate decrease in weight from the maximum weight that a larva attains in the final instar (LMW) to pupa ( described as constant DP ) and to adult (DA). There is a direct relation between the latent feeding period (period between attaining an LCW and LMW), LMW, pupal and adult size, and the reproductive performance (fecundity ). Within the experimental conditions diet quality, temperature, photoperiod and artificial selection had no effect on the larval critical weight, DP or DA, the larval threshold mechanism in C. jactatana is probably a mechanical trigger that initiates pupation. Diet quality, temperature and thermophotoperiods affected pupal size, adult size and reproductive performance. Photoperiod had no significant effects on size and reproductive performance. Positive assortative selections for slow development and low pupal weight significantly decreased pupal and adult size, and reproductive performance. Selection for fast development and heavy pupal weight for three generations had no significant effect on size or reproductive performance. Larval critical weight is demonstrated as useful to define quality indices and predict the performance of laboratory reared insects. The general conclusion of the thesis is that insect quality should be defined more in terms of the success in survival and colonising ability rather than solely on the success for 'intended role' or 'fitness for use'.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Zoology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of a signal as a function of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise</field><field name="creator">Stillman, Jennifer A.</field><field name="description">A series of experiments was undertaken to explore the effect of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise upon the detection of a signal. The signal was a 2-kHz sinusoid, and the masker was composed of either one or two 800-Hz wide bands of noise. The centre frequencies of the two bands of noise, one above and one below the signal frequency, were varied. On most occasions both noise bands were used to create a spectral notch surrounding the signal. The following factors were manipulated: (1) The width of the notch: from 0 to 1900 Hz. (2) The location of the lower and upper frequency edges of the notch relative to the signal: either equidistant from the signal, or with one edge 150 Hz nearer to the signal than the other edge. (3) The spectrum level of the noise: either 20, 35 or 50 dB SPL. (4) The degree of interaural disparity in the intensity of some components of the noise: either 0 dB, 10 dB or infinite. (5) The ear to which a particular masking noise was sent. (6) The manner in which the noise was presented: either diotically or dichotically. (7) The manner in which the signal was presented: either diotically or monotically. The results of the first two experiments were interpreted as showing that threshold signal levels in the presence of interaural differences in the intensity of masking noise depended principally on the ear in which the signal-to-masker ratio at the output of the auditory filter was larger. To test this possibility, auditory filter shapes were derived from two listeners. These were then used to predict thresholds when there were interaural differences in the spectral envelope of a masking noise. The results of a comparison between the predicted and obtained thresholds were consistent with the previous interpretation. Thus it appears that the detector following the filter can discriminate the output of the two ears and base detection on the better output. This ability may be useful in normal listening, where both wanted and extraneous sounds are subject to change from moment to moment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional promoters in a replication region of F plasmid</field><field name="creator">Kennedy, Martin A.</field><field name="description">This thesis describes aspects of genetic regulation within and near a replication origin (ori-1) of the F plasmid. A number of transcriptional promoters were isolated, precisely mapped, and characterized with respect to their strengths and modes of regulation. The principal techniques employed in these investigations were: "shotgun" molecular cloning of restriction fragments into a galactokinase-based promoter selection vector, assays for galactokinase activities, DNA sequencing and S1 nuclease mapping of transcripts. Major findings from this study can be summarized as follows: 1). Promoters for the essential replication genes pifC and E were cloned and shown to be autoregulated at the transcriptional level. 2). An E.coli protein, integration host factor (IHF), was found to modulate the activity of the pif operon promoter. 13). Two promoters which direct transcription in opposite directions from within the minimal ori-1 region were discovered. 4). Transcription from both ori-1 promoters was shown to be repressed by the mini-F encoded D protein. 5). Precise transcriptional startsites of the pifC gene and the two ori-1 promoters were determined. 6). A mini-F protein (D) was shown to resolve dimers of a plasmid which contains a site-specific recombination locus from near ori-1, and a facile assay system for this function was developed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270100 Biochemistry and Cell Biology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Cell Biology)--University of Auckland, 1986.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance and network governance in international joint ventures: case studies of three China-New Zealand JVs</field><field name="creator">Kang, Yuanfei</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationships between performance, evolution and network governance of international joint ventures from a dynamic perspective. This is accomplished with a two-stage examination of case studies on the China-New Zealand joint ventures in China, involving two case studies in the first stage and one case study in the second stage. The exploratory and narrative research aims to aid theory building in the area of assessment and determination for IJV performance. In an investigation of the case IJVs between the Chinese and New Zealand firms, the study results in the development of three conceptual models of IJV performance and network relationships, namely, the Static Goal Model, the Goal Succession Model, and the Goal Emergence Model. These conceptual models adopt goal attainment as the criterion for assessing UV performance, and address goal attainment from a dynamic perspective by using a network approach. The theoretical models are illustrated and supported by the empirical evidence from the longitudinal case studies. The conceptual models differ from existing models of IJV performance in a number of important aspects, and thus contribute to theory relating to IJV performance in the following ways. These models integrate the concepts from the three research areas of performance, governance structure and dynamic evolution into a conceptual framework addressing IJV performance. Two types (organisational and interpersonal) of IJV network relationships are identified, and complex multiple tiers of network relationships in each type and their influence on JV performance and evolution are discussed. The study highlights the influence of network relationships and their evolution on IJV performance by arguing that IJV performance hinges on whether a trend of institutionalising the mechanism of trust building and conflict resolution and of balancing the network relationships within the IJV arrangement emerges from the process of IJV dynamic evolution.

Ascochytula obiones (Jaap) Died., the type species of Ascochytula, is considered to be congeneric with Ascochyta pisi Lib., the type species of the earlier genus, Ascochyta Lib. Ascochytula is thus reduced to synonymy with Ascochyta. Of the thirty-six species and two varieties named in, or directly associated with, Ascochytula, twenty are herein described as species of Ascochyta and four are excluded from Ascochyta. The remaining species were either not examined, or are nomina dubia. The following names are proposed: Ascochyta asparagina (Petrak) comb. nov., A. deformis (P. Karsten) comb. nov., A. dorycnii (Petrak) comb. nov., A. ludwigiana (Petrak) comb. nov., A. moravica (Petrak) comb. nov., A. obiones (Jaap) comb. nov., A. phlomidicola nom. nov., and A. ulicis (Grove) comb. nov. Ascochytella Tassi, which has often been confused with Ascochytula, is also synonymised with Ascochyta. The original thirteen species in Ascochytella were examined, and A. vicina (Sacc.) Tassi chosen as the lecto-type species. Most of the thirteen species are regarded as being either misplaced in Ascochytella, or nomina dubia, and only four, including the lectotype, are accepted as species of Ascochyta. The name, Placodiplodia canthiifolia (Cooke &amp; Massee) comb. nov. is proposed. The type species of Ascochyta, and of six related genera, Ascochytulina Petrak, Coniothyrium Corda. Diplodina Westend., Pseudodiplodia (P. Karsten) Sacc., Scolecosporiella Petrak, and Stagonospora (Sacc.) Sacc. were studied to determine the distinctions between these six genera and Ascochyta. Microdiplodia Allescher and Diplodia Fr. are also discussed, in relationt to Ascochyta. Ascochyta paspali (H. Sydow) Punith. (&#8801; Ascochytula paspali H. Sydow), which causes a leaf stripe disease of Paspalum dilatatum Poir., an important perennial grass of northern North Island pastures, was examined in detail. At some temperatures, under controlled climate conditions, the fungus significantly reduced the yield of P. dilatatum. A. paspali was found to grow systemically, as mycelium within the xylem vessels, and was able to infect all parts of the plant, including the roots and seeds. Green leaves sometimes became infected systemically without production of visual symptoms. Infected seed is suggested as a means for disease spread. No teleomorph for A. paspali was found, and the fungus is thought to over-winter in the dormant grass. The seasonal fluctuation in levels of P. dilatatum and of the disease was studied in two Northland pastures with paspalum as a component. One pasture was studied for fourteen months, and the other for four months. Disease levels, and paspalum levels, were determined by point quadrat analysis and by sorting of randomly cut samples. Levels of both the host and of the disease peaked in summer, while both were at low levels, or apparently absent, over the winter months.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270400 Botany</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2487</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Judgement as play: revealing analogies between aesthetics and ethics</field><field name="creator">Kovach, Vanya</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the similarities of process between aesthetic experience and ethical judgement. I claim that in both cases the activity is best described as a type of play in which elements interact in mutual adjustment and transformation. This conception of play has its roots in Kant's aesthetic theory. Describing aesthetic experience as play results in emphasis on three central characteristics. These characteristics become the basis of constraints on judgement. In the case of ethical judgement these are important because they save from subjectivism a moral theory, particularism, which relies on individual judgement rather than moral rules. Seeing the activity of judgement as play suggests a conception of the outcome of judgement as picturing. This conception helps to make sense of reason-giving within the particularist model. A further analogy with the grounds of aesthetic qualities is used to illuminate the problem of justifying the values put into play. These values are ultimately defended in terms of their relationship to human flourishing. Perennial problems for theories based on human flourishing are avoided by my account because prescriptions for action are not derived from the characterisation of flourishing but from the process of individual judgement which values based on flourishing merely inform. One positive effect of adopting my model of judgement as play is the reduction of problems concerning the motivation to act on ethical judgements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440100 Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Philosophy)--University of Auckland, 1993.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate)</field><field name="creator">Meikle, John Boyd, 1940-</field><field name="description">The mechanical properties of glassy poly (methyl methacrylate) have been examined by means of constant strain-rate tests at differing strain-rates and temperatures.

The bracing requirements of these trusses are compared with the requirements of the bracing to pinned columns, which are the same size as the compression chord of the trusses, and have either a constant or stepwise parabolic distribution of axial load. It is found for most bracing cases, that the critical load and the bracing requirements for a truss, can be closely estimated from an analysis of a column with a "parabolic" axial load distribution.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploitation of geothermal reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Krol, Dexter E.</field><field name="description">This work presents a numerical model for simulating the response of a geothermal reservoir to exploitation. The techniques developed are more efficient and in many ways superior to those of previous investigators. The model is capable of yielding a description of transient mass and heat flow in either a one- or two-dimensional reservoir defined by Cartesian or cylindrical coordinates. The techniques enable simulation of a geothermal flow in all three thermodynamic states &#8211; compressed water, two-phase and superheated steam regions &#8211; and transitions between these states. The model is able to simulate a geothermal system where the presence of carbon dioxide as a second component influences exploitation response. Results are presented for a range of reservoir states. The effects of different physical parameters are considered. The usefulness of the model for looking at real systems is demonstrated by simulating the development of Wairakei and Broadlands geothermal areas in New Zealand.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A theory for schooling improvement: consistency and connectivity to improve instructional practice</field><field name="creator">Annan, Brian</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the problem of how to speed up the process through which professional educators learn how to significantly improve disadvantaged students&#8217; academic achievement. The problem is addressed through three questions: (i) What are the most effective national and international examples of school improvement? (ii) What is the condition of the evidence base for making claims of effectiveness? (iii) What can be learned about developing and implementing effective school improvement from those national and international examples? The thesis begins by searching international and national school improvement literature to find those initiatives with the strongest evidence of effectiveness. One initiative in England (the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies) and four initiatives in the United States (Success For All, Direct Instruction, The School Development Programme &amp; a district-wide reform in New York District #2) were considered to have strong evidence of effectiveness. Two initiatives in New Zealand (the Numeracy Development Project &amp; the Strengthening Education in Mangere and Otara project commonly called SEMO) had evidence that showed promise. It is argued that patterns of investment in different types of evaluation and ease of access to achievement information account for the difference between the strong international evidence and promising evidence in New Zealand. A series of investigations in the middle of the thesis focus on the processes set up in the initiatives to help practitioners learn effective reform practices. Three models of learning processes are developed which reveal a strong preference for vertical learning in England and the United States and a more balanced vertical-horizontal learning preference in New Zealand. Despite those contrasts, three characteristics were found to be common to all seven effective initiatives. They are a sharp focus on instructional improvement, a set of standardised practices, and, learning connections to transfer the reform ideas into practice. The latter part of the thesis transforms those three characteristics into a theory for schooling improvement which contribute to a faster and more effective reform process.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2575</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asians in New Zealand: a geographical review and interpretation</field><field name="creator">Taher, Mohommod</field><field name="description">Throughout the history of mankind there have been migrations of groups of people for economic, political, social, cultural and various other reasons.

Nor is the situation static.  Large dams and associated villages stand in areas which only a decade ago were remote and uninhabited, lakes are being drained and swamps reclaimed in the search for coal, and a man-made thermal area has been created, as spectacular as any natural one.  Plans are made and changed, and before one large power development is completed another has been commenced.

A particular study is made of the hydromagnetic wave theory and of the probability of these waves being produced by gyrating charged particles in the magnetosphere. The conditions are discussed under which gyration-induced hydromagnetic waves have frequencies within the micropulsation range. Assuming the production of Alfv&#233;n waves by some process in the magnetosphere, a layer model is developed to investigate the transmission of these waves down along the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field lines to the ionosphere. One feature of this model is a realistic ionospheric termination, in which a phase shift and amplitude reduction may be introduced into back reflected waves. Calculations using the model indicate a definite harmonic structure associated with micropulsations and only a small variation of frequency with geomagnetic latitude; they also provide a good explanation of the frequency structure and diurnal variation of &#8216;pearls&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::260000 Earth Sciences::260200 Geophysics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Physics)--University of Auckland, 1965.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">X-ray structural investigations of bromo-oxoditerpenoids and the nickel (II) chelate of a pyridoxal-amino acid intermediate</field><field name="creator">Cutfield, John Franklin</field><field name="description">The crystal structure of bis-(pyridoxylidene-L-valine)nickel(II) hydrate (referred to as nickel(II) pyridoxylidene L-valine) has been determined but the difficulty in detecting small deviations from body-centred symmetry, and in locating all solvent molecules, has precluded an accurate analysis.

Subjects were placed in small for gestational age, pre-term appropriate for gestational age, control, pre-term small for gestational age, low birth weight with gastroenteritis and very low birth weight groups. Assessment was blind and, where necessary, groups were randomly selected. Data were gathered from four stages of the subjects&#8217; development; the pregnancy, the newborn period, pre-school and school age. Analysis of pregnancy data showed that some aspects of the intrauterine environment provided by a number of mothers was less than optimal. In the neonatal period, the low birth weight groups were at some disadvantage and, further, there were aspects where there was some evidence that either the treatment or the condition for which it was required could possiblY influence subsequent development. The pre-school period was marked by sex differences, particularly in cognitive functioning. Disadvantage in all instances was confined to the low birth weight male groups. Some events in the prenatal, perinatal and neonatal periods appeared to be associated with poorer performance on intelligence tests more than four years later. Among these influences were mothers' smoking habits, temperature, duration of tube feeding and gastroenteritis while in hospital. Assessment at school revealed the same pattern of cognitive development among the subgroups that had been apparent at the pre-school stage. The pre-term males found adjustment to school difficult and made slow progress in reading in comparison with the females belonging to the same group. At this age the term - small for gestational age group was still lagging behind in physical development. It was concluded that the low birth weight males constituted a group who were &#8216;at risk&#8217; because of slower cognitive development. This was particularly evident in so far as the pre-term males were concerned.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1977.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes</field><field name="creator">Turner, Marianne</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis was to understand the function, design and distribution of New Zealand adzes, aspects little studied in Polynesia as a whole. Methodology involved functional and manufacturing replication experiments and comparisons of these results with statistics derived from the analysis of almost 12,000 archaeological adzes. Methodology was guided by technological organization theory which states that technological strategies reflect human behaviours and that artefacts like adzes are physical manifestations of the strategies employed by people to overcome problems posed by environmental and resource conditions. Variability in adze morphology was discovered to be the outcome of ongoing technological adjustments to a range of conditions that were constrained by a set of functionally defined parameters. The nature of the raw material, both for the adzes themselves and to make them, had a major influence on adze technology and morphology within these functional parameters. Four basic functional adze types were identified fi-om distinct and consistent combinations of design attributes not previously recognized explicitly in previous adze typologies. It was found that design attributes previously considered significant like crosssection shape and butt reduction were more heavily influenced by raw material quality than functional specifications. It was also important to recognize that form and function changed over time with use, and because adzes were so valuable due to manufacturing costs, they were intensively curated. The majority of archaeological specimens studied for this thesis had seen major morphological and functional change. This dynamic was included ,in a typology based on 'adze state7 as findings suggested (1) that extending adze use-life and optimizing reworking potential was incorporated in initial design strategies, (2) that intensive curation may have played a major role in changes in adze morphology over time, and (3). that it had a major influence on distribution and discard patterns in the archaeological record. Having identified these influences on adze discard and distribution, two complex production and distribution networks were observed for the North Island based around Tahanga basalt and Nelson~Marlborough argillite. Each was complimentary to the other and involved other major and minor products and materials. Influential factors in the roles different settlements played in distribution included where people and raw materials were in relation to one another and the mode of transportation. The coastal location of early period settlements and important stone sources was an important aspect of these networks.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Anthropology, Archaeology (0324)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420305 New Zealand cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/26</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analogues of Natural Product-like Scaffolds: Synthesis of Spiroacetal Derivatives</field><field name="creator">Choi, Ka Wai</field><field name="description">Diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) involves the synthesis of several synthetic targets by transforming a collection of structurally simple and similar starting materials into a collection of structurally more complex and diverse products.

Groups of teachers who had uniformly high or low expectations for their students were identified, and their instructional practices, beliefs and effects on the academic and social outcomes for their students were explored in four studies. Study One explored the academic outcomes for students in the high and low expectation teachers' classrooms over a year. Students in the classes of teachers with uniformly high expectations for their students made significantly greater progress in reading than their counterparts in the classes of teachers who had low expectations for their students. Study Two involved observations of the instructional and interactional practices of the different groups of teachers. Those with high expectations for all their students spent more time instructing their students, more frequently provided their students with a framework for their learning, questioned their students more and provided them with more feedback on their learning than the teachers who had uniformly low expectations. It also appeared from the observational data that the teachers who had uniformly high expectations for their students' learning provided a more positive socioemotional climate in which instruction took place. In Study Three the different groups of teachers were interviewed regarding their beliefs about how learning should be provided to students with high or low ability. It was found that the high expectation teachers believed there should be less differentiation in the learning opportunities provided to their low and high ability students than did the low expectation teachers. The former group of teachers also reported providing their students with more choice in their learning than did the latter group of teachers. Study Four focused on the academic and social self-perceptions of the students. The academic self-perceptions of the students who were in the classes with teachers who had high iii expectations for their learning increased across the school year while those in classrooms with teachers who had low expectations for their learning decreased. A model is built whereby it is suggested that teachers' expectations for their classes can have major effects on opportunities to learn, instructional practices, interactional patterns, student self-perceptions and academic outcomes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Education, Educational Psychology (0525)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Educational Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/28</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vessel source pollution and key international conventions: a case for change</field><field name="creator">Gray, J.A. (John Andrew)</field><field name="description">Pollution from vessels cannot be controlled effectively without the involvement of flag States. They have the primary responsibility for ensuring that the vessels which fly their flags comply with all applicable international rules and standards relating to vessel source pollution. Compliance with such rules and standards involves additional operating costs for ship-owners. Thus, in the highly competitive international maritime transport industry, there are many incentives for flag States not to prejudice their pursuit of comparative advantage by ensuring that their flag vessels comply with the applicable rules and standards. Enforcing their flag vessels to comply is not a rational choice. Accordingly, flag States must be given reasons to ensure that their flag vessels do comply with pollution control rules and standards if the problem of vessel source pollution is to be resolved. Neither of the two international Conventions which regulate the control of vessel source pollution, namely MARPOL and UNCLOS III, gives flag States reasons to ensure the compliant operation of their flag vessels. For that reason, neither Convention can claim to be an effective means for controlling pollution from vessels. There is, however, emerging evidence of flag State commitment to the control of vessel source pollution in response to the application of regional Port State Control measures. From the perspective of flag States, one aspect of the application of the concept of Port State Control is of concern - that is the legal basis of the control measures which are being taken against their flag vessels for violations of MARPOL's rules and standards.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::390000 Law, Justice and Law Enforcement::390100 Law</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Law)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/2868</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Examining 'globalisation' and 'convergence': A comparative study of university systems in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand, 1946--1996 (China)</field><field name="creator">Li, Lucinda Kit Ching</field><field name="description">Globalisation has been a subject of intense debate and continual investigation in academic circles for almost 20 years. However, the opinions on what it is and what impact it makes on national systems are still as diverse and divided as ever. This research is an endeavour to contribute further to the understanding of the processes and outcomes of globalisation by undertaking a cross-national historical study of four university systems and four elite universities over an extended period of time. By comparing and juxtaposing the changes in university objectives, provision, funding and regulation between 1946 and 1996, it seeks to establish whether globalisation has reduced national variations and led to convergence in university policies and practices.    This research is structured in three parts. Part I incorporates three chapters: one on the analysis of globalisation and its driving forces; one on the concept of convergence and its manifestations in higher education; and one on the methodology of research. These three chapters together advance an understanding of the mechanisms constituting the convergence hypothesis and its investigation. Part II is comprised of four case studies which provide empirical evidence on the impact of globalisation and the investigation of the hypothesis. Part III provides an integrated analysis of the outcomes as well as a final appraisal of the study itself.    Findings show that global forces do have a strong homogenising tendency causing a high level of convergence across cultures and nations. But convergence is not an inevitable outcome of globalisation. A complicated picture of convergence and divergence is found. It is shown to be possible to have convergence in one aspect of the same policy and divergence in another, as in the examples of female participation and medium of instruction. It is also possible to have convergence among some countries but not others, as in the case of university regulation. The actual result depends on, one, the aspect of policy selected for study; and, two, the dynamic interactions of the following factors: the driving impetus of economic globalisation, the powerful influence of hegemonic states and mighty economic and trade supranational organisations, and the willingness and ability of the nation-states to make the changes. That is to say, the impact of global forces is context-bound. The evidence of both convergence and divergence present at the same time vindicates the complexity and contingent nature of the globalisation process. A more accurate assessment of global effects requires a proper conceptualisation of convergence, the necessary investigation of the global-national-institutional interfaces, and longitudinal comparative studies of different cultures and nations, as illustrated by this study.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/29</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating New Zealanders:  Education and the formation of the state and the building of the nation</field><field name="creator">Stephenson, Maxine Sylvia</field><field name="description">Educational activity preceded official British presence in New Zealand. The development of the New Zealand state from crown colony, to a system of relatively autonomous provincial councils, to a centralized administration took place within a period of four decades. Co-terminous with and essential to the state's progressive securing of its authority was the institutionalization of separate national systems of education for Maori and Pakeha.    Whilst the ascendancy of the state and the securing of education as a central state concern proceeded ultimately with the sanction of the state and in accordance with its objectives it was not a straight forward process in a young nation which was born democratic, but was struggling to consolidate political and cultural unity. The various stages and the ultimate form that education in New Zealand took were closely linked to shifts in the nature and role of the state in its formative years, in the nature of its relationship with civil society, and in its official relationship with Maori. This provided the context and dynamic of the shift to state control as public schooling came to dominate over private or voluntary efforts, and as the particularism of isolated provincial settlements was replaced by a system designed to serve the nation as a whole.    Positing conceptual links between the development of national education and the processes of state formation and nation building in a colonizing context, this thesis argues that the institutionally differentiated form that universal education took in New Zealand produced a site through which socially, culturally and ideologically determined conceptions of &#8220;normality&#8221; would be legitimated and become hegemonic. By nationalizing education to legitimate a culture of uniformity based on a specific set of norms, individual New Zealanders were differentially created according to class, gender and ethnicity, and to physical, intellectual, behavioural and sensory functioning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HISTORY OF (0520)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SOCIOLOGY OF (0340)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education::330100 Education Studies</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/30</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Being aged' in the Everyday: uncovering the meaning through elders' stories</field><field name="creator">Wright-St Clair, Valerie A</field><field name="description">It&#8217;s like the sun and the tide. The aim of this study was to understand the meaning of &#8216;being aged&#8217; through the everyday experiences of those who are aged. Philosophically, this interpretive study was informed by hermeneutics and interpretive phenomenology. The writings of two twentieth-century philosophers, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Martin Heidegger, guided the study&#8217;s design and research methods. The phenomenon of interest is &#8216;being aged;&#8217; a thing which is ordinarily taken-for-granted in the everyday. However, much is already spoken and empirically &#8216;known&#8217; about the phenomenon by those who are not yet aged. Methodologically the study&#8217;s design sought to &#8216;put aside&#8217; those voices and listen in closely to what elders themselves had to say about being in their everyday lives. Individual research conversations were conducted with fifteen participants; four Maori elders aged 71 to 93 and eleven non-Maori elders aged 80 to 97 years. All were living in private residences on Auckland&#8217;s North Shore and recruited by way of the general electoral roll. The conversations were focused on gathering the stories of particular everyday events as well as the person&#8217;s reflections on aging. Anecdotes drawn from the conversations formed the research text. Hermeneutics informed the interpretive engagement with this text. As a non-Maori researcher, cultural integrity of the text and the interpretations was enhanced through partnership with a Maori advisor. Dwelling hermeneutically with the anecdotal text was a way of listening to the spoken and unspoken words. Four overarching notions were illuminated and form the study&#8217;s findings. They are my interpretive descriptions of the ordinary ways of &#8216;being in the everyday,&#8217; the experiences of &#8216;being with others&#8217; in advanced age, the announcing of being aged in the uncomfortableness of &#8216;experiencing the unaccustomed&#8217; and how &#8216;aging just is&#8217; there in an everyday way. Reflecting phenomenologically on the findings, the meaning of being aged is in its ordinariness. My thesis is that being in the ordinary everyday in advanced age both conceals and reveals the phenomenon of being aged.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">hermeneutic</field><field name="subject">phenomenology</field><field name="subject">everyday</field><field name="subject">aging</field><field name="subject">elders</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321007 Geriatrics and gerontology</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--General Practice)--University of Auckland, 2008.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3080</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intracellular signalling by arachidonic acid metabolites</field><field name="creator">Berry, Elicia Bee Ean</field><field name="description">In intrauterine tissues, pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs) have been identified as key mediators in the maintenance of pregnancy and parturition. The rise in PGD2 detected in the amniotic fluid before labour prompted the research presented in this thesis which describes the effects of 15-deoxy &#916;12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), a non-enzymatic metabolite of PGD2, on amnion-derived WISH and JEG3 choriocarcinoma cells as models of the amnion and chorion trophoblasts, respectively.15d-PGJ2 induced apoptosis in both cell lines in a concentration-dependent fashion (2.5-10 &#181;M). Apoptosis was characterised by condensation of chromatin (visualised after Hoechst 33342 staining), appearance of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation upon electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis, and activation of caspase-3. Apoptotic cell death was inhibited in the presence of serum (0.5% w/v) and albumin, not serumderived growth factors (insulin growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2 or epidermal growth factor (EGF), was determined as the key survival factor. Since 15d-PGJ2 is reported to activate peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-&#947;, the activities of PPARs were assessed using JEG3 cells transfected with a PPAR-response element reporter construct (pTK-PPREx3-luc). The PPAR-&#947;-specific ligand, rosiglitazone, induced PPRE mediated activity in a concentration-dependent manner, while the PPAR-&#947;-specific irreversible inhibitor, GW9662, fully inhibited this induction. However, GW9662 only partially inhibited 15d-PGJ2-induced luciferase activity, suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 may also activate either of the other isoforms. The expressions of PPAR-&#945; and -&#948; were identified in amnion, choriodecidua and placental membranes and PPAR-&#948; was significantly increased all tissues with labour. PPAR-&#945; expression was reduced in chorio-decidua, but was significantly higher in placenta with labour. The changes observed with labour suggest that regulation of PPAR expression and function may have a role in the mechanisms that maintain pregnancy or initiate labour. The anti-inflammatory effects of 15d-PGJ2 were also investigated by measuring interleukin (IL)-1&#946;-stimulated prostaglandin and cytokine productions by WISH cells after treatment with 15d-PGJ2 for 3 hours. 15d-PGJ2 exerted differential effects that were dependent upon its concentration. At low nanomolar physiologic concentrations (1-10 nM), 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2, but not cytokine (IL-6/IL-8) production or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression. This effect was attenuated by GW9662, by transfection with dominant negative PPAR constructs, and was reproduced by rosiglitazone. At micromolar (1-10 &#181;M) concentrations, 15d-PGJ2 inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated COX-2, PGE2 and cytokine productions and these effects were not blocked by GW9662 or mimicked by rosiglitazone. GW501516 (PPAR-&#948; agonist) also inhibited IL-1&#946;-stimulated PGE2 production, but only at high concentrations (1 &#181;M). IL-1&#946;-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity was significantly inhibited by 15d-PGJ2 (10 &#181;M) and GW501516 (1 &#181;M), but increased by rosiglitazone (10 &#181;M). In conclusion, this is the first report of an effect of 15d-PGJ2 at low nanomolar physiologic concentrations and 15d-PGJ2 mediates its actions through PPAR-&#947; (&lt;0.1 &#181;M) and PPAR-&#947;-independent(1-10 &#181;M) pathways, the latter through inhibition of NF-kB and/or activation of PPAR-&#948;. Further studies on the effect of physiologic concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 on primary gestational tissues will provide understanding on the role(s) 15d-PGJ2 plays in fetal membrane remodelling and its involvement in the inflammatory processes associated with labour and parturition.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural progenitor cells in the Huntington's Disease human brain</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Maurice A</field><field name="description">The recent demonstration of endogenous progenitor cells in the adult mammalian brain raises the exciting possibility that these undifferentiated cells may be able to generate new neurons for cell replacement in diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells in the rodent brain subependymal layer (SEL), adjacent to the caudate nucleus, proliferate and differentiate into neurons and glial cells but no previous study has characterised the human SEL or shown neurogenesis in the diseased human brain. In this study, histochemical and immunohistochemical techniques were used to demonstrate the regional anatomy and staining characteristics of the normal and HD brain SEL using light and laser scanning confocal microscopy. The results demonstrated that the normal and HD SEL contained migrating neuroblasts, glial cells and precursor cells but there were more of each cell type present in the HD brain, and that the increase in cell numbers correlated with HD neuropathological grade. The normal and HD SEL was stained with a proliferative marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), to label dividing cells. The results showed a significant increase in the number of dividing cells in the HD brain that correlated with HD grade and with CAG repeat length. Furthermore, the results showed that neurogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by co-localisation of PCNA and the neuronal marker &#946;III-tubulin. Also, gliogenesis had occurred in the SEL as evidenced by the co-localisation of PCNA with the glial marker GFAP. These studies also revealed a 2.6 fold increase in the number of new neurons in the HD SEL. PCNA positive cells were distributed throughout the SEL overlying the caudate nucleus but most notably the ventral and central regions of the SEL adjacent to the caudate nucleus contained the highest number of proliferating cells. I examined the SEL for mature cell markers and demonstrated many of the same cell types that are present in the normal striatum. With the exception of neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons, there was a reduction in the number of mature neurons in the HD SEL. The NPY neurons were more abundant in the HD SEL suggesting they play a role in progenitor cell proliferation. The results in this thesis provide evidence of increased progenitor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the diseased adult human brain and indicate the regenerative potential of the human brain. These findings may be of major relevance to the development of therapeutic approaches in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anatomy and Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3114</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrophysiological and behavioural measures of central auditory processing in adult cochlear implant users</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Andrea Susan</field><field name="description">This study aimed to determine the relationship between auditory evoked potential measures, speech perception and frequency discrimination in 12 experienced adult cochlear implant (CI) users and to compare the evoked potential results in the CI subjects to those of a group of age- and gender-matched control subjects with normal hearing. The CI subjects all used the Nucleus CI-22 implant with the SPEAK processing strategy. Subject age range was 27-74 years (mean 50.9 years). All had used their implant for a minimum of one year (range 13-76 months, mean duration of implant use 37.5 months).Duration of profound deafness prior to implantation ranged from 1 - 40 years (mean 15.6 years).Middle latency response (MLR), obligatory N1-P2 cortical potentials, mismatch negativity and P3a auditory evoked potential were recorded. Speech perception was evaluated using tests from "The Minimum Speech Test Battery for Adult Cochlear Implant Users". Frequency discrimination was measured using a two-alternative forced choice procedure, to record difference limens (DL) for a 1000Hz tone. Duration of deafness correlated strongly with speech perception scores with poor scores reflecting greater years of deafness. The most sensitive of all the evoked potential measures was P2 latency, with strong relationships found between P2 and duration of deafness and speech perception scores. Earlier P2 latencies were associated with shorter durations of deafness and higher speech perception scores. In general, mismatch negativity was absent or degraded in CI subjects with poor speech scores. In better implant users mismatch negativity was typically present to both large and small frequency differences and demonstrated characteristic changes of increased latency and decreased area and amplitude for the more difficult discrimination task (as seen in the normal hearing group). Na amplitude of the MLR correlated negatively with duration of deafness, with small amplitudes reflecting greater duration of deafness. Frequency DLs were very variable, and no strong relationships were found between these and the evoked potential or speech perception measures.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Audiology)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3126</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression and activity of enzymes in the human placenta: pharmacological &amp; toxicological consequences in AZT therapy</field><field name="creator">Collier, Abby Cherise</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to study xenobiotic metabolising enzymes (XME) in the human placenta, in particular the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases' (UGTs) role in the metabolism, transfer and disposition of the drug AZT, and to develop the human placental perfusion model into the first trimester. UGT, &#946;-glucuronidase, Cytochrome p4501A (CYPIA) and CYP reductase were present and active in the human placenta. CYP2E1 protein was expressed but not active. CYPIA, CYP2EI and the UGT2B subfamily were expressed across gestation, but the UGTIA subfamily was only expressed in first trimester placentas. The localisation of XME (the syncytiotrophoblast layer bordering the placental villi) did not change with gestation but enzyme activity and affinity did. Greater activify but lower affinity of UGT and CYPIA were observed in first trimester placentas than at term. In contrast, &#946;-glucuronidase had a high affinity, low activity profile in early gestation but the opposite at term. UGT and CYPIA activities in the first trimester placenta were induced by maternal cigarette smoking and may be synergistically induced by combined alcohol consumption and smoking. A significant correlation with higher UGT activity and earlier gestational age was observed. CYPIA exhibited a significant, negative correlation with maternal age across gestation. Maternal variables had no effect on &#946;-glucuronidase and their effects on the activity of CYP2EI and CYP reductase were not established. AZT caused apoptosis in the placenta and also increased reactive oxygen species and altered XME. The absence of serum enhanced these effects. Alterations in XME expression and activities included a decrease in UGT activity and increases in CYPIA, &#946;-glucuronidase, CYP reductase and glutathione-&#1029;-transferase activity in response to AZT exposure. AZT transport in a perfusion model was bi-directional and reached equilibrium approximately 3 h after addition of AZT into the maternal reservoir. In contrast, transfer of AZT glucuronide (AZT-G) showed significantly greater transport rates out of the fetal compartment resulting in AZT-G concentrations approximately 2-fold higher in the maternal circuit. Transfer of the co-factor UDPGA was significantly greater in the fetal direction and almost complete after 4h of perfusion. The low levels of glucuronidation of AZT catalysed by the human placenta (approximately 2% of a dose) are not due to insufficient transport of the co-factor UDPGA and are unlikely to be significant in terms of maternal whole-body clearance. Therapeutic failure of AZT in protecting the fetus is unlikely to be due to metabolism and clearance performed by the placenta but may be due to placental cytotoxicity. The development of the perfusion model into the first trimester placenta is technically achievable, but was impossible with the tissue available for these studies due to the method used to obtain placentas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320500 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Pharmacology)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3138</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Placing the lived experience(s) of TB in a refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Lawrence, Jody</field><field name="description">Although rates of tuberculosis (TB) in much of the western world have steadily declined since the Second World War, this infectious disease remains a leading cause of death among those living in impoverished circumstances. Social science perspectives have argued that TB is as much a reflection of socio-economic inequality and the uneven distribution of power and resources as it is about biological processes.  In this thesis I explore the lived experience of TB within the Somali refugee community in Auckland, New Zealand.  While migrants and refugees are frequently blamed for the resurgence in TB in Western countries, very little is known about the determinants that underlie this manifestation of the disease. The present research addresses this gap in the literature by employing a transdisciplinary social science approach that considers the determinants of health and illness that range across the social, cultural economic and political domains of human experience. The geographical underpinnings of the work are borne out in the fundamental goal: to (literally and metaphorically) place the lived experience of health, disease (and particularly TB) within the Somali refugee community in the wider context of migration and resettlement.  Employing qualitative methods I draw upon participants&#8217; narratives to highlight the different ways in which Somali health beliefs and experiences have been shaped by wider structural forces.  I demonstrate that within Auckland, Somalis encounter multiple and overlapping layers of disadvantage.  The combined impacts of this disadvantage have a profound influence on their health and illness experience, particularly in terms of the development and ongoing occurrence of TB.  Respondents with TB recounted widespread stigma that exacerbated the harm incurred by the illness itself.  Although Somalis are highly marginalised, the thesis acknowledges the agency and creativity exerted by people in fashioning the course of their life within the context of considerable structural constraints.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">tuberculosis</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">illness</field><field name="subject">migration</field><field name="subject">resettlement</field><field name="subject">Somalis</field><field name="subject">Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3151</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Angels at our tables: New Zealanders' experiences of hearing voices</field><field name="creator">Beavan, Vanessa</field><field name="description">The aim of this study was to explore the experience of hearing voices in the general New Zealand adult population. This included mapping the topography of voices and the impact of the experience on participants&#8217; lives, exploring participants&#8217; explanatory models, investigating coping strategies and support structures, and developing a model of the essence of hearing voices.  Quantitative and qualitative analyses of questionnaire (n=154) and interview (n=50) data revealed a great diversity of experiences, both within and among participants.  Of all topographical variables significantly related to emotional impact (content, form, duration, intrusiveness and control), voice content was the only significant predictor variable, accurately predicting the emotional response of 93.3% of participants. Overall, participants who valued their voice experiences tended to have spiritual beliefs, a more positive emotional reaction and less contact with mental health services.  In contrast, participants who experienced mostly unwanted voices tended to have biological and/or psychological understandings of their voice experiences, a more negative emotional reaction to them, and increased contact with mental health services.  Participants reported using a vast array of coping strategies, with varying degrees of success. Individualised techniques were reported to be the most effective, followed by setting aside a time to listen to the voices. In terms of help and support, participants called for a model of intervention that accepted their voice experiences as real, took an holistic approach incorporating contextual, cultural and spiritual factors, and worked with voice-hearers, their families and the public to provide information about voice phenomena and normalise the experience.  Using a phenomenological approach, a model of the essential structure of hearing voices is proposed, comprising five components: the content of the voices is personally meaningful to the voice-hearer; the voices have a characterised identity; the person has a relationship with their voices; the experience has a significant impact on the voice-hearer&#8217;s life; and the experience has a compelling sense of reality. The implications of this research include validating voice-hearers&#8217; perspectives of the experience, informing clinical work with voice-hearers, and informing the development of local and national-level services, such as a New Zealand Hearing Voices Network.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Auditory hallucinations</field><field name="subject">Voices</field><field name="subject">Psychosis</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring the relationship between family involvement and outcome in residential interventions for children</field><field name="creator">Woodfield, Melanie Joslyn</field><field name="description">Family participation in residential interventions for children has been reliably shown to enhance children&#8217;s adaptation to the community following discharge. This finding, however, had predominantly been observed in long-term residential programmes in North America. This thesis examines the influence of family involvement on outcome for children in a short-term residential intervention - the Children&#8217;s Health Camp, in Auckland, New Zealand. This service offers children and families, who may be experiencing social, emotional, physical and/or behavioural challenges, individualised interventions that often include a five-week residential stay. A &#8216;high family involvement&#8217; condition, a community-based programme that followed a residential intervention, was compared with a &#8216;low family involvement&#8217; condition (the traditional residential programme). No statistically significant differences were observed between the groups on parent-report measures of child behaviour and parenting practices, although significant improvements in children&#8217;s behaviour (including emotional, social and conduct aspects) for both groups were found. Reasons for the lack of difference between the groups, and the difficulties inherent in conducting outcome research in a residential facility for children are highlighted. Other influences on outcome for children and families, such as residential staff members&#8217; attitudes toward family involvement were also examined. The optimal conditions for successful short-term residential interventions for children are proposed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380107 Health, clinical and counselling psychology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Clinical Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of non-specific cellular defence mechanisms by cyclosporin A</field><field name="creator">Ormrod, Douglas James</field><field name="description">The immune response modifier Cyclosporin A (CsA) is widely used in the management of organ graft rejection and in the treatment of inflammatory disorders. CsA is a potent suppressor of T-lymphocyte function and it&#8217;s biological effects have been defined almost exclusively in these terms. However, recent studies in which the agent was shown to exacerbate a T-lymphocyte independent, experimentally induced bacterial infection of the kidney (pyelonephritis), indicated that CsA had effects on host defence mechanisms other than T-lymphocytes. The present study, using animal models, was undertaken to identify the host defence component modified by CsA. Neutrophils are a key component in the early response to infection and the administration of CsA resulted in an increase in the number of these cells in the circulation. When the effect of CsA on the in vitro metabolic activity of neutrophils and their ability to kill microorganisms was investigated, no changes were observed, but the in vivo ability of neutrophils to emigrate from the vasculature to a sterile inflammatory foci was markedly impaired. A model of localised subcutaneous infection was used to determine the effect of this CsA-associated suppression of neutrophil emigration on the ability of the host to mount a response to an infectious challenge. In CsA treated animals, neutrophil accumulation in E. coli infected, subcutaneously implanted sponges was initially suppressed, allowing bacterial numbers to increase rapidly. By 48 hours this powerful bacterial stimulus overrode the suppressive effects of CsA and led to a substantial increase in the size of the neutrophilic infiltrate. This finding of an initially reduced inflammatory response, followed by an increase in the influx of inflammatory cells, provided a possible explanation for the earlier observation that CsA promoted infection and tissue damage in experimental pyelonephritis. The relationship between the effect of CsA on neutrophil emigration and the pathogenesis of experimental pyelonephritis was therefore investigated. When CsA was administered to animals prior to inducing pyelonephritis, the neutrophilic infiltrate was markedly suppressed in the early stages. As predicted, this led to a logarithmic increase in bacterial numbers, the infiltration of large numbers of neutrophils and, ultimately, an exacerbation of tissue damage. Further studies, examining the effects of CsA on neutrophil-mediated inflammatory mechanisms, identified impaired neutrophil-to-endothelial cell adhesion as the most likely explanation for the observed defect in host defences. The integrated nature of cellular defence mechanisms in infectious disease is highlighted by these investigations. when microorganisms invade tissue, even though the number and function of circulating leucocytes may be normal their effective participation in the host response to infection depends on the ability to emigrate from the blood vessels to the site of infection. In summary, the discovery of additional properties of CsA provide an explanation for the patterns of infectious disease in patients treated with CsA, in whom infection with extracellular pathogens is common. It also seems likely that the ability of CsA to suppress neutrophil emigration may contribute to the effectiveness of the agent in the management of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis and psoriasis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Medicine)--University of Auckland, 1990.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the mechanisms of resistance of non-cycling cells to amsacrine and related antitumour drugs</field><field name="creator">Robbie, Maxine Ann</field><field name="description">Several studies have shown that non-cycling cells are resistant to the cytotoxic effects induced by amsacrine (m-AMSA; 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide). This resistance may limit the activity of m-AMSA and related 9-anilinoacridine antitumour agents against solid tumours. The biochemical mechanism(s) for this resistance have been investigated using spontaneously transformed Chinese hamster fibroblast (AA8 cells) in log- and plateau-phase spinner cultures. In early plateau phase most cells entered a growth-arrested state with a G1-G0 DNA content and showed a marked decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxicity after a 1-h exposure to m-AMSA or its solid tumour-active analogue, CI-921. Studies with radiolabelled m-AMSA demonstrated that changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced cell killing were not due to a difference in uptake or retention of drug by log- and plateau-phase cells, and there was no significant metabolism of drug by either log- or plateau-phase cells. Thus, after a 1-h exposure to [3H]-m-AMSA at 37&#176;C, a small proportion (1%) of cell-associated radioactivity was covalently bound to macromolecules, but most of the cell-associated radioactivity represented unchanged m-AMSA. There was no evidence for any oxidative metabolism to reactive quinoidal species in these tumour cells. However, studies with a fluorescence assay for DNA unwinding indicated that plateau-phase cells were 3 to 4 times less sensitive to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage than log-phase cells, and changes in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA breakage correlated with changes in sensitivity to cell killing by m-AMSA as cell progressed from log to plateau phase. Further studies showed that the decrease in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA stand breakage correlated with a decrease in sensitivity to covalent DNA-protein complex formation in plateau-phase cells after m-AMSA treatment. Combined with evidence that the DNA lesions rapidly disappeared from both log- and plateau-phase cells following the removal of m-AMSA (half-time approx. 4 min), this indicated that the lesions detected by the FADU assay probably arose from the stimulation of DNA-topoisomerase II (topo II) cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA. K+/SDS precipitation assays with [32p] 3&#8217;-end-labelled pBR322 DNA indicated that nuclear extracts containing topo II activity from plateau-phase cells were 3- to 4-fold less sensitive to stimulation of DNA-topo II complex formation by m-AMSA than nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. This change in sensitivity to m-AMSA-induced DNA-topo II complex formation was therefore similar to that observed with intact cells. However, P4 unknotting assays indicated that topo II activity in nuclear extracts from plateau-phase cells was only 2-fold lower than that in nuclear extracts from log-phase cells. Resistance to treatment with m-AMSA may therefore reflect a decrease in topo II activity and/or a decrease in sensitivity of topo II enzymes to stimulation of cleavable complex formation by m-AMSA in non-cycling cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321020 Pathology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Pathology)--University of Auckland, 1988.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Systems approach to a comprehensive community project: a study in community psychology</field><field name="creator">Seymour, Frederick William</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the concepts and methods of community psychology, and. applies them to what is called here a &#8220;comprehensive community project&#8221;. This is a project that undertakes to meet the needs of a community by fostering and strengthening the community&#8217;s own resources. The objectives of the research were : (1) to establish a comprehensive community project in the Auckland. suburbs of Birkdale and Beachhaven, and (2) to propose and. test a model for project organization and evaluation. The model was derived. from the systems approach to programme evaluation which provides a reasoned and. logical approach to all aspects of programme management. The model proposed involved systematic steps from initial programme planning to outcome measurement. The steps are, specifying the "system&#8221; or particular project, forming the values from which interventions would be derived, assessing needs and. resources, setting annual goals for activities from the foregoing steps, allocating available resources to activities, implementing and. reviewing activities, measuring outcome after one year, and feedback of this information for project improvement. Application of the model to the &#8220;Birkdale Project&#8221; showed that the model was relevant to management needs, and. Information yielded by application of the model was used. in day-to-day decision making. Thus the model was instrumental in establishing the Birkdale Project, and. in producing the vigorous project that resulted. in the first year a wide range of activities involving a significant portion of the population were provided. to meet community needs, and almost all the Project&#8217;s annual goals were attained. Although the project was established largely by paid professionally trained people, at the end. of the research period. the project was managed and run by non-professional residents. It was concluded. that the systems approach is highly appropriate to the development of comprehensive community projects, and has general advantages to the wider field of community psychology as a method for practice and research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321000 Clinical Sciences::321021 Psychiatry</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychiatry)--University of Auckland, 1978.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Input-specificity of sensory-induced neural plasticity in humans</field><field name="creator">McNair, Nicolas A.</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to investigate the input-specificity of sensory-induced plasticity in humans. This was achieved by varying the characteristics of sine gratings so that they selectively targeted distinct populations of neurons in the visual cortex. In Experiments 1-3, specificity was investigated with electroencephalography using horizontally- and vertically-oriented sine gratings (Experiment 1) or gratings of differing spatial frequency (Experiments 2 &amp; 3). Increases in the N1b potential were observed only for sine gratings that were the same in orientation or spatial frequency as that used as the tetanus, suggesting that the potentiation is specific to the visual pathways stimulated during the induction of the tetanus. However, the increase in the amplitude of the N1b in Experiment 1 was not maintained when tested again at 50 minutes post-tetanus. This may have been due to depotentiation caused by the temporal frequency of stimulus presentation in the first post-tetanus block. To try to circumvent this potential confound, immediate and maintained (tested 30 minutes post-tetanus) spatial-frequency-specific potentiation were tested separately in Experiments 2 and 3, respectively. Experiment 3 demonstrated that the increased N1b was maintained for up to half an hour post-tetanus. In addition, the findings from Experiment 1, as well as the pattern of results from Experiments 2 and 3, indicate that the potentiation must be occurring in the visual cortex rather than further upstream at the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Experiment 4 functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to more accurately localise where these plastic changes were taking place using sine gratings of differing spatial frequency. A small, focal post-tetanic increase in the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response was observed for the tetanised grating in the right temporo-parieto-occipital junction. For the non-tetanised grating, decreases in BOLD were found in the primary visual cortex and bilaterally in the cuneus and pre-cuneus. These decreases may have been due to inhibitory interconnections between neurons tuned to different spatial frequencies. These data indicate that tetanic sensory stimulation selectively targets and potentiates specific populations of neurons in the visual cortex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Neural Plasticity</field><field name="subject">LTP</field><field name="subject">Visual Cortex</field><field name="subject">Sensory Stimulation</field><field name="subject">Spatial Frequency</field><field name="subject">Orientation</field><field name="subject">EEG</field><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences::380100 Psychology::380103 Biological psychology (neuropsychology, psychopharmacology, physiological psychology)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::380000 Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2008.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of EEG biofeedback for the remediation of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder</field><field name="creator">Heywood, Charles Edward</field><field name="description">Seven boys between the ages of 7 and 12 with Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), some also with Specific Learning Disabilities (LD) and/or elevated aggression scales on the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL), were involved in this study of the effectiveness of EEG Biofeedback for the remediation of ADHD. A multiple-baseline design with an embedded ABAB component was used to compare baseline, 12-15 Hz Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) EEG Biofeedback (&#8220;active&#8221;) and single-blind sham feedback (&#8220;placebo&#8221;) conditions. Seven dependent variables including the ADHD Rating Scale, Child Attention Profile, Children's Checking Task, Controlled Oral Word Fluency Test, paired associate learning and continuous performance tasks were combined as z-scores into a single composite repeated measure. Visual and multiple baseline analyses were inconclusive. The primary analysis was by randomisation test with statistical control for overall trend. Randomisation test results were combined across five subjects (two subjects having failed to complete the study) using techniques for combining independent probabilities; for the combined group the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.02) with the active conditions displaying the more improved scores. An examination of effect sizes by subject and condition showed that the placebo vs. active contrast was significant (p &lt; 0.05, based on the confidence intervals for effect estimates) with a large effect size if trend was ignored and the two &#8220;drop-outs&#8221; were excluded but non-significant with a small effect size if overall trend was controlled, and the two drop-outs included. Effect sizes calculated pre-post were medium on average, and Reliable Change Indices for CBCL parent rated attention were significant for five subjects (p &lt; 0.001). There was no improvement in academic performance as assessed by pre-post Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised. There was no significant effect of condition on EEG Theta/SMR ratio, although there were some significant correlations with individual dependent variables. Four of six children continued to improve on the composite score from the end of the study to six-month follow-up. Results were discussed in light of non-specific treatment effects such as tacit behavioural training, Fried's respiration hypothesis, the cognitive energetic model of attention and confounds due to trend and subject mortality. It was concluded that EEG biofeedback appears to have beneficial effects on ADHD symptoms but these are due largely to non-specific treatment factors and confounds such as regression to the mean.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGICAL (0989)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/33</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A broad application optimisation-based rostering model</field><field name="creator">Nielsen, David</field><field name="description">This work considers the automated generation of high quality rosters for the general rostering situation.

Typically the condition is a consequence of disease of the circulatory system, and can cause considerable disability. The Auckland leg ulcer study is a community-based study of leg ulceration conducted in the North Auckland and Central Auckland health districts of New Zealand. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of leg ulcers in the community and investigate several possible risk factors for the condition. Cases were identified through notifications from health professionals and by self-notification. Cases aged between 40 and 99 years and on the electoral roll for the study region were invited to participate in a case-control study. Controls were individuals without leg ulcers and were selected from the electoral roll using a stratified random sampling process. Controls were also aged between 40 and 99 years and had to be resident within the study region to be eligible. Four hundred and twenty-six cases with current leg ulcers were identified during the 12-month study period, with 241 cases and 224 controls interviewed for the case-control study. Overall, the occurrence of leg ulcers in the general population was low, however, the prevalence and cumulative incidence increased dramatically with age, and changed according to gender and region. The average age at ulcer onset in interviewed cases was 65 years. Leg ulcers took approximately 12 months on average to heal, and recurrence occurred in 59% of cases. Treatment strategies were variable, and almost a quarter of all cases had been admitted to hospital within the last five years because of their ulcers. The average length of hospital stay was 34 days. Results from the case-control study indicated that deep vein thrombosis, lower limb surgery, leg fracture, and varicose veins were strong risk factors for the development of leg ulcers, Furthermore, nulligravida increased the risk of ulcer development while prolonged breast-feeding decreased risk, suggesting a hormonal component to the development of leg ulcers in women. These data have important implications for the prevention of this chronic condition.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Medicine)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the role of Customers and other external influencers in radical new product development &#8211; a network approach</field><field name="creator">Joseph, Richard</field><field name="description">The broad objective of this thesis is to extend our understanding of radical new product development (NPD) beyond degree of customer orientation (CO) by assessing the role and influence of both customers and other external influencers (OEIs). While a number of studies have investigated the relationship between CO and NPD outcomes, such studies typically focus on incremental NPD. The role of customers is also typically investigated using numerical scales to understand degree of CO, and fails to consider the important implementation issues of which, when and how customers are involved through the NPD process. In addition to customers, other external influencers (OEIs) such as investors, suppliers, distributors, competitors, universities and advisors are also increasingly involved in radical NPD, but the roles and actual influence of these different groups is unclear. To address these gaps in the literature this thesis adopts a network approach to investigate the role of customers and OEIs in the development of six radical new products. Six retrospective case studies are conducted, all involving the development of radical ICT products targeted at industrial markets. To provide further insight, three of these cases involve successful new products while the remaining three involve unsuccessful products. Analysis of case data involves qualitative and quantitative network analysis as well as thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Clear differences are found between the ways in which the successful and unsuccessful cases involve customers and OEIs. For example, firms developing successful products focus on existing customers with whom they have strong previous relationships, while developers of unsuccessful products do not. Furthermore, the successful cases all involve customers actively as co-developers of the product, while none of the unsuccessful cases take this approach. These findings are presented in detail and discussed in relation to the existing literature. A set of empirically-based propositions are outlined as a foundation for future research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">radical new product development (NPD)</field><field name="subject">customer orientation</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::350000 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 2008.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Parent-child relationships, peer functioning, and preschool hyperactivity</field><field name="creator">Keown, Louise June</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the parent-child relationships and peer functioning of community-identified, 4-year-old boys with hyperactive behaviour problems. The sample consisted of 33 pervasively hyperactive boys and 34 control children. Parenting and child behaviours, and family life factors were assessed at home using a range of measures including the Parental Account of Children's Symptoms Interview (PACS), the Parenting Scale, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and the Life Events Questionnaire. In addition, maternal directiveness and synchrony were coded from videotaped parent-child interaction during free play. Children's peer relations were assessed with teacher ratings on the Child Behavior Scale (CBS) and observer ratings of peer interactions at kindergarten.    Results showed that parents of hyperactive boys used less effective parenting skills in disciplinary situations and in coping with child behaviour problems, and spent less time in positive parent-child interaction than comparison group parents. Mothers of hyperactive boys also engaged in fewer synchronous play interactions with their sons and gave more negative ratings on indices of life stress. Poor parent coping, father-child communication, maternal synchrony, negative disciplinary practices, and life stress were significantly associated with hyperactivity after adjusting for the effects of conduct problems. The best parenting predictor of hyperactivity was maternal coping.    Compared with control children, the hyperactive boys received significantly higher ratings on exclusion by peers, aggressive, noncompliant, and non-social behaviours, as well as significantly lower ratings of prosocial behaviour and peer acceptance. These between-group differences in social functioning remained significant after statistical control for the effects of conduct problems. Further analysis suggested that the associations between hyperactivity and child social behaviours were partly or wholly explained by group differences in exposure to parenting behaviours that are important for children's social development.    These findings highlight the need to examine more closely the role of parenting behaviours in shaping the course, prognosis and treatment outcomes in relation to the behavioural and social adjustment of preschool hyperactive children. The implications of these findings for early childhood intervention in hyperactive behaviour problems are discussed.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, CLINICAL (0622)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/34</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interpreting references to the subject in philosophical writings</field><field name="creator">Nickless, David, M.A.</field><field name="description">In this thesis I will develop and test an interpretive framework for the Subject based on the understanding that an entity can be identified as a Subject if it is the necessary referent for an attribution.

Situated firmly within this area, this thesis challenges the dominance of the generalised and largely technologically deterministic narratives within the field by seeking to constitute such knowledge in a different way.  Geography provides a useful standpoint from which to challenge these narratives owing to its enduring engagement with time and space, concepts implicit in any discussion of ICTs effects.  Emerging work on code space, transurbanism and timespace are specifically used to negate the persistent dualistic treatment of time and space which is argued to be hampering geographic research in this field.  Methodologically drawing from a non representational style this thesis uses these emerging understandings to access the in between, a mental space of performance; which involves the process of drawing from tacit knowledge, cognitive perceptions of the spatial and temporal environment and emotions, in order to explore the conditions of possibility that individuals are becoming aware of through their interactions with ICTs.  Four empirical interventions are used to ground these emerging understandings into the reality of everyday encounters with ICTs in Auckland, New Zealand.  The first focuses on the role of local government in the development of Auckland&#8217;s ICT infrastructure, a complex and contingent process.  The second concentrates on the provision of a Real Time Passenger Information System at Auckland bus stops, exposing individuals to new timespaces while waiting for the bus.  The third considers students opinions of the e-learning mechanisms used in two first year geography courses.  The final intervention examines the role ICTs play in South Africans and South Koreans imagining, negotiation and mediation of the migration process to Auckland.  In conclusion, this thesis contributes to how geography constitutes knowledge about ICTs at three different levels.  Empirically, the four interventions contribute grounded findings to the debates in the geographic literature over interactions with ICTs.  Methodologically, the conditions of possibility institutional and individual actors are beginning to perceive through their encounters with ICTs are revealed as are the timespaces that may eventuate from these. Theoretically, to understand how the interactions between individuals and ICTs are performed this thesis demonstrates the need to interrogate the in between as a process, not just a gap or blank.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">information and communications technologies</field><field name="subject">time</field><field name="subject">space</field><field name="subject">geography</field><field name="subject">non representational theory</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370400 Human Geography</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/3456</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phenotypic characterisation of the tremor mutant and AAV mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer in the rat model of Canavan disease</field><field name="creator">McPhee, Scott William John</field><field name="description">The doctoral studies described in this thesis involve the phenotypic characterization of the tremor rat, an animal model of Canavan disease, and a proof of principle gene transfer study in this model. The phenotype of the tremor rat is examined at the genetic, molecular, cellular, neurochemical, physical and behavioural levels, and tremor mutants are described within the context of Canavan disease. Tremor mutants appear to share many phenotypes with both human patients and to the knock-out mouse model. The deletion of aspartoacylase results in a total loss of the capacity to metabolize N-acetyl-aspartate to acetate and aspartate in brain, leading to elevations in brain N-acetyl-aspartate levels, changes in cell and tissue morphology, and physical and behavioural deficits including mild akinesia and loss of normal motor coordination and balance. Parallel to this work was the development of a gene transfer approach to treat Canavan disease, involving Adeno-associated virus mediated delivery of aspartoacylase to the mammalian central nervous system. Gene transfer was undertaken in tremor rat mutants, and analysis was made of gene expression and function as well as the effect of aspartoacylase expression on improving the phenotypic deficits observed in mutant animals. Gene expression was observed at the RNA and protein level, with recombinant protein observed in cell soma and processes. Although not significant the data suggested a trend of decreased NAA levels after aspartoacylase transfer in comparison to animals injected with a vector encoding green fluorescent protein. Improvement was noted in the rotorod phenotype with mutant animals receiving aspartoacylase gene transfer performing better at tests of balance and coordinated locomotion than animals receiving a control vector. The study provided evidence that Adeno-associated virus mediated aspartoacylase gene transfer to the brain improves some of the deficits in tremor mutants, and supports the rationale of human gene transfer for Canavan disease.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE (0317)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, GENETICS (0369)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Molecular Medicine)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/35</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Criticizing and responding to criticism in a foreign language: A study of Vietnamese learners of English</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Minh Thi Thuy</field><field name="description">Interlanguage pragmatics research has contributed a great deal to our understanding of L2 pragmatic use but less to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development, although developmental issues are also its primary research goal. Additionally, previous studies have been confined to a rather small set of speech acts, under-researching such face-damaging acts as criticizing and responding to criticism even though these may be more challenging for L2 learners.    The present study examines pragmatic development in the use of criticizing and responding to criticism by a group of Vietnamese EFL learners with a view to shedding light on the pragmatic properties of these speech acts. IL data were collected from 12 high beginners, 12 intermediate learners, and 12 advanced learners, via a written questionnaire and role play, and analyzed with reference to L1 and L2 baseline data collected from 12 Vietnamese and 12 Australian NSs via the same methods. Metapragmatic data were collected via retrospective interview.    Four main findings are discussed. Firstly, the learners criticized and responded to criticism very differently from the NSs. This difference might have adversely affected how the learners negotiated their intentions expressed via speech act realizations. Secondly, there was little evidence of any proficiency effect on the learners' use of these two speech acts. This was probably because pragmatic development was limited by the EFL context, as the learners had had insufficient exposure to the target norms. Thirdly, there was evidence of pragmatic transfer in the learners' production. This transfer was affected by the learners' perception of L1-L2 proximity and assumption of L2 reasonableness. Finally, the retrospective interviews with learners suggested four main sources of influence on their pragmatic decision-making: insufficient L2 pragmatic knowledge, transfer of communication and learning, processing difficulty, and learning experience.    The present study lends support to a number of SLA theories, including Bialystoks' processing model and Meisel et al.'s complexification hypothesis. It found that the major challenge for learners in L2 pragmatic acquisition is to gain control over processing. It also found an acquisitional order of modality markers which was dependent upon their structural complexity and the processing demands involved in producing them.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, LINGUISTICS (0290)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Language Teaching)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/36</field></doc><doc><field name="title">When worlds collide: ICTs, English teachers and high-stakes assessment (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Coogan, Phil</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to ascertain the degree to which high-stakes assessment for qualifications, such as New Zealand's National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA), act as a barrier to secondary English teachers' use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) with their students. Although the focus is on high-stakes assessment for qualifications, other factors, which might also facilitate or hinder English teachers' use of ICTs, such as professional development and infrastructural, technical and access issues, are also considered.    The literature review summarises the factors which tend to constrain or encourage teachers' use of ICTs, with a special focus on the considerable constraint placed on secondary teachers by their role in preparing and assessing students for high-stakes qualifications. The literature review also highlights the lack of convincing research into the impact on learning of ICTs but reveals that, in the subject English, there is some evidence of a positive impact when appropriate ICTs are used by well trained teachers in appropriate contexts.    Key NCEA foundation and implementation documents and publicity, achievement standards and assessment activities were analysed to ascertain the degree of official endorsement for the use of ICTs in secondary schools and English programmes in particular. To gauge the perceptions of New Zealand English teachers about the constraints and encouragers of ICTs in their teaching, all NCEA level one English teachers were surveyed. This was followed by face-to-face and online focus groups in which trends revealed in the survey were explored.    Document analysis revealed considerable official optimism that the flexibility and internal assessment of the NCEA would enable teachers to make greater use of ICTs. The achievement standards and supporting assessment activities however, tend to situate ICTs at the margins of English programmes as optional extras which, if used at all, tend to support current practice. The focus groups confirmed survey findings that, although English teachers are significant users of ICTs in their personal and professional lives, although they believe in the educational advantages of ICTs and although they work in schools and departments which support the classroom use of ICTs, they face significant constraints which prevent them making as much use of ICTs as they would like in their teaching. Most significant among these constraints is pressure of course coverage and lack of class time (largely attributable to the need to prepare students for high-stakes assessments). Other constraints include lack of adequate access to ICTs and technical support, and lack of appropriate professional development and time to learn about ICTs.    Based on the literature review and research findings, recommendations are provided for schools, policy makers and researchers. Key among these is the need to acknowledge the profound influence of high-stakes qualifications on secondary schools and teachers and evolve such qualifications to encourage and enable desired innovations. It is recommended that ICTs could be infused into English and eventually, inter-disciplinary programmes, through the creation of innovative, ICT infused achievement standards which could be combined into flexibly structured courses which better meet the needs of twenty first century students. Also recommended are approaches which enable greater access to ICTs for English teachers and methods of professional development which have proved effective with adult learners.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY (0710)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE (0279)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS (0288)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/37</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Computing exact approximations of a Chaitin omega number</field><field name="creator">Shu, Chi-Kou</field><field name="description">A Chaitin Omega number, &#937;, is the halting probability of a universal Chaitin (self-delimiting Turing) machine. Every &#937; number is both  computably enumerable and random. In particular, every &#937; number is non-computable. In this thesis, we describe a method to compute the exact values of the first 64 successive bits of a natural  Chaitin Omega number.    We first describe a model of computation which has been defined and proved to be a universal Chaitin machine U. We then propose a method (procedure) which combines iterative executions of an algorithm with mathematical analysis to get the exact values of the first successive 64 bits of the corresponding Chaitin &#937;U number of U.    This particular defined Chaitin machine U is essentially a register machine and has been implemented in Java. We call it the canonical compressed model (or compressed model) as it allows only &#8216;canonical&#8217; program strings to be processed in U. Thus, many input strings which are illegal, hence useless, are ignored and never involved in the computational process. In addition, the compressed design shortens the length of all instructions so that relatively short strings now contain somewhat complex programs.    A simulator for U, written in Java, is a primary part of the project. The algorithm is executed iteratively, computing step by step an increasing sequence of rational numbers (in binary) to approximate &#937; U. In the n-th step, the algorithm produces four main output files: all halting strings, looping strings, run-time errors, and prefix strings (incomplete programs). In each step, all prefix strings (of the previous step) are read and processed one by one. Each string is extended by 7 bits (ASCII code representations for symbols) to generate new strings that are examined one by one to detect any lexical, syntactic, semantic, or run-time error in each of them. Any of those strings with an error detected is discarded to save storage space and execution time.    We solve the Halting Problem for all programs for U of length less than or equal to 84 bits so we can calculate an increasing sequence of exact approximations converging to &#937;U. By means of a mathematical analysis the first successive 64 bits, 0000001000000100000110001000011010001111110010111011101000010000 of the 84 bits are proved to be the exact first bits of &#937;U. Actually, more bits can be obtained by this procedure if the disk space is sufficient for it to go on, but this procedure cannot be extended indefinitely.    In order to assure that our computing result is correct, we have proved that all input strings of length less than or equal to 84 executed in  U over 100 steps are not halting programs.*   *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

Erosion-corrosion is a generalised wear phenomenon where the combined effect of each degradation mechanism generates more extensive mass loss than the sum of each mechanism acting independently. Previous research has highlighted several theoretical mechanisms under this generalized process, ranging from the erosion induced breakdown of oxide scales in corrosive environments, through to the development of oxide layers in highly erosive environments. Prior to this current work experimental simulation of these mechanisms has focused on bulk alloy materials with well characterised oxidation responses, under conditions of low temperature, low erodent impact velocity and high erodent flux, conditions which are readily generated within laboratory scale rigs and which tend towards the low impact energy conditions encountered within fluidised bed combustors. Few works have addressed erosion-corrosion under simulated turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent impact velocity and low erodent flux. While comparative trials have been run under such conditions on a purely mass loss basis, little has been presented regarding the microstructural analysis of such degradation, particularly for materials that rely on the industrially relevant, slow growing oxide scales Cr2O3 and Al2O3.  Thermally sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings are routinely applied to combat wear at high temperature due to the high wear resistance imparted by the hard carbide particles and the high temperature oxidation resistant nature of the Cr2O3 oxide formed over both phases. However, most published work characterising the erosion-corrosion response of these coatings has been conducted on a comparative basis by contrasting coatings of various composition ratios, deposited by various techniques, with the response of well characterised bulk materials. Little has been presented on the microstructural mechanism of erosioncorrosion of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings, a point highlighted by the limited understanding of the oxidation mechanism of the Cr3C2 phase, the oxidation mechanisms of the combined composite Cr3C2-NiCr and the influence of the coating splat structure on the oxidation response. While the erosion response of thermal spray coatings and bulk cermets is more widely understood, most works have been conducted under milder conditions than used in the current work. In addition previous works have been conducted primarily on assprayed coatings with few works taking into account the effect of heat treatment induced changes in the coating composition and microstructure that occur with extended in-service exposure at elevated temperature.  In addressing the short comings in the current state of knowledge, the aim of this work was to characterise the mechanism of erosion-corrosion of high velocity sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr thermal spray coatings under turbine conditions, incorporating the effect of variation in the composition and carbide distribution with inflight degradation, variations in starting powder morphology, heat treatment, erosion conditions and exposure temperature.  75 Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr) coatings were deposited by Aerospray HVAF, GMA Microjet HVOF, Stellite Jet Kote HVOF and TAFA JP-5000 HVOF spraying under optimised conditions using agglomerated/sintered and blended powders. The prealloyed powder based coatings, characterised in terms of microhardness, porosity content and phase degradation, were found to exceed the average values of coating quality presented in the literature. The blended powder based coating of this work was comparable with the coating attributes presented in the literature for plasma and HVOF coatings based on this powder morphology. Based on these results the coatings were considered representative of those sprayed industrially and therefore the responses of the samples in this work to oxidation and erosion were considered indicative of the response of industrially applied coatings of this composition in service.  Heat treatment trials were conducted on the Aerospray HVAF and Microjet HVOF coatings at 900&#186;C in air and argon for up to 60 days to simulate the compositional and microstructural development of these coatings under elevated temperature conditions in service. In the prealloyed powder based coatings, rapid carbide precipitation occurred within the first two days in both coatings to reach the steady state composition of 75-80vol%. Minimal in-flight carbide dissolution in the HVAF coating led to preferential carbide precipitation on the retained carbide grains. In the Microjet HVOF coatings, which suffered extensive inflight carbide dissolution, carbide precipitation occurred as fine precipitates in the carbide-free zones, forming large sponge-like agglomerates. With extended exposure Ostwald ripening led to coarsening of the individual carbide grain size and widespread agglomeration of the carbide grains into an extensive three dimensional network after 30 days exposure, with minimal development out to 60 days. Compositionally, heat treatment led to a dramatic reduction in the supersaturated matrix phase Cr content, with the steady state Cr composition of the Microjet HVOF coating exceeding that of the Aerospray HVAF coating based on XRD analysis. Cr3C2 was the only carbide detected with heat treatment. Heat treatment of the blended powder based coating led to sintering of the single phase splats. Diffusion of the carbide elements into the matrix phase splats occurred, allowing fingers and nodules of the carbide to develop into this phase as well as increasing the matrix phase Cr concentration.  Oxidation of Cr3C2 by hot stage XRD analysis at 600&#186;C, combined with TGA analysis at 600-850&#186;C, supported the mechanism of stepwise decarburisation prior to Cr2O3 formation, presented as one possible mechanism in the literature. Oxidation of the Cr3C2-NiCr coatings over the range 700-850&#186;C was dependent on the starting powder morphology and the extent of dissolved carbide in the matrix phase. Oxidation of the as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings was dictated by the matrix phase, the high Cr concentration resulting from carbide dissolution leading to rapid growth of the Cr2O3 phase over the oxidising carbide grains. Growth stresses induced by such overgrowth lead to the formation of interfacial voids over the carbide grains at high temperature. Heat treatment reduced the matrix phase Cr concentration, resulting in the coating phases oxidising independently with a reduced magnitude of lateral matrix based scale growth over the carbide phase. In the blended powder based coating, bulbous Ni oxides dominated the scale topography. With extended exposure a continuous Cr2O3 scale formed below the faster growing Ni oxides, which enabled lateral growth of the scale over the carbide based Cr2O3 scales. Following heat treatment the matrix phase Cr concentration increased, minimising the development of Ni oxides on this phase.  Erosion studies were carried out in a custom built high temperature erosion apparatus. Ambient temperature trials were conducted using Al2O3 erodent at velocities of 150m/s. The as-sprayed prealloyed powder based coatings exhibited a brittle impact response, which was accentuated in the Microjet HVOF coating by the increased extent of in-flight carbide dissolution and the splat structure which made this sample more susceptible to brittle erosion mechanisms. Heat treatment of these coatings led to sintering of the splats and a more ductile impact response due to the increased ductility of the matrix phase. The as-sprayed blended powder based coatings exhibited a range of impact responses from brittle erosion of the carbide through to ductile erosion of the matrix based splats. Mass loss was accentuated by the poor intersplat adhesive strength. Heat treatment led to sintering of the splats, resulting in a more microstructural based erosion response.  The two prealloyed powder based coatings generated similar erosion rates under the aggressive conditions, distinctly more erosion resistant than the blended powder based coatings. Heat treatment improved the erosion resistance of all the coatings, however, the duration of heat treatment had a negligible effect on the magnitude of erosive mass loss.  Erosion at 800&#186;C, with an impact velocity of 235m/s, lead to significantly deeper erodent penetration into the coating than noted at ambient temperature. The significant increase in the matrix phase ductility at elevated temperature minimized the impact of carbide dissolution on the matrix impact response in the prealloyed powder based coatings. The primary effect of carbide dissolution was to reduce the carbide concentration, allowing deformation of the matrix to dictate the coating response. Carbide development with heat treatment significantly reduced the ability of the matrix to deform in this manner. The increased matrix phase ductility in the blended powder based coating reduced the concentration of impact energy on the splat boundaries, leading to a more microstructural based erosion response. Heat treatment had a negligible effect on the coating response, given the reduced significance of the splat boundary adhesion.  Erosion at 700&#186;C generated similar erosion responses in the prealloyed powder based coatings to those noted at 800&#186;C, the lower matrix phase ductility reflected in the more brittle response evident as brittle cracking and fracture. The effect of carbide development with heat treatment was not as dramatic as at 800&#186;C due to the reduced matrix phase ductility at this temperature. Erosion of the blended powder based coating at 700&#186;C generated the same spectrum of erosion response as noted at 800&#186;C in both the as-sprayed and heat treated states, with the variation in matrix phase ductility with temperature overshadowed by the heterogeneous coating impact response resulting from the heterogeneous phase distribution.  The steady state erosion rate at 700&#186;C was comparable across all of the coatings in both the as-sprayed and heat treated conditions. At 800&#186;C, heat treatment had a negative impact on the prealloyed powder based coatings, but no definitive effect on the blended powder based coatings. The Microjet HVOF coatings were more erosion resistant than the Aerospray HVAF coatings under these conditions. These results pointed to a reduction in the significance of the coating splat structure on the magnitude of erosion, in favour of a more microstructural based response at high temperature.  In both the ambient and elevated temperature trials the coating microhardness values proved to be a poor indicator in predicting the magnitude or relative ranking of the erosion response of the different coatings under these aggressive erosion conditions.  Erosion-corrosion under turbine conditions of high temperature, high erodent velocity and low erodent flux, was simulated by oxidizing samples at 900&#186;C and subjecting them to one second of erosion every 48 hours over a period of 60 days. The degradation testing was assessed in accelerated testing in additional trials by polishing the oxide scale formed at 900&#186;C from the sample surface every 48 hours over the same time period. Under these conditions the coatings formed thick oxide scales that penetrated into the coating. Preferential internal oxidation of the Cr3C2 phase occurred in the coating, consuming the grains in the near surface zone through the formation of Cr2O3 to a depth dependent upon the test temperature. Oxygen ingress occurred along the carbide-matrix interface and was accentuated in the regions of impact damage surrounding the erodent indentations. Internal oxidation of the carbide phase sealed off the pockets of matrix phase which were eventually consumed by oxidation once they were no longer able to maintain a protective Cr2O3 oxide. The extent of internal attack was consistent in the 20, 40 and 60 day samples, suggesting that the internal oxidation front proceeded at a constant rate in front of the erosion front into the coating. The prealloyed powder based coatings were more resistant to such internal degradation relative to the blended powder based coatings, with an internally oxidised zone of 6&#236;m relative to the 10&#236;m thick internally oxidized band in the blended powder based coating. While each erodent impact event may be classified as oxidation affected erosion, the low erodent flux effectively led to a long-term response more accurately described as erosion affected oxidation.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Engineering, General (0537)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemical and Materials Engineering)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/39</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Quest for Avirulence Factors in Venturia inaequalis</field><field name="creator">Win, Joe</field><field name="description">The molecular basis for the gene-for-gene relationship of Vm-resistance in apple to Venturia inaequalis was investigated. Incompatible reactions involved a hypersensitive response (HR), which was accompanied by the accumulation of dark brown pigments and autofluorescent materials in epidermal and mesophyll cells at the site of invasion. Cell-free culture filtrates of the avirulent isolate elicited an HR in the Vm host (h5) leaves, but not in the susceptible host (h1). The elicitor activity was resistant to boiling but was abolished by proteinase K digestion. Elicitation of HR was used to monitor purification of the avirulence factor, AVRVm, from liquid cultures of the avirulent isolate following ultrafiltration, acetone precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography. The purest fraction contained three major proteins all with low isoelectric points (pI 3.0-4.5). The fraction also elicited HR on the differential host h4, but not on other resistant hosts (h2, h3 and h6) tested. Three candidate AVRVm proteins were identified and amino acid sequences were obtained using Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Nucleotide sequences corresponding to these proteins were found in databases of V. inaequalis expressed sequence tags. There were no polymorphisms evident between avirulent and virulent isolates (representing races 1 and 5 respectively) either at genomic DNA or cDNA level of the full open reading frames. RT-PCR revealed that all genes were expressed in both avirulent and virulent isolates during in vitro and in planta growth. All three genes showed similar levels of expression between avirulent and virulent isolates during their in vitro growth. However, preliminary RT-PCR experiments showed that two of these genes were likely to be expressed at lower levels in the virulent compared with the avirulent isolate during compatible infection.

Such is the aim of this thesis: to discover the 'real man' behind the statistics about sex-roles and the predominance of male characters in children's and adolescents' literature. From within a selection of Spanish texts a variety of male characters are analysed, focusing on six major roles: father, grandfather, imaginary friend, detective, outlaw or similar marginalised man, and foreign other, with particular attention paid to the Gypsy.    All the chapters are linked by the Bakhtinian theory that dialogue with the other leads to the development of a character's or potential reader's sense of identity. The first chapter, concerning fatherhood, is related to a person's sense of intrinsic identity, given with their name and genetic heritage. The grandfather represents a similar sense of family continuity, as well as enabling the young reader to understand Spain's recent historical and rural past. An imaginary friend may symbolise an aspect of identity concerned with a child's ability to achieve a goal or to occupy a special place within the family. Detective stories are analogous to the young person's developing identity as a reader able to decipher the mysteries of texts, whilst marginalised men typify children themselves: persons who have neither status nor money, but who are able to indulge in carnivalistic behaviour which adults call 'play.' The development of one's sense of national identity is fomented through interaction with texts about foreigners who have contributed to Spain's growth as a nation from pre-historic times to the present.    A brief critical evaluation of the role of women in detective fiction and as marginalised figures is offered by way of contrast in the appropriate chapters. The thesis concludes that, when analysed as individuals, many male characters demonstrate traits not traditionally considered masculine, and that it is necessary to look beyond mere representations of gender in judging the value of characters in literature for children and adolescents.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">LITERATURE, ROMANCE (0313)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, READING (0535)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420303 Culture, gender, sexuality</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Spanish)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Technological law :  societal control of technology and the potential of the world standards movement</field><field name="creator">Hitchcock, Edward</field><field name="description">Over the last three centuries the rapidly increasing influence of technology has come to dominate every aspect of human life. Progressive realization of adverse effects has led to increasing demand for and imposition of control measures. The concept of common law embodied in legal tradition have been found inadequate, and forced a change to "enacted law". The regulatory explosion necessitated delegation from legislative to executive agencies.The resulting techniques of control developed in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States are examined. One common factor stands out, the extensive dependence of law-making bodies on independent technical specification material from non-government sources, and the confused, conflicting, and inconsistent methods of utilizing those specifications in law-making. Most of this independent material comes from Standards bodies. Their basic concept, the establishing of acceptable practice by prior agreement, is outlined, and the growth of the movement traced from the original development in Britain to a World-wide movement. Their processes of consultation and consensus represent a practical democratic system of self regulation. Studies of these aspects are rare, but a number of those relevant are reviewed, ranging from the Robens committee in Britain, through Building Code Reform in New Zealand, to a whole series of very recent reports from the United States, including a Presidential Task Force, an attempt to establish a National Standards Policy, a Federally commissioned study by a Professor of Law, and a Presidential Executive Order.From these emerge the pattern of complaint: Regulatory control is excessive, rigid, and liable to cause economic waste. It tends to be ineffective, and fails to achieve primary aims. As technology development exposes society to greater risks, efficiency becomes more vital, and failure to achieve control a serious danger. Problems arise from the failure of traditional legal approaches to adapt to the newer challenge of technology, particularly the legal acceptance of law "as it is" without recognition that the task calls for developing the law-making process to meet the needs of the changed situation. It is contended that many of the problems in regulatory control of technology come from the practice of making technical specification material direct legal command. The various reports reviewed comment on the limitations inherent in negative legislative control, the irrelevance of litigation, Court action and punishment, to the fundamental problem of achieving successful control. There is need for the encouragement of self regulation, and establishment of appropriate links with law.The special characteristics and responsibilities of law controlling technology are brought out, and call for identification as a separate branch of law: "Technological Law". Such law, it is contended, needs to make optimum usage of (a) the factors that have contributed to the dominance of technology, including the scientific approach, and the practice of prior agreement and (b) the essential components of democratic society, including participation, consensus, decentralized control, and self regulation associated with a formal method of determining acceptability.Practical proposals are developed involving the recognition of the practice of legislating by reference to independent technical specifications the encouragement of self-regulation processes through statutory backing, and their linking by recognition of the dyad in law, a separation of fundamental aims and principles appropriate to law from the means of meeting these aims.There is detailed examination of the three themes of reform. Techniques of the reference process, the legal objections, and the range of practices are examined, and acceptable technique suggested. The significance and importance of self-regulation is examined, and the contribution of "Standards" developed. A detailed examination is made of the various examples of two part law found in legislation, or in the studies reviewed. The framing of law in terms of general requirements is considered in relation to the problem of certainty and the idealization of the performance concept. The prerogative of the law-maker to designate certain practices as complying with general requirements is established as fundamental. The objection that this is a function of interpretation which lies exclusively with the Courts is discussed and the principle advanced that the vital Court function should never be called into the routine observance area.Technological law has as its essential aim the achievement of observance. Punishment, and court action is indication of failure. The emphasis must be on understanding and facilitating compliance. The second part of the dyad calls for sets of interrelated, interdependent specifications of acceptable practice, serving equally differing specialized laws, technical practices, commercial practices and education, and clarifying in positive fashion that which complies with law. The existing, established mechanisms of the world Standards movement are seen as providing the sets of technical specifications to fulfill this second function. This industry-developed process of self regulation utilises the techniques of prior agreement and in practical form, the elusive concept of consensus.Studies have emphasised the superior ability of the system to call in technical resources and voluntary effort to the service of law-making, in comparison with the resources of a governmental agency. The desirable aim is partnership, and the utilization of substantial measures of voluntary compliance.The question of recognition and authority for Standards and their producing organizations is seen as essential, and criteria are developed from the examples reviewed, notably from the pioneer New Zealand Act of 1941.The study emphasizes the little recognised function of Standards organizations of identifying acceptable practice, providing what has become an essential component of the machinery of government of a modern state.The mechanism provides a basis of certainty for commercial operations, and, through the strength of consumer or purchaser choice, an effective method of control as an alternative to yet more complex regulatory activity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Mechanical (0548)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1979.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/40</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Therapy: it's a two-way thing": women survivors of child sexual abuse describe their therapy experiences</field><field name="creator">McGregor, Kim</field><field name="description">This thesis gives a voice to women who have been sexually abused and subsequently received therapy. It contributes to the scarce international literature on evaluations of therapy by women survivors of child sexual abuse (CSA). It is hoped that policies and clinical practices for survivors of CSA will be improved as a result of this research. The study was advertized in the general public to women survivors of CSA who were over the age of 20, who had had at least five therapy sessions but were not currently in therapy. One hundred and ninety-one women completed a postal questionnaire that included open and closed questions about their CSA and disclosure experiences and about what they found helpful and unhelpful in therapy. Twenty respondents took part in follow-up interviews of up to two hours. Themes from the questionnaires and the interviews were analysed using EpiInfo6 and the data management tool NVivo. The majority of participants (91%) experienced CSA to the level of genital contact, or attempted penetration or penetration. Participants took over 16 years on average to disclose the CSA. The majority of participants (86%) reported that, overall, therapy was either somewhat or very helpful. Participants who had over 50 sessions of therapy were significantly more likely to report improved emotional well-being compared with those who had 50 sessions or less. Obstacles to participants gaining sufficient therapy for their needs included the cost of therapy and/or a restricted number of therapy hours subsidized by ACC. Participants reported that helpful therapy included a supportive, interactive therapy relationship with a therapist who was knowledgeable about the dynamics and effects of CSA and of abuse-focused therapy. Acknowledgement, understanding, normalisation and assistance to talk about the CSA and work through the effects on their lives were valued. Unhelpful therapy included a therapy relationship where the therapist was not affectively available or knowledgeable about the dynamics and effects of CSA. Therapists who were unable to support participants to talk about the CSA and work through the effects on their lives were criticized. There were also a few examples of harmful practices. The limitations of the study are the lack of a control group, the fact that participants were self-selected and the retrospective nature of their reports. It was concluded that most therapists were doing an effective job in difficult circumstances. However, some therapists need to develop a more open therapeutic relationship that would allow clients to give feedback about the impact of the therapy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cross-cultural communication in a postmodern business environment: the role of French language and culture in New Zealand-French business relations</field><field name="creator">Speedy, Karin Elizabeth</field><field name="description">In international business, notions of homogeneity and standardisation are promoted as necessary parts of the globalisation process. &#8220;One world&#8221; is equated with &#8220;one language&#8221; and English, portrayed as the global lingua franca, is seen as the only language needed to operate successfully in world markets. Using Jean Baudrillard&#8217;s theory of the cyclic superposition of the singular, universal and global as a framework and applying it to the business communications between New Zealand exporters and their French buyers, this thesis questions the beliefs underpinning Anglophone reliance on English, and the value of this reliance, in a postmodern business environment. It first examines historical shifts in attitudes to and use of both dominant &#8220;universal&#8221; languages and individual &#8220;singular&#8221; languages and finds that tensions tend to arise when dominant powers try to impose, in an imperialistic fashion, their language on the &#8220;Other&#8221;. It argues that the universal ideals of unity and openness popularly associated with globalisation are myths expounded by Anglophone big business, which, as the advocate of English as the language of international commerce, fails to recognise the hegemonic implications of its discourse. Through both qualitative and quantitative field research, it reaches the conclusion that, aside from a lack of attention paid to foreign languages in business, international business writers offer outdated and often erroneous cross-cultural advice for doing business in France. This cultural guidance is tainted by both the universalist/structuralist frameworks employed by the writers as well as their own inherent cultural assumptions, and is found to be of little use to New Zealand business people. By reviewing previous research, the thesis determines that New Zealand business has demonstrated a slight shift in attitude toward foreign language use in recent years. The results of my survey, designed to gauge the present attitudes to and use of French among New Zealand exporters, show that while some firms have embraced the idea of using French in business, most are still reliant on English for day-to-day business communications with their French customers. In the view of the latter, however, this behaviour does not foster efficient and equitable business relations. For the French, a New Zealand exporter prepared to use French in the French market would have a competitive advantage. Set in the context of Baudrillard&#8217;s paradigm, the thesis demonstrates that within the New Zealand-French business relationship the perpetual struggle between local and dominant languages continues to be a critical issue that requires urgent redress.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--French)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Spirit of Christ and the postmodern city: Transformative revival among Auckland's Evangelicals and Pentecostals (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Grigg, Vivian Lawrence</field><field name="description">This study develops a missional theology for both process and goals of 'Citywide Transformative Revival.' This has been grounded in the local realities of Auckland as a representative modern/postmodern city.    Global discussion among urban missions strategists and theologians have provoked the question: 'What is the relationship of the Spirit of Christ to the transformation of a postmodern city?' This has been examined in a limited manner, using two local indicators: the New Zealand revival (for the work of the Holy Spirit) and Auckland city (for emergent modern/postmodern megacities). This has resulted in an exploration of  revival theology and its limitations among Auckland's Pentecostals and Evangelicals and a proposal for a theology of transformative revival that engages the postmodern city.    To accomplish this, a research framework is proposed within an evangelical perspective, a postmodern hermeneutic of 'transformational conversations ', an interfacing of faith community conversations and urban conversations.    This is used to develop a new theory of 'citywide transformative revival' as an expansion of revival theories, a field within pneumatology. Citywide transformative revival is a concept of synergistic revivals in multiple sectors of a mega-city. This results in long-term change of urban vision and values towards the principles of the Kingdom of God.    A theology of transformative process is developed from apostolic and prophetic themes. These are outcomes of gifts released in revival. Transformative revival results in new transformative apostolic and prophetic structures that engage the postmodern city soul.    Transformation implies goals. The results of revival, the transformative visions for the city, are developed from themes of the City of God and the Kingdom of God. I expand largely 'spiritual' Western formulations of the Kingdom to a holistic Kingdom vision of the spiritual, communal and material aspects of the postmodern city. These enable conversation spaces with modern urbanism and postmodernism.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, PUBLIC AND SOCIAL WELFARE (0630)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, GENERAL (0318)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Theology)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/41</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative girls: fashion design education and governmentality</field><field name="creator">Bill, Amanda Elizabeth</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with creativity as an object of educational governance and a category of subjective identification. It studies a &#8216;creativity explosion&#8217; in higher education in New Zealand, focusing on how fashion design students are being mobilized as subjects of creativity through &#8216;joined up&#8217; modes of governance and technologies of educational choice. Using a poststructural ethnographic &#8216;methodology&#8217; I explain how, from the late 1990s, models of educational governance began to appear dysfunctional and unable to deliver the attributes and capacities expected of citizens in a knowledge economy. I argue that creativity gained significance as a result of new ways of &#8216;thinking culture and economy together&#8217;. Neoliberal rhetorics representing creativity as flexible human capital and a generic, transferable skill needed by workers in the new economy, were articulated with liberal humanist notions about creativity, which are commonly understood and performed through the social categories of art. All kinds of individual and institutional actors took advantage of these shifting opportunity structures to position themselves with &#8216;creative&#8217; identities. Within various cultural organisations, including universities, moves to strengthen a liberal agenda and retain creativity as a form of &#8216;arts knowledge&#8217; with high cultural capital, rubbed up against counter-hegemonic strategies to enlist and develop more universal concepts about creativity as a collaborative endeavour, vital to new forms of capitalist enterprise. By historicising the context in which a new &#8216;normative doctrine&#8217; of creativity has emerged, and by treating its theorisation as culturally performative, I develop the position that fashion design graduates, as &#8216;creative girls&#8217;, are highly productive performers in the new categories of cultural economy. However I argue that the creative girl occupies a subject position fitted to after-neoliberalised social and economic arrangements, not because she is shaped by neoliberal ideologies, but because she is made up by techniques and tactics of an &#8216;after-neoliberal&#8217; governmentality. This demonstrates the mutual constitution of &#8216;creative economy&#8217; and &#8216;creative persons&#8217; and underlines the fact that despite after-neoliberal ambitions for managing education, there can be no simple cause and effect relation between higher education and economic performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">creativity research</field><field name="subject">creativity pedagogy</field><field name="subject">creative economy</field><field name="subject">sociology of design</field><field name="subject">gender studies</field><field name="subject">youth studies</field><field name="subject">governmental politics</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::220000 Social Sciences, Humanities and Arts-General</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::360000 Policy and Political Science</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::410000 The Arts</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Sociology and Women's Studies)--University of Auckland, 2008.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Clarifying leadership:  The role of the school principal as an educational leader</field><field name="creator">Thew, Laurie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of primary school principals as they undertake their role as educational leaders. Part One summarises theories about leadership and places principals' educational leadership in context. Leadership is defined as a social process whereby principals blend biography and context to reconcile positivist, systemic requirements and recommendations with appropriate localised, and individualised, expectations and aspirations.    Part Two outlines an ethnographic methodology that justifies a process to gather and analyse data on the work of three principal subjects. This material is presented in cameo form and supported by questionnaire data from a further group of principal colleagues. Principals' leadership is identified as the interpretation of expectations and resources that results in particular actions. This interpretation is sourced in both context and personal biography.    Part Three consists of data analysis and findings. The influence and interplay of context and personal biography are outlined. Conclusions are drawn as to the differences between leadership and management practices, and specific leadership activities performed by principals are identified. This leads to a clarification of leadership as a process of control (as opposed to power) that defines, rather than accommodates, the rules of realisation as to appropriate action. Recommendations are made regarding further study into the issues of personal identity, leadership style and the urgent need for principal pre-service and in-service professional development.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/43</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Mr Jones' wives':  World War II war brides of New Zealand servicemen</field><field name="creator">Fortune, Gabrielle Ann</field><field name="description">Frederick Jones, Minister of Defence during World War II, was responsible for the transportation to New Zealand of the foreign-born wives and fianc&#233;es of New Zealand servicemen. Between 1942 and 1948 servicemen returning from theatres of war in Europe, the Middle East and the Pacific brought over 3000 wives and 700 fianc&#233;es to New Zealand. Portrayed as homogeneous, young, working-class British housewives who made hasty ill-considered marriages, war brides, in fact, proved to be varied in origin, age, occupation and education. Whirlwind romances and short courtships were not the norm. This thesis examines the consequences of the decision to marry a New Zealander and migrate and the impact of the journey and settlement. The full glare of publicity that greeted war brides on arrival focused attention on their compatibility with, and adaptability to, the receiving society. Adjustment was however fraught with difficulties.    Memory and loss are implicit in the experience of migration. War brides expressed this in terms of the rift with their pasts and a lack of shared memories. On arrival in New Zealand war brides dispersed around the country in an extreme 'pepper-potting' pattern. When their only connection with New Zealand was their locally-born husband they suffered social isolation and sometimes a devastating sense of loneliness. The resulting marginalisation they experienced was evident in their oral history narratives. Ambivalence and recourse to serendipity as an explanation for past actions were elements of the dis-composure discernable in narratives.    In spite of their varied religious, social and class backgrounds, this diverse cohort formed a war bride identity based on shared experience rather than national or ethnic origin. Far from dissipating, their war-bride identity has been consolidated into an enduring image most tangibly expressed in the extant war brides' clubs, although club attendance is not a prerequisite of war bride identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, MODERN (0582)</field><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--History)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/44</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Species recognition in zebra finches: testing the effects of sex, sensory modalities, and social ontogeny</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Dana L.M.</field><field name="description">Species recognition is an integral component of mate selection and must occur in all sexually reproducing organisms to avoid costly hybridisation. Species recognition abilities may be comprised of both innate components and experience during ontogeny through the learning of visual, acoustic, and other sensory species-specific cues. But how greatly is the ability to recognise one&#8223;s own species (conspecifics) over others (heterospecifics) dependent on the phylogeographic relationship of the array of potential species as social partners and to what extent is the discriminatory behaviour modulated by subject ontogeny versus species identity? Using a model system, which is widely studied in all disciplines of avian research, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata castanotis), I aimed to investigate the visual and acoustic cues involved in conspecific recognition by both female and male individuals of this species. I used an array of previously untested phylogeographically relevant estrildid heterospecifics as my stimuli and tested subjects of diverse experimental ontogenetic treatments. By scoring a wide-selection of measured behavioural responses my research indicates that female and male zebra finches prefer live conspecifics over live phylogeographically relevant heterospecific stimuli and this preference is more consistent by females than males. Female zebra finches rely on both visual and acoustic features of potential social partners for accurate species discrimination; in this regard video playbacks or the diverse colour morphs of domesticated zebra finches may be useful tools for further experimentation. Additionally, females display significant individuality in their behavioural responses which may be relevant for pair bonding decisions made by both sexes. I further documented that normally-reared zebra finches will prefer song playbacks of their own species but that both rearing in an indoor restricted acoustic environment of conspecifics or cross-fostering to another species will reduce discrimination preferences, although the results may depend on the behavioural metrics analysed.

Little is known about the ethnic socialisation of internationally adopted children, raised in racially similar adoptive homes. Within the TRA literature, it has been found that transracially adopted children tend to ethnically identify with the white majority culture. That tendency has also been linked to adoptive parents' attitudes about the birth culture, and speculation that most parents are assimilating their children to the dominant culture. Research on TRA has also revealed that despite low ethnic identification, most adoptees score highly on indices of self-concept.    In the present study, 162 New Zealand adoptive families of European descent, with children adopted predominately from Eastern Europe, were surveyed concerning their experiences and attitudes about the importance of their children's birth culture. Results from the surveys showed that the majority of families engaged in a range of cultural activities, and made efforts to socialise with people of their child's birth ethnicity. In addition, most of the adoptive parents expressed a desire that their children ethnically identify with the birth culture, as well as with the New Zealand culture. Almost all of the families researched the birth country before travelling to collect their children, and most parents kept part or all of their child's original name.    A sub-sample of 52 of the adopted children was also interviewed in a second phase of the study. Measures of ethnic identity were obtained, using the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992), as were adjustment scores, using the Piers-Harris Children's Self-Concept Scale (Piers, 1984). Findings revealed that overall, the children had moderate identification with the birth culture, and moderate to high self-concept scores, which were not correlated with one another other.    From the parent surveys, a scale was derived to assess the parent's sensitivity to culture. Known as the 'Cultural Sensitivity Measure' (CSM), this score was statistically compared to the children's ethnic identity scores, to test the assumption that the parents' attitudes about the birth culture would influence the children's ethnic identification with the birth culture. While the parents had moderate sensitivity scores, no relationship was found between the parents CSM scores and the children's MEIM scores.    Overall, these findings suggest that the internationally adopted children in New Zealand are well adjusted, interested in their ethnic origins, and being parented by New Zealanders who support the children's interest in their birth culture. Future areas of research were identified, and recommendations to families, professionals and policymakers were offered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, DEVELOPMENTAL (0620)</field><field name="subject">SOCIAL WORK (0452)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/45</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women writing trauma : an analysis of psychological trauma in Ingeborg Bachmann's Das Buch Franza, Christa Wolf's Kassandra, Patricia Grace's Cousins, and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku's Ruahine - mythic women</field><field name="creator">Allport, Tanya</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to explore how women express psychological trauma through the writing of fiction. By analysing the historical context of what psychological trauma has meant to women, and how they have represented it, the thesis proposes a model which is based on the recurrent sources of trauma for women, the &#8216;triple trauma&#8217; of othering, violence, and voicelessness. By using cross-cultural examples from the writing of Austrian Ingeborg Bachmann, German writer Christa Wolf, and the New Zealand M&#257;ori writers Patricia Grace and Ngahuia Te Awekotuku, questions are asked about the similarities and differences of how psychological trauma is represented through fiction, and what this means for the female protagonists of the texts, the female writers, readers and the cultures and societies out of which these writings originate. In analysing these relations, this thesis finds that the fictional writing about the sources and experiences of trauma can expose a range of ideological connections, and that the writing and reading about these connections constitutes a valid trauma discourse. This trauma discourse supports the aim of contemporary feminist traumatology which is to make women&#8217;s trauma visible, give meaning to it, and ultimately create frameworks that promote the healing (and prevention) of trauma.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Comparative Literature)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The investment risk of institutional-grade commercial real estate in Australia</field><field name="creator">Schuck, Edward John</field><field name="description">Knowledge of the investment risk of investment-grade commercial real estate (&#8216;ICRE&#8217;) is important because it determines the approaches which should be taken to portfolio management. However, relatively little is known about this risk.    This research expands the body of knowledge of ICRE investment risk by producing conclusions about the information content of prices and the distribution of returns in the ICRE context. It is broken into three main parts.    First, the ICRE returns-generating process is characterised to form a basis for deducing theoretical conclusions about the information content of prices and the stochastic attributes of returns. The rationale for this approach lies in capital markets literature, which demonstrates that the characteristics of the information structure of markets, the decision-making processes of investors and the market trading mechanism determine the main attributes of the process of price evolution (which is assumed to be the main driver of returns). The analysis concludes that ICRE prices are partially informed, and changes in prices are described by a &#8216;jump&#8217; process.    Second, analysis of a database of &#8216;large&#8217; price changes supplied by the Property Council of Australia is undertaken to empirically test the jump process hypothesis. This analysis provides evidence that natural events associated with changes in the leasing structure of properties are a primary driver of relatively large, infrequent dislocations in valuation-based prices.    With parts one and two as a backdrop, the third part of this research empirically tests a discrete mixture of normals (&#8216;DMON&#8217;) model of investment risk. Capital markets research shows that a DMON model flows naturally from jump price processes. DMON models fitted to cross-sectional returns on individual properties supplied by the PCA are found to be superior to the normal and stable Paretian models previously proposed by other researchers.    In aggregate these conclusions have serious implications for the management of ICRE portfolios, and suggest a need for additional research. Some implications include: (1) Mean-lower partial variance is superior to mean-variance optimisation. (2) Forecasting the distribution of ICRE returns forms a new tool for active management. (3) Passive portfolio management is inappropriate. (4) Comparables-based valuations may be unreliable for investment decisions.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, FINANCE (0508)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Property)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/46</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language matters:  The politics of teaching immigrant adolescents school English (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Kepa, Tangiwai Mere Appleton</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to reflect upon the complex process of educating the sons and daughters of immigrant parents from diverse cultural communities. The study stresses the importance of valuing the language and culture of students in Aotearoa-New Zealand for whom English is another language. It is argued that the discourse of what shall be called &#8216;technocratic pedagogy&#8217; falls short of meeting this goal. What is needed is more expansive and inclusive programmes that apprehend the social, economic, and political contexts of learning. This is necessary if the students are to continue their education not simply to absorb prescribed information and ideas but to actively understand, question, challenge, and change the school and the classroom.    The thesis is written from the perspective of an indigenous Maori teacher trained in technocratic approaches of practice looking to aspects of her intimate culture, Tongan and Samoan ways of representing the world, and Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy to transform contemporary education that tends to exclude the adolescents from learning in school. This thesis is not simply another contribution to the ways in which teachers of school English in general think about methodologies and approaches to learning; rather, it is addressed more specifically to those Maori, Tongan, and Samoan teachers in this country who work with and alongside communities who are from the Kingdom of Tonga and the islands of Samoa. Thus, there is great value placed on educational experience with indigenous Tongan and Samoan teachers and students in an educational project referred to in the thesis as a &#8216;School-within-a-school&#8217;. The School-within-a-school refers to a site of education for teaching school English to immigrant adolescents within a large, state, secondary school in the city of Auckland. Particular attention is also paid to educational experience with indigenous teachers in a Curriculum Committee and Maori and Tongan grassroots organisations located within the same school.    A fresh approach to teaching English accepts culture as the ground on which to begin to reflect on a practice within a specific context. The teachers who have a dynamic relationship with students argue that culture is a primary site for contradictions and that a revolutionary challenge to technocratic pedagogy is necessary, but not sufficient, to value and actively include the students in school. Since the English language and its attendant practices, values, traditions, and aspirations are the grounds for the students' marginalisation, immediate, consciously organised changes in the teaching beliefs, contents of education, and society at large in Aotearoa are necessary parts of any reintegrative pedagogy.    On this account, the belief is that pedagogy is vitally important since it can enable the students to understand the technocratic discourse and draw upon the personal and collective experiences to counter the tendency that denies them full participation in school and the classroom.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, BILINGUAL AND MULTICULTURAL (0282)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0998)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SECONDARY (0533)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/47</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms underlying hypoxic ischemic injury to the developing brain: The significance of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9</field><field name="creator">Ranasinghe, Himani Sumudumalee</field><field name="description">Perinatal hypoxic ischemic (HI) injury is a leading cause of long-term neurological complications in newborn babies. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of endopeptidases that are capable of degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. They are considered to be integral in many physiological processes.  However, recently it has been demonstrated that the inappropriate activity of these proteases, particularly MMP-2 and 9, contribute to the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia in the adult brain. Given that ECM disruption is frequently observed following injury to the developing brain, it is possible that MMPs play an important role in HI injury processes in the developing brain. Therefore, this thesis evaluated the hypothesis that MMP-2 and 9 participate in the pathophysiology of HI injury to the developing brain. Since ECM remodelling is a fundamental process during brain development it was important to first characterise the MMP-2 and 9 profiles in the normal developing forebrain. We demonstrated that MMP-2, which mainly was observed in cortical plate neurons, declined with age, thus indicating a potential role in the development and differentiation of the cortical plate. Conversely, MMP-9 was increased with age, particularly during active myelination, indicating that it may contribute in myelination. Secondly, we showed an upregulation of MMP-9 within the ischemic core during the early hours following HI injury, suggesting that MMP-9 may be involved in the development of delayed injury processes following hypoxic ischemia. On the contrary, MMP-2 was strongly upregulated during a later stage following injury surrounding the ischemic core possibly suggesting that it plays a role in wound repair processes. Thirdly, the profiles of tissue (tPA) and urokinase (uPA) plasminogen activators were characterised following HI injury since they are known to be major upstream activators of MMPs. uPA upregulation paralleled that of MMP-2 suggesting a function for uPA in wound repair processes following HI injury to the developing brain through activation of MMP-2. In contrast with uPA, tPA activity remained unaffected following injury at both ages. Finally, MMP-9 activity was inhibited using a very specific MMP-2/9 inhibitor, SB-3CT, to determine if the MMP-9 deficiency protects the developing brain from HI injury. The elevated MMP-9 activity following HI injury was attenuated by the SB-3CT treatment. Although SB-3CT failed to confer any significant neuroprotection, we recommend that further investigations are needed before discounting the role of MMP-9 during HI injury to the developing brain. In conclusion, we suggest that MMP-9 is induced following an insult to the developing brain potentially contributing to the delayed neuronal death whilst MMP-2 is involved in essential developmental, differentiation and wound repair processes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Brain</field><field name="subject">Ischemia</field><field name="subject">Hypoxia</field><field name="subject">Injury</field><field name="subject">Developmental</field><field name="subject">MMP-9</field><field name="subject">MMP-2</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biomedical Science)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/4962</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The functional role of anthocyanins in leaves</field><field name="creator">Neill, Samuel Oliver</field><field name="description">The anthocyanins, a relatively small group of pigments in the diverse flavonoid family, are largely responsible for the red-blue colouration in a large number plant species worldwide. Their occurrence in fruits and flowers seems to offer clear benefits in attracting pollinators and aiding seed dispersal, however their presence in the vacuoles of leaves remains obscure. The accumulation of anthocyanin pigments in leaves can be induced by a host of disparate environmental and anthropogenic stressors, such as UV-exposure, wounding, pathogen infection, high light, chilling, pollution, osmotic stress, and nutrient deficiency. Anthocyanins are in some species expressed throughout leaf development; in others the pigments are found exclusively in the young, rapidly expanding leaves, or at later stages of leaf senescence. Many researchers have explored the possible functional role(s) of anthocyanins within leaves, although none of the hypotheses provides a unified explanation for the diverse range of environmental triggers, or for the variability in the pigment&#8217;s location and expression at particular stages of development. Differences in the cellular location of cyanic pigments had little effect on the optical properties of leaves from several native New Zealand species. Instead, the absorptance of green-yellow light was strongly proportional to the concentration of anthocyanin. Red leaves absorbed up to 17 % more PAR (400-700 nm) than green leaves of same species. The reflectance of red light was independent of leaf anthocyanin content. In Lactuca sativa, the absorption of light by anthocyanic cell vacuoles in the upper epidermis led to a reduction in the light incident on subjacent chlorenchyma. Under high irradiances, the dissipation of excess energy through non-photochemical processes (qNP) was lower in the red regions of the leaves than in the green regions. Red L. sativa, maintained higher photochemical efficiencies (0PSII), and had greater rates of photochemical quenching (qP) than the green tissues. Moreover, the cyanic areas were photoinhibited significantly less (7 %), as measured by levels of maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm), than green areas during a high light treatment of 1300 mmol m-2 s-1. Chloroplast suspensions from shade adapted L. sativa generated less superoxide (O2 -) through the Mehler reaction and had reduced rates of chlorophyll bleaching, when irradiated with 300 mmol m-2 s-1 of red light rather than white light. These data demonstrated the impact of the light-filtering effects of anthocyanins on the photophysiology of the leaves. Complementary to their light-shielding functions, anthocyanins also demonstrated potent antioxidant capabilities at pH values typical of both the cytoplasm and the vacuole. The addition of cyanidin-3-malonylglucoside, which was colourless at the cytoplasmic pH, to a chloroplast suspension receiving high irradiance resulted in the significant scavenging of O2 -. The red, flavylium form of anthocyanin was also oxidised by O2 -. After 15 minutes, this oxidation equated to a 40 % reduction in antioxidant potential of the anthocyanin, as measured by cyclic voltammetry. The data suggested that anthocyanins could provide widespread cellular protection to cellular membranes, organelles, and DNA. Analysis of the overall antioxidant defence in red and green leaves of Elatostema rugosum, a shade-adapted herb native to New Zealand, and Quintinia serrata, a native tree found on exposed ridges, provided evidence for a photoprotective role of anthocyanins. Red leaves of E. rugosum were on average five-times more effective at scavenging DPPH radicals than were green leaves. The anthocyanins constituted the most active phenolic component, providing a greater relative contribution to the antioxidant pool than the flavones, flavonols, and hydroxycinnamic acids. In contrast, red and green leaves of Q. serrata exhibited comparable ranges in antioxidant activities. The data suggest that for some species, anthocyanins can supplement the pool of low molecular weight antioxidants but are not a prerequisite for protection from oxidative stress. It is likely that the localised accumulation of anthocyanins in the leaves of Q. serrata serves to shield photosynthetic tissues that are the more susceptible to photodamage. In conclusion, the accumulation of anthocyanins represents a multifunctional mechanism to; i) directly reduce ROS through scavenging and possibly metal chelation, acting in conjunction with other antioxidants, and ii) to shield photosynthetic processes experiencing excessive irradiances, thereby reducing the extent of photooxidation, photoinhibition, and wasteful dissipatory systems. Such protection may be vital for leaves experiencing stressful environments.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pier scour countermeasures</field><field name="creator">Lauchlan, Christine Sandra</field><field name="description">Riprap is the most commonly employed countermeasure where bridge piers need to be protected against possible undermining by scour. An extensive review of available design techniques revealed a wide range of equations and proposed design procedures but no generally accepted method for riprap sizing and implementation. The aim of this study was to develop a design procedure for riprap protection at piers which can be used in most river environments.    The failure mechanisms and stability of riprap layers around cylindrical and rectangular shaped piers were examined in a comprehensive experimental study. The study assessed the importance of various riprap, flow, sediment, and pier parameters. Parameters for investigation were determined by dimensional analysis and included riprap placement and arrangement.    A riprap size prediction formula was developed based on an allowable maximum local scour depth of up to 20%. This equation has been incorporated in a design approach which was tested through a model study of the Hutt Estuary Bridge. The influence of various parameters on riprap stability are incorporated in the equation by way of adjustment factors.    The adjustment factors, KY and KD, represent the effects of riprap placement and pier/sediment size ratio effects respectively. They were deemed the most important parameters in riprap layer performance and are therefore included in the riprap size prediction formula. Additional experiments using synthetic filters have shown their ability to eliminate local scour, however they are susceptible to failure under degrading bed conditions.    Degrading bed conditions cause the riprap to subside as a layer with the downward movement of the surrounding bed. Subsidence allows the layer to withstand rapid short term degradation. However long term degradation will ultimately result in failure of the stone protection.    A preliminary experimental study of the use of submerged vanes as a scour countermeasure was performed. Submerged vanes have been used previously in channel protection with much success. Results indicate that vanes with a length to height ratio greater than one can reduce the maximum local scour depth in live bed conditions by as much as 34%. Further testing is required to develop a complete design procedure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, CIVIL (0543)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290800 Civil Engineering::290801 Structural engineering</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Civil and Resource Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of some external factors on root hair demography in Trifolium repens L. and Lolium perenne L.</field><field name="creator">Care, Debbie Anne</field><field name="description">Light microscopy, low ionic strength solution culture and image analysis methods were used to make detailed measurements on root hair populations of different genotypes of white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). A model of root hair population structure was developed and validated that will facilitate research on root hairs of these species.    Diagrams were drawn of the root hair length and frequency on entire root systems. The distributions of root hairs on these diagrams often differed from textbook diagrams of root hairs because root hair length and frequency varied considerably along the root axis.    The key issue examined was the response at species, population and genotype levels of root hair populations perturbed by aluminium and phosphate, and the implications of these responses for our understanding of the strategies adopted by plants growing in stressful environments.    Demographic growth analysis gave the best understanding of the mechanisms of root hair population response to genetic variability, resource depletion and environmental perturbation. Root hair length seemed to be controlled by the individual root hair. However the number of root hairs appeared to be controlled by the root. Therefore it is the root that controls the distribution of the hairs on the root, and how this distribution is modified by perturbation.    Root hair populations were shown to have strategies that were similar to their shoot system growth strategies-guerrilla for clover, phalangeal for ryegrass. The root and root hair systems, and shoot systems also demonstrated similar characteristics when the r and K strategy model was applied. At an ecosystem level, clover and ryegrass occupied the same orthogonal in the CSR (competitive-stress-ruderal) model. Therefore at a larger scale, these plants are able to coexist, but they do this by having different strategies at a species level.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, BOTANY (0309)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, ECOLOGY (0329)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, PLANT PHYSIOLOGY (0817)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Botany (Biological Sciences))--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/50</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative genetics of anthropometric variation in the Solomon Islands</field><field name="creator">Black, Stephen James</field><field name="description">This work follows the direction set by Sewall Wright in applying path analysis, and other multivariate statistical techniques, to the study of anthropometric variation. Data on anthropometric variation of six Solomon Island populations is analyzed using statistical models which can distinguish between within-group and between-group genetic variation.    The correlation structure of 27 anthropometric measurements is examined by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. The six populations show a common pattern (in both males and females) which echoes earlier studies. The correlation matrix of measurements is then partitioned into genetic and environmental components and the genetic correlation matrix is examined, once again by cluster analysis and principal components analysis. There is a fairly close agreement between the genetic correlation structure and the phenotypic correlation structure. The environmental correlation matrix is not examined further because it is very poorly estimated.    The partitioning of phenotypic correlations into genetic and environmental components is based on a multivariate generalization of a path model for the heritability of a continuous trait proposed by C. C. Li. The parameters estimated in the single trait model include additive genetic heritability, common home environment, and genetic correlation between spouses. In order to fit this model observations are required on parent-offspring, spouse-spouse, and sib-sib correlations. Heritability values for the Solomons are markedly lower than those reported elsewhere. However, when total heritability (ignoring subpopulation structure) is estimated for the six Solomons populations, the values are higher and form a more familiar pattern. The striking differences between the two kinds of heritability in the Solomon Islands emphasizes the danger of using total heritability estimates obtained from several subpopulations or a national sample.    The between-group component of heritability for each measurement is compared to the within-group heritability and to levels of between-group phenotypic variation. The results demonstrate that high within-group heritability for a given trait does not imply that between-group variation in that trait is genetic in origin.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, PHYSICAL (0327)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::370000 Studies in Human Society::370300 Anthropology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1982.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/51</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems with variable-bit-rate traffic</field><field name="creator">Sowden, Bradley Claude</field><field name="description">The deployment of third generation (3G) cellular systems is resulting in a transition from cellular systems that predominantly carry constant-bit-rate (CBR) voice traffic to multi-service packet based systems that predominantly carry variable-bit-rate (VBR) traffic. With 3G DS-CDMA cellular systems there is a direct relationship between user traffic and propagation dependent performance as additional traffic causes increased system interference. This thesis investigates the impact of VBR traffic on the propagation dependent performance of DS-CDMA cellular systems that utilise frame-by-frame dynamic resource allocation on the radio channel. A DS-CDMA cellular system model is developed and the downlink performance of both outdoor macro-cellular and indoor pico-cellular systems is evaluated with a variety of traffic types. Both traffic scheduling performance and propagation dependent performance are evaluated as the two are inter-linked. Scenarios are identified where propagation dependent performance is sensitive to the statistical properties of the user traffic streams and it is shown that a significant performance difference potentially exists between different traffic types when the number of users per cell is low. When a significant performance difference does exist, burstier more variable traffic generally results in superior propagation dependent performance. The base transceiver station (BTS) transmitter power mean and variance provides a good indication of the level of propagation dependent performance regardless of the specific traffic type. Traffic scheduling policies that deliberately reduce the variability of user traffic streams are considered and in terms of propagation dependent performance these are shown to have a minimal impact on the performance difference between different traffic types. The implications of VBR traffic on DS-CDMA cellular system design are outlined and it is shown that VBR traffic can be approximated as CBR traffic in many scenarios and this is a convenient approximation as it simplifies system design and detailed traffic models do not need to be developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::290900 Electrical and Electronic Engineering</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Electrical and Electronic Engineering)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular and Ecological Aspects of Heliothis Armigera</field><field name="creator">Waghorn, Tania Susanne</field><field name="description">The species status and host range of Heliothis armigera was investigated. DNA profiling, mitochondrial DNA sequencing, RAPD's, along with traditional morphological and crossing methods were used to investigate micro, macro and mega-population structuring. Thirty-six new host records were added, of which a number are important common weeds and crops. Mortality due to parasitoids and fungal infections were quantified on many host species. Genetic analysis of the COII and the AT-rich regions of the mitochondrial DNA showed very high levels of variation, as did the DNA profiling using the probes (CA)n and 33.15. The morphological analyses also showed variation, but to a lesser degree and without statistical significance. The variation found at all levels and in all aspects is discussed with respect to caterpillar host-plants and geographical location. All host-plant populations of caterpillars showed very high levels of genetic variability. However, the population of caterpillars found on Sulla (Hedysarium coronarium) was significantly more variable than those found on Lotus and Lucerne when compared using DNA profiling. The sequences obtained from the two mtDNA regions also showed considerable variation, a great percentage of which was uninformative. This variation did not allude to any structuring of caterpillar populations with respect to host-plant or geographical location. H. armigera is genetically a very variable species which does not equate with any population structuring present in the host-plant or geographical populations investigated here. This study has greatly increased the general understanding of this insect, and has elucidated a portion of the genetic makeup, but not helped in the development any new control methods.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic evaluation of active labour market policy in New Zealand 1989 to 1997</field><field name="creator">Perry, Geoffrey E</field><field name="description">Active labour market programmes are an important component of government labour market policy internationally and in New Zealand. The growth in unemployment, and in particular male and long term unemployment, since the mid 1980's in New Zealand have contributed to the enhanced role of active labour market programmes in government policy. In the early 1990's the New Zealand government introduced a menu of interventions including subsidy, work experience and training programmes. Concomitant with this development has been increased pressure from political, business and social groups to assess the effectiveness of this approach in lowering unemployment. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the effect of active labour market policy utilised in New Zealand from 1989 to 1997. Whether or not these active labour market interventions were beneficial to those males who participated in them, the effect of treatment upon the treated, is the parameter estimated. The range of programmes makes it possible to analyse a number of programme evaluation issues. These include the overall question of the impact of subsidy, work experience and training programmes in general, but also other specific research questions. In particular the range of subsidy programmes makes it possible to identify that subsidies to private sector firms are more effective than those to public sector organisations. The effectiveness of start-up subsidies for the unemployed are also evaluated and found to be beneficial. The effects of participation upon selected education and ethnic groups are also estimated. Since there is no one estimation approach that works in all circumstances, both regression and matching estimators are used. In order to achieve this it is necessary to create two estimation datasets as the data requirements vary for each technique. The main findings from the research are that participation in active labour market programmes is beneficial in reducing the length of time that participants are registered as unemployed. Work experience programmes have the largest impact, followed by subsidies. The effect of training programmes is smallest. The major beneficial effect occurs in the year following participation and then reduces in subsequent years. There are also some important methodological findings, including the sensitivity of results to the time frame, to the datasets chosen, and to the estimation techniques used.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::340000 Economics</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Economics)--University of Auckland, 2007.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/525</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Writing ourselves 'home' : biographical texts : a method for contextualizing the lives of wahine Maori : locating the story of Betty Wark</field><field name="creator">Connor, D Helene</field><field name="description">This thesis consists of two sections. The intention of Section One, 'Biographical Texts: Theoretical Underpinning', is to explore and discuss the theoretical underpinnings of Maori feminism and Kaupapa Maori as they relate to biography as a research method into the lives of Maori women. Biography, as a literary genre is also examined with particular reference to feminist, women of colour and Maori biography. Section One is a wideranging section, encompassing a broad sweep of the literature in these areas. It both draws from existing literature and contributes to the discourse regarding Maori feminism, Maori biography and Maori research. It is relevant to but unconstrained by the content of Section Two. The intention of Section Two, 'Locating the Story of Betty Wark; A Biographical Narrative with Reflective Annotations', is to provide an example of the biographical method and what might constitute Maori biography. The subject of the biographical narrative, Betty Wark, was a Maori woman who was actively involved with community-based organisations from the 1950s until her death in May 2001. Several major themes which emerged from Betty's biographical history occur throughout her narrative and provide a framework in which her story is located. One of the most significant themes was the notion of 'home'; both literal and metaphorical. This theme is reflected in the title of the thesis, Writing Ourselves 'Home'.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Wark</field><field name="subject">Betty; Women</field><field name="subject">Maori Biography;Women</field><field name="subject">Maori Ethnic identity; Biography as a literary form</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies (0453)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420306 Maori cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Women's Studies)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/53</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of osmium and ruthenium complexes with ligands featuring group 14 and 15 donor atoms</field><field name="creator">Woodgate, Scott Darren</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the preparation and chemistry of osmium and ruthenium complexes with ligands featuring the group 14 donor atoms carbon and silicon, and the group l5 donor atom phosphorus. Aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl complexes of osmium and ruthenium, prepared via mercury reagents, are discussed in Chapter One. 5-Coordinate 2-halophenyl complexes M(C6H4X-2)CI(CE)(PPh3)2 (M = Os; X = C1, Br; E = O, S; M = Os; X = I E = O; M = Ru; X = CI, Br, E = O) were synthesised by reaction of organomercury reagents Hg(C6H4X-2)2 (X = C1, I, Br) with MHC1(CO)(PPh3)3: (M = Os, Ru). Os(C6H4X-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os; X = C1, I, Br) were characterised structurally and the interaction between X and M examined. Attempted benzyne syntheses using these complexes were not successful. 6-Coordinate complexes M(C6H4X-2)C1(CO)(CE)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, X = C1, E = O, S; Br, E = O, S; M = Os, E = O, X = I; M = Ru, E = O, X = C1, Br) were prepared by the addition of carbon monoxide to the corresponding 5-coordinate precursors. Approaches towards reduction of these complexes are discussed. The structure of Os(C6H4C1-2)C1(CS)(CO)(PPh3)2 revealed that the thiocarbonyl and the aryl halide ligands were cis and therefore in an ideal geometry to rearrange and form a substituted thioacyl ligand. Indeed, on heating Os(C6H4X-2)C1(CS)(CO)(PPh3)2 (X = C1, Br) the corresponding thioacyl complexes Os(&#951;2-CS{C6H4X-2})C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (X = C1, Br) were formed. The decreased electron density in the halo aryl rings of these thioacyl complexes, combined with the fact that the halide substituents were no longer bonded to the metal, enabled facile lithiation of the aryl rings, even at low temperature. Quenching the appropriate lithiated intermediate with Bu3SnC1 gave Os(&#951;2-CS{C6H4SnBu3-2})C1(CO)(PPh3)2. These results suggested that M(C6H4{CH2X}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru) were worthwhile target complexes for lithiation studies. To this end, Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 was prepared but attempts to convert the alcohol into a tosylate (for subsequent reaction with LiX) were unsuccessful and so this chemistry was not pursued further. Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 transferred the benzylic alcohol groups to osmium and ruthenium, albeit in low yields. Oxidation of Hg(C6H4{CH2OH}-2)C1 with PCC provided the benzaldehyde-containing mercury complex Hg(C6H4{CHO}-2)C1, symmetrization of which gave Hg(C6H4{CHO}-2)2. The latter compound was used to prepare aldehyde complexes of osmium and ruthenium, as well as mercury(II) benzaldoxime and benzaldimines. The aldehyde oxygen atoms in the osmium and ruthenium complexes were bound to the metals and were unaffected by amines, and by attempts to displace them from the metals. The addition of dimethyldithiocarbamate to Ru(C6H4{CHO}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 displaced a triphenylphosphine ligand and Ru(C6H4{CHO}-2)(CO)({CH3}2NCS2)(PPh3) was formed. Transfer of the benzaldoxime ligand, and various benzaldimine ligands [C6H4{C[H]=NR] R = Me, CH2CH2NEt2, CH2CH2NMe2], to osmium or ruthenium gave M(C6H4{C[H]=NR}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Ru, R = OH; M = Os, Ru; R = Me, CH2CH2NEt2;M= Ru, R = CH2CH2NMe2). The derived cationic complexes Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NCH2CH2NHR2}-2)C1(CO)(PPh3)2]BF4 (R - Me, Et) were prepared by protonation of the benzaldimine complexes with HBF4+ and Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NCH2CH2NR2}-2)(Co)(PPh3)2]BF4(R = Me, Et)were prepared by addition of AgBF4. Bromination of Ru(C6H4{C[H]=NMe}-2)C1(Co)(PPh3)2 gave Ru(C6H3{C[H]=NMe}-2, Br-4)C1(Co)(PPh3)2 which was lithiated at low temperature. The aryllithium was quenched with Bu3SnC1 to give Ru(C6H3 { C[H]=NMe}-2,SnBu3-4)C1(CO)(PPh3)2. The reaction of alkynylmercury reagents with osmium and ruthenium complexes are discussed in the following sections. Treatment of RuHCI(CO)(PPh3)2 with Hg(C&#8801;CPh)2 has been reported previously, the result being formation of an &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand. However, the corresponding reaction with OsHCI(CO)(PPh3)3 resulted in catalysed coupling of the alkyne. This reaction was re-examined and the 6-coordinate &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl osmium complex was prepared by direct reaction of the 5-coordinate complex with acetate ion. A dicarbonyl complex containing the &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand, Os(C{C&#8801;Ph}=CHPh)CI(CO)2(PPh3)2, was prepared by the addition of carbon monoxide in the presence of LiC1 to the acetate complex. Thiocarbonyl complexes containing an &#945;-phenylethynyl-trans-&#946;-styryl ligand were prepared. Addition of carbon monoxide to solutions containing these complexes gave the thioacyl analogues M(&#951;2-CS{C[C&#8801;CPh]=CHPh})C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru). The remaining sections in Chapter One examine the reactions of mercury(II) reagents with the osmium(O) complexes Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 and OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3. Oxidative addition of the mercury-carbon bond of HgR2 (R = C6H4CH34, C&#8801;CPh, trans-CH=CHPh) to Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 gave OsR(HgR)(CO)2(PPh3)2. Reaction of the acetylide or styryl complexes with iodine resulted in cleavage of the osmium-mercury bond and yielded either Os(C&#8801;CPh)I(CO)2(PPh3)2 or Os(trans-CH=CHPh)I(CO)2(PPh3)2. Similar complexes were not accessible from reaction of the osmium(II) complex OsHC1(CO)(PPh3)3 with the appropriate mercury reagent. Whereas the mercury reagents reacted with Os(CO)2(PPh3)3 to give the simple oxidative addition products, the corresponding reactions of OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 with HgR2 did not always give the analogous products OsR(HgR)C1(NO)(PPh3)2. Addition of Hg(C6H4CH3-4)2 to OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 gave a mixture of the bis(p-tolyl) complex Os(C6H4CH3-4)2C1(NO)(PPh3)2 and the mono(p-tolyl) complex Os(C6H4CH3-4)CI2(NO)(PPh3)2. The structure of the bis(p-tolyl) complex revealed that the p-tolyl ligands were trans and the metal-carbon(aryl) bond lengths were extremely long. Addition of pyridine to the bis(p-tolyl) complex gave Os(C6H4CH3-4)2(C5H5N)CI(NO)(PPh3), which contained two cis p-tolyl ligands. The reactions of Hg(C6H4C1-2)2 and Hg(C&#8801;CPh)Ph with OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 gave complexes containing a single organic ligand. In contrast, treatment of OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 with either Hg({C4H4S-2})2 or Hg([C4H4SMe-5]-2})2 gave the dithienyl complexes OsR2CI(NO)(PPh3)2 [R = (C4H4S)-2, ({C4H4SMe-5})-2. Furthermore, the reaction of Hg(CF3)2 with OsC1(NO)(PPh3)3 gave Os(CF3)(Hg{CF3})CI(NO)(PPh3)2. Treatment of OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3 with Hg(trans-CH=CHPh)2 gave Os(trans-CH=CHPh)CI2(NO)(PPh3)2 and an osmaindene complex, Os(C6H4CH=CH)H(NO)(PPh3)2, which in turn gave Os(C6H4CH=CH)Cl(No)(PPh3)2 on treatment with HCl. Chapter Two examines osmabenzene chemistry. Spectroscopic data were collected for the known complexes Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, and Os(C[SH]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-CI)(CO)(PPh3)2. Oxidation of the osmabenzene thiol to a sulfinic acid was attempted. Methylation of the parent complex, Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, gave the product of kinetic control as Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(CO)(PPh3)2, reported previously, which rearranged on heating to give the trans isomer, Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(trans-I)(CO)(PPh3)2. Approaches to auration of the sulphur in Os(&#951;2-C[S]CH=CHCH=CH)(CO)(PPh3)2, are described. Although the metallabenzenes reported previously have physical properties comparable with those of benzene itself, little evidence has been reported to suggest that the chemical reactivity of metallabenzenes is similar to that of benzene. The research described in this chapter provides the first example of a metallabenzene complex that undergoes aromatic electrophilic substitution. Thus, the metallabenzene complex Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(Co)(PPh3)2was brominated, chlorinated, and even iodinated. Crystal structure determinations and NMR studies showed that C5, which was activated by the thioether functionality, was the preferred site of electrophile attack. Even more significantly, Os(C[SMe]CH=CHCH=CH)(cis-I)(Co)(PPh3)2 was nitrated with either Cu(NO3)2/acetic anhydride, or with the more potent reagent NO2CF3SO3.CF3SO3H. The site of nitration was identical with that of halogenation, namely, C5. Previous syntheses of metallabenzenes had reported the use of the simplest alkyne, ethyne. This chapter describes the first metallabenzene complex prepared from propyne, giving the metallabenzene Os(&#951;2-C[S]C{CH3}=CHCH=C{CH3})(CO)(PPh3)2 and the oxidative addition product Os(C&#8801;CCH3)H(CO)(CS)(PPh3)2. Ten of the metallabenzene complexes were characterised structurally and the significance of the carbon-carbon bond lengths in the metallacyclic rings are discussed. The complete characterisation of these complexes by NMR spectroscopy revealed that the ring protons in the metallabenzene complexes, excepting H6, were at chemical shifts similar to those expected for normal aromatic carbons. Chapter Three examines the coordination of the strongly &#1495;-accepting tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand to osmium. Two tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine complexes of Os(II), OsHCI(CO)(PPh3)2(P{NC4H4}3) and OsH(C6H4CH3-4)(CO)(PPh3)2(P{NC4H4}3), were prepared. Both of these showed significantly higher infrared carbonyl stretching absorptions than the analogous triphenylphosphine complexes, reflecting the &#1495;-acceptor nature of the tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand. The osmium(O) complexes Os(CE)(CO)(PPh3)2P(NC4H4)3 (E = O, S) were prepared and the carbonyl complex was characterised structurally. The osmium-phosphorus(pyrrolyl) bond length of this complex was relatively short. The tris(N-pyrrolyl)phosphine ligand was in the equatorial plane as were the two carbonyl ligands. Chapter Four examines silyl and siloxane complexes of osmium and ruthenium. Although triethoxysilyl complexes of ruthenium have been prepared previously through ethanolysis of the coordinated SiCl3 group, the osmium analogues could not be prepared this way. It was found that Os(Si{OEt}3)CI(CO)(PPh3)2 could be prepared successfully by direct treatment of Os(Ph)Cl(CO)(PPh3)2 with triethoxysilane. Addition of carbon monoxide to the 5-coordinate triethoxysilyl complex afforded the dicarbonyl complex. The triethoxysilyl nitrosyl complex, OsH(Si{OEt}3)CI(NO)(PPh3)2, was prepared by oxidative addition of triethoxysilane to OsCI(NO)(PPh3)3, and the siloxane nitrosyl complex, Os(O[Si{OEt}3])CI2(NO)(PPh3 )2 was also characterised fully. Prior to this work only a single silatranyl complex was known. This chapter reports fifteen new silatranyl complexes and examines the unique properties conferred upon the silatrane by coordination to the metal. The silatranyl-containing complexes OsH(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(No)(pph3)2 and OsH(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)(CO)2(pph3)2 were formed by oxidative addition of silatrane to the appropriate osmium(O) complex. Neither was suitable for further research because the chloro nitrosyl complex ejected silatrane in the presence of oxygen, and the dicarbonyl complex was isolated as a mixture of three isomers. In contrast, the unsaturated complexes M(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)C1(CO)(PPh3)2 (M = Os, Ru) were excellent materials for further study. The crystal structures of both of these complexes reveal typical metal-silyl distances with atypical silatranyl N&#8594;Si bond lengths. In both cases the N&#8594;Si bond length is elongated, the nitrogen is planar, and the cage is best described as quasi-silatranyl. The unsaturated nature of the metal in Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(CO)(PPh3)2 offered access to derived complexes. The &#1495;-acid carbon monoxide added to the vacant site forming Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)C1(co)2(pph3)2. Methylation of the 5-coordinate silatranyl complexes, gave [M(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)CI(CO)(PPh3)2]CF3SO3(M = Os, Ru). This reaction has not been achieved previously for silatrane derivatives. These methylated complexes have the longest recorded N&#8594;Si distances for any silatrane derivatives, and display a tetrahedral bridgehead nitrogen which points out of the cage at the methyl substituent. Protonation of the 5-coordinate silatranyl complexes gave [M(Si{OCH2CH2}3NH)CI(CO)(PPh3)2]CF3SO3 (M = Os, Ru). The thiocarbonyl-containing derivatives Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)CI(CS)(PPh3)2 and [Os(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)CI(CS)(PPh3)2]CF3S03 were prepared and these complexes showed spectroscopic properties similar to those observed for the carbonyl-containing analogues. The 5-coordinate silatranyl-thiocarbonyl complex rearranged in the presence of carbon monoxide to form Os(&#951;2-C{S}Si{OCH2CH2}3N))CI(CO)(PPh3)2, which did not contain a metal-silicon bond. The silatranyl cage in the structure of this complex showed a very short N&#8594;Si bond with the nitrogen centre tetrahedral and pointing into the cage and towards the silicon atom. The osmium(IV) complex OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3N)(pph3)2 was prepared from OsH4(PPh3)2 and silatrane. The structure of this complex showed that the hydride ligands were oriented trans to a single triphenylphosphine in each case. Treatment of this complex with methyl iodide gave the quaternary salt [OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3NMe)(PPh3)3]I, and protonation gave [OsH3(Si{OCH2CH2}3NH)(PPh3)3]CF3SO3.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::250000 Chemical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemistry)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stability and bifurcation of deterministic infectious disease models</field><field name="creator">Korobeinikov, Andrei</field><field name="description">Autonomous deterministic epidemiological models are known to be asymptotically stable. Asymptotic stability of these models contradicts observations. In this thesis we consider some factors which were suggested as able to destabilise the system. We consider discrete-time and continuous-time autonomous epidemiological models. We try to keep our models as simple as possible and investigate the impact of different factors on the system behaviour. Global methods of dynamical systems theory, especially the theory of bifurcations and the direct Lyapunov method are the main tools of our analysis.    Lyapunov functions for a range of classical epidemiological models are introduced. The direct Lyapunov method allows us to establish their boundedness and asymptotic stability. It also helps investigate the impact of such factors as susceptibles' mortality, horizontal and vertical transmission and immunity failure on the global behaviour of the system. The Lyapunov functions appear to be useful for more complicated epidemiological models as well.    The impact of mass vaccination on the system is also considered. The discrete-time model introduced here enables us to solve a practical problem-to estimate the rate of immunity failure for pertussis in New Zealand.    It has been suggested by a number of authors that a non-linear dependence of disease transmission on the numbers of infectives and susceptibles can reverse the stability of the system. However it is shown in this thesis that under biologically plausible constraints the non-linear transmission is unable to destabilise the system. The main constraint is a condition that disease transmission must be a concave function with respect to the number of infectives. This result is valid for both the discrete-time and the continuous-time models.    We also consider the impact of mortality associated with a disease. This factor has never before been considered systematically. We indicate mechanisms through which the disease-induced mortality can affect the system and show that the disease-induced mortality is a destabilising factor and is able to reverse the system stability. However the critical level of mortality which is necessary to reverse the system stability exceeds the mortality expectation for the majority of human infections. Nevertheless the disease-induced mortality is an important factor for understanding animal diseases.    It appears that in the case of autonomous systems there is no single factor able to cause the recurrent outbreaks of epidemics of such magnitudes as have been observed. It is most likely that in reality they are caused by a combination of factors.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::230000 Mathematical Sciences</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Mathematics)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/54</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anatomically-based, subject-specific modelling of lower limb motion during gait</field><field name="creator">Oberhofer, Katja</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::290000 Engineering and Technology::291500 Biomedical Engineering::291504 Biomechanical engineering</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Bioengineering)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reading storybooks in Vietnamese families as a language intervention: an activity analysis</field><field name="creator">Tran, Thanh-Binh Thi</field><field name="description">Leont'ev understood activity as a mutually influenced process between the subject and the objective world. This process makes changes in both the subject and the objective world. He described activity as a system with its own structure which is created by its basic components and interrelationships among these components and the environment in which the activity exists (Leont'ev, 1978, 1981). In this research, an adapted model of Leont'ev's activity psychology, incorporating Gal'perin's stage model of formation of mental action and concepts (Gal'perin, 1992), and other developmental concepts (Bronfenbronner, 1979; Bruner, 1977; McNaughton, 1995; Rogoff, 1990, 2003; Vygotsky, 1978), was employed for design, implementation and evaluation of a family storybook reading activity intervention. This new approach of joint activity to early language intervention is the original contribution of the present research. This research aimed to describe and demonstrate effects of the intervention on individual children's vocabulary and comprehension development, before school and over the transition to school. A semi longitudinal set of case studies combined with a single-subject experimental design was chosen. Less well educated Vietnamese parents were provided with support, in order to develop their children's language, through storybook reading. Six families in Vietnam received storybooks, a workshop with shared reading techniques, a DVD of family shared reading samples, and home coaching sessions.  The data from the Baseline, Intervention and Maintenance phases showed that the parents made changes in their understanding of: Family shared reading benefits, how to select high-quality storybooks and how to set reading goals suitable to their own child's ability and interest. They also improved their shared reading techniques. Through the joint reading activity, the children's vocabulary increased significantly, especially in using expressive words. Changes in narrative comprehension were recorded. This progress was sustained over a period of 22 weeks after the intervention. The findings provide evidence of the completeness and generativeness of the theoretical framework for family literacy education. The model acted as a tool to guide a family literacy intervention. The research population was small and further studies in different literacy learning and teaching contexts are needed to enhance its practical implications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparison of the effect of implicit/explicit and immediate/delayed corrective feedback on learners' performance in tailor-made test</field><field name="creator">Varnosfadrani, Azizollah Dabaghi</field><field name="description">The study investigated the effects of correction of learners' grammatical errors on acquisition. Specifically, it compared the effects of timing of correction (immediate versus delayed correction) and manner of correction (explicit versus implicit correction). It also investigated the relative effects of correction of morphological versus syntactic features and correction of developmental early versus developmental late features. Data for the study were collected from 56 intermediate level students of English as a Foreign Language in Iranian university and private language school settings. Each participant was required to read and then retell a written text in their own words during an oral interview with the researcher. During or following the interview the researcher corrected the participants on their grammatical errors implicitly (using recasts) or explicitly (providing metalinguistic information). Individualised tests focusing on the errors that had been corrected were constructed for each participant and administered. Statistical analyses were conducted on the scores the participants received on their individualised tests. Results showed no significant differences for timing of correction. However, significant differences were found for manner of correction. Participants who received explicit correction gained significantly higher scores than those who received implicit correction. This finding lends support to the argument of Schmidt (1994) concerning the role of metalinguistic awareness in language acquisition. Correction of morphological features was found to be more effective than that of syntactic features. It is argued that morphological features are generally learnt as items whereas syntactic features involve system learning. Correction of developmental early features was found to be more effective than correction of developmental late features. This finding lends support to suggestions that corrective feedback (like other types of form-focused instruction) needs to take into account learners' cognitive readiness to acquire features (Pienemann 1984; Mackey 1999). iii Analyses of the interactions between independent variables were also conducted. It was found that explicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental early features and implicit correction was more effective for the acquisition of developmental late features The implications of these results for both second language acquisition and language pedagogy are considered.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Language, General (0679)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Language Learning and Teaching)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/55</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pathogenesis and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis</field><field name="creator">Reid, IR(Ian Reginald)</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (MD)--University of Auckland, 1988.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into the immunopathology of inflammatory arthritis</field><field name="creator">McQueen, Fiona Marion Florence</field><field name="description">This volume contains an introduction to the topic of inflammatory arthritis, followed by Chapter 2 which is a Materials and Methods section and includes experimental protocols used for the original research detailed in Chapters 3 to 6 (Sections 2.1 - 2.4).

We assessed the ELISPOT assay using cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and a natural gradient of M. tuberculosis exposure by sleeping proximity to a tuberculosis (TB) case in The Gambia. Two antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (EC), were compared to purified protein derivative (PPD) by ELISPOT and to the PPD skin test in 735 TB contacts. All three tests responded to the exposure gradient, the PPD skin test most dramatically. Inter-test comparison showed that the EC ELISPOT provided improved specificity in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection, but at the cost of some sensitivity. Increasing discordance, particularly between PPD ELISPOT and PPD skin test results, down the exposure gradient to 105 community controls was identified. In 693 children, the EC ELISPOT was slightly less sensitive than the PPD skin test in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection from recent exposure; neither test was confounded by prior BCG vaccination, even in the very young. A fusion protein of EC compared favourably with their respective peptides by ELISPOT assay in 488 TB contacts, a combined test result offered improved sensitivity. Quantitative ELISPOT and PPD-skin test responses were assessed in 1052 TB case contacts, according to an ELISPOT response to EC. Only the ELISPOT count was sensitive to the exposure gradient (p=0.009), revealing a positive dose-response relationship. In the longitudinal assessment, both ELISPOT and PPD skin test conversion occurred over time. PPD skin test reversion occurred in 10% of individuals after 18 months, ELISPOT reversion occurred in 39% at 3 months. In conclusion: the EC ELISPOT offers increased specificity in the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection in The Gambia, at the cost of some sensitivity; the PPD skin test appears to be down-regulated in the community; neither test is confounded by prior BCG vaccination; a fusion protein in combination with EC peptides offers optimal ELISPOT sensitivity; the quantitative ELISPOT response in specific-antigen-positive TB case contacts reflects the infectious load of M. tuberculosis; and significant early reversion of the ELISPOT test suggests it is unreliable in M. tuberculosis dormancy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::320100 Medicine-General</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (MD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring spiritual landscape in Sitka Alaska to enhance cross-cultural understanding</field><field name="creator">Alexander, Jordan Marijana</field><field name="description">This thesis examines spiritual landscapes, illustrating their richness in understanding cross-cultural relations and revealing deeper cultural attitudes toward the environment. It also shows that spiritual landscapes hold visible and invisible remnants of the past, providing insights for intercultural relations today. The research is timely, building on the momentum of international and national efforts to better understand and preserve indigenous cultures and settler heritages. The collisions of diverse cultures during first contact (1400s to 1700s) left society with enduring intercultural challenges. Perspectives on colonial impacts range from culture annihilation and land dispossession to legitimate expressions of imperial power and politics. Regarding land issues, conflicts persist in ownership and management (e.g., legislation and treaties), preservation and designation (e.g., how and whose values apply), and use and access (e.g., equitable provision and regulation of rival commercial, community and conservancy interests). This thesis elevates earlier judgements to reveal insights into land issues focusing on multicultural contributions. The comprehensive approach used to study Sitka Alaska&#8304;&#769;&#8328;s spiritual landscape considers spiritual indicators including burial grounds, worship buildings, homelands, and place names, alongside lasting cultural attitudes toward such places (geomentalities). Indigenous Tlingit, Russian and American contributions to patterns of settlement and development of sacred places are revealed in the cultural layering (palimpsest) evident in the contemporary landscape. Using an inclusive comparable platform broadens Western discourses of spirituality, planning and land management. It recognises multicultural aspects evident in contemporary settings, including power relations and settler practices of appropriation and conquest that continue in planning instruments and perpetuated spatial preferences. Such observations, together with spiritual indicators and attitudes provide a comprehensive exploration of Sitka&#8304;&#769;&#8328;s spiritual landscape to celebrate several cultural heritages on equal terms. With globalisation and ongoing land conflicts this work urges planners, policy makers and educators to consider the value of adding geographic and spiritual dimensions to enhance cross-cultural understanding. Practical applications for a range of local and international settings and individual decision-making are presented for consideration.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring notions of national style : New Zealand orchestral music in the late twentieth century</field><field name="creator">Keam, Glenda Ruth</field><field name="description">The question of cultural identity in New Zealand literature, visual art and music has been an important one for many decades. New Zealand's relative isolation, sparse population, short history and colonial past have all contributed to a heightened national awareness of, and sensitivity to, its cultural condition. This study aims to explore, with an analyst's eye and ear, notions of national style through a group of orchestral works. Contemporary critical musicology, which flourished in the 1990s, typically integrates various frames of reference and suggests that analysis be framed in the broader cultural context of a work's genesis and performance. Examining the ways in which New Zealand's notions of national identity have affected its artistic production, this study considers claims that the particular environmental conditions of the land have imprinted themselves onto the nation's music. Furthermore, it investigates claims that New Zealand's remote and open spaces have generated perceptible effects in the nation's musical style, while also asking whether the purported importance of the landscape is not actually a myth which sits alongside the nation's other myths of identity. The literature regarding notions of 'musical space' is surveyed, bringing to light a number of musical elements which may connote space. Seven New Zealand orchestral works, composed between 1976 and 1995 and signalled by the composers as having some connection with the land, are found to share musical features, thus suggesting a national style insofar as 'landscape' works from this period are concerned. I then examine the works for 'space' elements, to investigate whether there are identifiable elements which connote a 'sense of space' in New Zealand music. A corollary of this belief in a national style is that any influences at work from New Zealand land(scapes) on New Zealand music will produce different musical results from those at work from other land(scapes) on music in other countries. After noting the most prevalent musical elements in the New Zealand works, four comparable 'landscape' orchestral works from other countries are also discussed, in order to offset and contextualize the New Zealand findings. This is the first detailed study of New Zealand music that has investigated national style, concepts of landscape-in-music, and musical space through analytical examination. It thus contributes to the small but growing body of New Zealand musical studies, and to an overall picture of New Zealand cultural identity.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Music (0413)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Music)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/56</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for annotating and visualizing cellML models</field><field name="creator">Wimalaratne, Sarala M.</field><field name="description">The Physiome Project was established to develop tools for international collaboration and sharing physiological knowledge in the form of biological models and experimental data. The CellML language was developed in response to the need for a high-level language to represent and exchange mathematical models of biological processes.  The language provides a flexible framework for describing the dynamics of biological processes but does not explicitly lend itself to capturing the underlying biological concepts such as the entities and processes that these models represent. The relationship between the biological process and the mathematical model describing the biological process is also often complex. This makes it difficult to see the biological concepts which the CellML structures represent. A framework which supports visualizing the biological concepts and its relationship to the underlying CellML model would provide a very useful toolset for understanding the biological concepts modeled in CellML.  The CellML models need to be annotated with biological concepts in order to provide the machine interpretable data for generating a visual representation. We have developed an ontological framework which can be used to explicitly annotate CellML models with physical and biological concepts, a method to derive a simplified biological view from the annotations, a visual language for representing all biophysical processes captured in the CellML models, and a method to map the visual language to the ontological framework in order to automate the generation of visual representations of a model.  The proposed method of model visualization produces a result that is dependent on the structure of the CellML models which requires modelers to structure the model in a way that best describes the biophysical concepts and abstractions they wish to demonstrate. Our argument is that this leads to a best practice approach to building and organizing models.  As a part of this research, a software tool for visualizing CellML models was developed. This tool combines the visual language and the ontologies to generate visualizations that depict the physical and biological concepts captured in CellML models and enables different communities in diverse disciplines to more easily understand CellML models within the biological domain they represent.  As research continues, with further improvement to the framework it would be possible to visually construct composite CellML models by selecting high level biological concepts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Methods for incorporating biological information into the statistical analysis of gene expression microarray data</field><field name="creator">Leader, Debbie</field><field name="description">Microarray technology has made it possible for researchers to simultaneously measure  the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes. It is believed that most human  diseases and biological phenomena occur through the interaction of groups of genes  that are functionally related. To investigate the feasibility of incorporating functional  information and/or constraints (based on biological and technical needs) into the classification  process two approaches were examined in this thesis.  The first of these approaches investigated the effect of incorporating a pre-filter into  the gene selection step of the classifier construction process. Both simulated and real  microarray datasets were used to assess the utility of this approach. The pre-filter was  based on an early method for determining if a gene had undergone a biologically relevant  level of differential expression between two classes. The genes retained by the pre-filter  were ranked using one of five standard statistical ranking methods and the most highly  ranked were used to construct a predictive classifier. To generate the simulated data  a selection of different parametric and non-parametric techniques were employed. The  results from these analyses showed that when the constraints that the pre-filter contains  were placed on the classification analysis, the predictive performance of the classifiers  were similar to when the pre-filter was not used.  The second approach explored the feasibility of incorporating sets of functionally  related genes into the classification process. Three publicly available datasets obtained  from studies into breast cancer were used to assess the utility of this approach. A  summary of each gene-set was derived by reducing the dimensionality of each gene-set  via the use of Principal Co-ordinates Analysis. The reduced gene-sets were then ranked  based on their ability to distinguish between the two classes (via Hotelling&#8217;s T2) and  those most highly ranked were used to construct a classifier via logistic regression. The  results from the analyses undertaken for this approach showed that it was possible  to incorporate function information into the classification process whilst maintaining  an equivalent (if not higher) level of predictive performance, as well as improving the  biological interpretability of the classifier.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Our lands, our selves: the postcolonial literary landscape of Maurice Gee and David Malouf</field><field name="creator">McWilliams, Amber</field><field name="description">Landscape is an enduring feature of Antipodean settler literature. Postcolonial fiction in New Zealand and Australia draws on pre-colonial, colonial, and postcolonial narratives of landscape to create compelling representations of place and people. In the adult fiction of New Zealand author Maurice Gee and Australian author David Malouf, characters typically turn to the landscape at moments of crisis or transition. Close analysis of Gee&#8217;s and Malouf&#8217;s fiction demonstrates that the physical environment serves as a touchstone for personal and national identity throughout personal and national histories. From childhood to old age, characters seek self-definition by locating themselves within their physical environment, rather than by directly referencing their social or cultural context. Individual life stages are shown to be analogous to early stages of national development for New Zealand and Australia &#8211; the journey from colonial child to mature identity for both the individual and the nation is figured through landscape images. However, Gee and Malouf also use the relationship between characters and landscape to reflect social attitudes and values, demonstrating a connection between confident identification with the &#8216;other&#8217; of the landscape and the ability to integrate meaningfully with the &#8216;others&#8217; of human society.

This study explores a key issue: the role and importance of imagination in the developmental stages of spiritual intelligence in students within each of these groups. By comparing students in a Catholic integrated school with those in a State intermediate school, it identifies both similarities and differences that teachers need to take into account in carrying out their professional responsibilities. The study begins by analysing and explaining concepts of spiritual intelligence that are often a source of ambiguity and confusion for teachers. It draws on a well-established hierarchal stage developmental theory of spiritual intelligence, but supplements this with a corresponding account of the role of imagination in the formation of spiritual intelligence at each of these stages. Spiritual intelligence is based on a theistic definition and its development on the imagination side of cognition rather than emotions. This results in the development of a nine stage taxonomy which is tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The research design examines seven important social factors, or variables, affecting the development of spiritual intelligence: school age group (intermediate, middle and senior), gender (male and female), school sample type (gifted and talented and average mainstream), areas of giftedness and talent (bodily-kinaesthetic, logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, interpersonal and environmental), type of school (state and integrated), ethnicity (New Zealand European and others) and religion (Catholic, non-Catholic Christians, other religions and no religion). Using Fisher's Exact Test of variance, current trends in the spiritual intelligence characteristics of students are identified. The study provides teachers with four statistically verified tasks, their respective criterion referenced task assessment schedules (CRS) and exemplars for assessing stages of development of spiritual intelligence in students. The findings of this research project will help teachers of Values Education and Religious Education, Directors of Religious Studies (DRS) and Boards of Trustees in Catholic integrated schools to understand the theoretical and pedagogical principles of spiritual development, enabling them to design research-based programmes for advancing spiritual intelligence in their students.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2010.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pedagogy of the clinic: health professionals and women with viral sexually transmitted infections</field><field name="creator">Cook, Catherine</field><field name="description">This study investigates sexual health teaching and its effects. The focus is on how the health clinic works as a pedagogical environment where lessons are offered by clinicians to women patients (often unwittingly) about morality, femininity and the body. Of central concern is the question of how health professionals might contribute to women's quality of life after a viral STI diagnosis. I use examples of the reported engagement between clinicians, women and the two most common viral STIs, the human papilloma virus (HPV) and the herpes simplex virus (HSV). To consider the effects of the myriad beliefs that inform clinical teaching I draw from poststructuralist feminist discourse theory. For data collection I used in-depth email interviews, a research method that allowed participants with viral STIs to 'speak' more freely than might be possible in face-to-face interviews. The method also readily enabled me to interview sexual health clinicians and other women within a wide geographical area, in New Zealand, Australia, North America and England. My research findings include the insights that: by the time women seek out medical care for a viral STI they have received considerable social 'education' that STIs are categorically different from other conditions; although clinicians emphasise the normalcy of viral STIs they tend to have limited knowledge of the difficulties women face in disruptions to sexuality after a diagnosis. Liberal views about sex do not necessarily make the negotiation of safer heterosexual sex and prevention of STI transmission easier for women. Women found it helpful when clinicians addressed both the medical 'normalcy' of viral STIs and their potential to disrupt women's sense of self, sexual and social relationships. In public health education, gynaecological examinations are presented as a routine and essential practice, yet my study found that such examinations are often difficult for women. Research addressing women's reasons for non-compliance with screening emphasises 'underlying' psychological categories of 'anxiety' and 'poor coping'. Minimal attention is paid to the effects of clinicians' interventions upon women's decision-making. My findings indicate that women's screening compliance is influenced by clinicians' gender, (in) attention to power relations, rapport-building, attentiveness to bodily (dis)comfort, and technical skill. In striving for non-judgmental, scientific teaching, clinicians were often unaware that their talk inevitably constituted viral STIs as 'moral' infections. Clinicians may best contribute to women's lives by acknowledging that medical discourse is only one part of the fragmentary and contradictory education women receive about bodies and selves.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5632</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of prenatal dietary methyl donor deficiency on development and epigenetic mechanisms in offspring : studies in the rat</field><field name="creator">Konycheva, Galina</field><field name="description">Human epidemiological and animal studies suggest that unbalanced maternal diet during  pregnancy leads to low birth weight and predisposes offspring to the development of a number  of pathological conditions like metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. This effect is referred to  as fetal or developmental programming, however the underlying mechanism is yet unknown. An  epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation, DNA methylation, has been suggested as a strong  candidate for the underling mechanism of developmental programming due to the fact that  establishment of DNA methylation patterns begins during early development and requires a  constant supply of methyl donors. The main purpose of the present study was to determine  whether a deficiency of methyl donors in the maternal diet during prenatal development would  result in phenotypic changes and abnormal epigenetic gene regulation in the offspring. The study  was designed to help understand whether DNA methylation provides an epigenetic basis to  developmental programming.  A new rat model of prenatal dietary methyl donor deficiency was established, whereby female  rats were fed a diet deficient in methyl donors choline, folate and methionine two weeks prior to  mating and throughout pregnancy. The effect of prenatal exposure to methyl donor deficiency on  developmental programming was investigated by measuring systolic blood pressure, glucose  metabolism, endocrine pancreas structure and behavioral changes in the adult offspring. To  investigate immediate and delayed effects of maternal methyl donor deficiency on molecular  processes in the offspring, liver, pancreas, kidney, lung and hippocampus tissues were being  used for specific DNA methylation measurements by means of Matrix assisted laser  desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Expression of target genes, suggested to  be regulated by DNA methylation, was tested using a real time PCR-based technique.  The offspring of methyl deficient mothers (MD) had low weight at birth. Young adult MD males  had a transient increase in systolic blood pressure and altered pancreatic structure, but no  changes in glucose metabolism. Aged female and male MD offspring demonstrated traits of  anxiety-like behavior. MD females had improved learning abilities. At the molecular level, the  offspring of MD mothers showed age, DNA region and tissue-specific changes in DNA  methylation. The MD offspring also demonstrated differences in gene expression, which were  not associated with changes in DNA methylation.   In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that maternal methyl donor deficiency had a mild  selective effect on development of phenotypic changes associated with developmental  programming in the adult offspring. This study indicated that prenatal deficiency in methyl  donors programmed changes in DNA methylation in the adult offspring, but its&#8217; effect was  rather complex and largely unrelated to the observed changes in gene expression.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe: the centrality of M&#257;tauranga-a-iwi to M&#257;ori education.</field><field name="creator">Doherty, William</field><field name="description">The general aim of this thesis is to improve understanding about the place of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi in the education system. In the modern education system, the linked terms m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory are used to define M&#257;ori identity and M&#257;ori knowledge. But this thesis argues that these concepts must be grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located knowledge within tribal lands. It follows that m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, with their roots in m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, must ultimately be understood as a relationship between the tribal environment and its people. The tribal environment, or rohe, of T&#363;hoe is the illustrative site of m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi for this thesis. The rohe for T&#363;hoe is Te Urewera. The relationship that exists between T&#363;hoe and this landscape is outlined mapping this intimate relationship (chapter 2). The thesis does the work of explaining what m&#257;tauranga-a-T&#363;hoe is, and how it has developed through a series of historical engagements. These things were learned by me at the feet of my grandmother (chapter 1). The engagements include: iwi interactions (chapter 6), Pakeha and Crown engagements (chapter 7), with more recent economic realities (chapter 4), and education (chapter 5). The key concepts of m&#257;tauranga M&#257;ori, kaupapa M&#257;ori theory, and m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi, as well as being grounded in a 'real', environmentally-located base, must be viewed as inseparable strands working collectively to enhance the understanding of the other. The indivisible strands are presented in a diagrammatic form (chapter 3). By mapping the complexities of what is m&#257;tauranga T&#363;hoe (chapter 8) this thesis illustrates the level of detailed understanding that needs to be included in the education system in order for m&#257;tauranga-a-iwi and kaupapa M&#257;ori theory to be properly understood and engaged for M&#257;ori educational success.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2009.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The fisheries' trinity: re-conceptualising New Zealand's inshore fisheries management</field><field name="creator">Walshe, Kim A. R.</field><field name="description">This thesis is the culmination of 35 years of fisheries management experience shaped by reflections  and academic study.  While New Zealand is often positioned as an acclaimed success with the development and  application of the Quota Management System, this thesis outlines some of the serious flaws that  underpin current trajectories. Tensions have been created by the Ministry of Fisheries focusing  almost exclusively on developing solutions for New Zealand's fisheries policy and management  problems through the commercial sector management regime. The 'command and control' management approach sits uneasily with the 'rights-based' management regime in the commercial  fishery and the common property resource management regime in the customary Maori fishery.This study attempts to identify how the management of New Zealand inshore fisheries could be  improved by using an integrated approach -  a trinity of fisheries (institutions, rights, and  governance) to manage all three sectors (commercial, recreational and customary Maori).  The international literature provides a narrow view of fisheries policy and management in New  Zealand and the discussion is strongly oriented around a limited range of issues - particularly  commercial fisheries and a 'rights-based' approach. Drawing on a depth of experience in both  central policy development and fisheries management (particularly in the Auckland Fisheries  Management Area), four arguments are identified:  Firstly, that New Zealand's fisheries management policies for both commercial and non-commercial  fisheries management have been largely based on the commercial fishery. Secondly, that the international literature is heavily skewed towards issues and events in the  commercial fishery without adequate recognition of the non-commercial (customary Maori and  recreational) fisheries.  Thirdly, that the three fisheries in the inshore waters cannot be managed effectively unless the  management of all sectors is integrated under a common policy and management framework.  And finally, that the 'rights-based' focus is faltering because of inadequate and inappropriate  institutions and governance.  The trajectories of the three inshore wild harvest sectors (commercial, recreational, and customary  Maori) are explored, with a particular interest on how they influence and impact on each other. The  primary focus of the analysis is the role that institutions, rights and governance play on the  management and development of the three sectors.  The thesis concludes with a chapter on the current positioning of institutions, rights, and  governance within a three-sector trajectory and suggests tentative principles which could be used in  New Zealand's inshore wild stock fisheries to build an integrated policy and management. It  concludes that New Zealand's inshore fishery requires a re-conceptualisation to a governance  approach, based on ecosystem management. A common management approach across all sectors of  fisheries can be achieved by incorporating a wider institutional framework than a rights-based  approach and moving beyond a focus on harvesting alone.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dipolarity and God</field><field name="creator">Brimblecombe, Mark D.</field><field name="description">The Christian doctrine of the Trinity is about one God in three divine persons, with one of these three becoming human (without ceasing to be divine) in Jesus of Nazareth. The concept of dipolarity is about the combination of complementary but opposite principles. The most widely recognised examples of this concept are one-many and being-becoming. But what is not so recognised is that these dipolarities are clearly illustrated in the Christian doctrine of God as Trinity. By contrast, philosophers and theologians throughout history have often attempted to reconcile or synthesise these dipolar 'opposites', or to place one over the other. This quest, enshrined in Neoplatonic philosophy, has influenced the development of the Christian doctrine of God (less so in regard to the particular doctrine of the Trinity just mentioned). Divine 'Oneness' and 'Being' have often been regarded as exclusive of 'many'and 'becoming'. But the theological insight that God the Trinity is a relational and active personal being, may be contrasted with this depiction of God as singular absolute and beyond becoming. From a trinitarian foundation, a theology of God can be developed which expresses both the being-becoming and one-many dipolarities. This means revising elements of traditional Christian theism, especially in regard to understanding the eternal and unchangeable God as also becoming and many (in relation).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Theology)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/567</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Radical Difference': Wordsworth&#8217;s classical imagination and Roman ethos</field><field name="creator">Cole, John J.</field><field name="description">The subject of this thesis is the character of William Wordsworth, who is widely held to be both a poet of the imagination, and an 'exemplary' Romantic. His greatest poem, "The Prelude" had as its subject matter the growth of his own poetic mind; something that can also be understood as the growth of his 'imagination'. His friend and fellow poet, later turned philosopher, Samuel Taylor Coleridge developed a novel and romantic understanding of 'the Imagination' in the early years of his friendship with Wordsworth. He identified Wordsworth's genius, as a poet, as the product of a particularly gifted imagination, something he conceived of as an innate ability. In this thesis I challenge this 'Romantic' representation of Wordsworth's genius, one that has become canonical, largely as a result of Coleridge's treatment of Wordsworth, Poetry and Imagination in "Biographia Literaria". In making a more detailed analysis of Wordsworth's own claims about his identity, his poetic art, and imagination, I develop an argument that proposes a very different ethos to the one still largely considered normative in English Studies. The argument depends on a better recognition of Wordsworth's Classical Republican sympathies in the 1790s, and the extent to which the example of the famous Roman statesman, orator, philosopher, and poet, Marcus Tullius Cicero captured Wordsworth's imagination. Contrary to those who would romanticise Wordsworth's genius, I suggest his best work was the product of a theory of poetry based on principles that defined a very classical ideology. My argument builds on the work of recent, more detailed, representations of Wordsworth as a historical subject whose ideas were defined by particular historical circumstances, and whose identity developed out of those experiences. In addition to paying more attention to the 'historical' Wordsworth, I have also made a detailed analysis of his language, discovering the existence of a particular idiom. Wordsworth's vocabulary reflects, not only a classical humanist ideology, but also strong Stoic sentiments and an attitude of Socratic, Academic Scepticism. I trace the source of this characteristic idiom back to the influence of Cicero whose works, along with Marcus Quintilian's "De Institutione Oratoria" defined key aspects of Wordsworth's poetic theory in the late 1790s and early 1800s.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland, 2008.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5677</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speech enhancement using a small microphone array</field><field name="creator">Zeng, Qingning</field><field name="description">Microphone array based speech enhancement has wide applications. However, a  big array aperture may greatly limit its applications. The research for small microphone  array based speech enhancement has great value. Yet it is a challenging objective.  In this thesis, some algorithms and methods for small microphone array based  speech enhancement are proposed first. Then two main algorithms that synthesize the  proposed algorithms and methods are presented.  Firstly, the Multichannel Crosstalk Resistant Adaptive Noise Cancellation  (MCRANC) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm employs only two adaptive filters. It  has good stability and low computational complexity.  Secondly, three combined algorithms of MCRANC with other existing algorithms  are presented. One combined algorithm is the cascade of MCRANC with improved  spectrum subtraction. The second is the combination with delay and sum beamforming,  and the third is the combination with Weiner post-filtering. These combined algorithms  may achieve better results than any one algorithm alone.  Thirdly, four improvements are made for MCRANC itself. One is to improve  MCRANC with multichannel distorted signals filtering for its second-stage filter.  Another improvement is to employ multiple sampling rates for the array signals. The  third is to add fixed beamforming and use partial-channel processing in MCRANC. The  fourth improvement is to introduce subband processing to MCRANC.  Fourthly, two improved MGSC algorithms based on multichannel crosstalk  resistant adaptive signal cancellation (MCRASC) are proposed. One is to use every  channel of the array signal as the main channel signal and others as the referential  signals for an ACRASC to get the noise estimations. The other is to obtain the noise  estimations by establishing a shared distorted speech signal. It is proved that the essence  of the two proposed improved MGSC algorithms is to extend the common blocking  matrix to a time-variable vector blocking matrix.  Finally, two hybrid algorithms that employ several of the above-mentioned  algorithms and methods are presented. Both of them can be used for different  environments and both are suitable for real-time implementation.  For all of the algorithms, simulations and experiments are made to verify their  effectiveness.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using context to enhance students' understanding of decimal fractions</field><field name="creator">Irwin, Kathryn Cressey</field><field name="description">A total of 84 students from a lower economic area, aged 8 to 14, were interviewed about their understanding of decimal fractions. Results showed that most students could give a context in which they saw decimal fractions outside of school. The vast majority could draw a diagram of how a cake or field could be divided equally among 10 or 100 people. However, few students under 14 could give either decimal fraction symbols or common fraction symbols to represent these divisions. Less than half of the students at ages 10, 11 and 12 could visualize what might come between 0 and 1. About half of the students aged 11 and 12 could indicate what 0.1 or 0.01 meant. It was inferred that difficulty in relating these symbols to referents might be an important source of difficulty in understanding decimal fractions. Therefore, these interviews were followed by an intervention study that examined if working with contextualized decimal fractions aided understanding of these numbers when they were presented without context. Half of a group of 16 similar students, aged 11 and 12, were asked to solve problems in which numbers that incorporated decimal fractions were contextualized, and the other half were asked to solve similar problems given in purely numerical form. Students worked in pairs, on problems which incorporated common misconceptions. The group who worked on contextualized problems gained significantly more understanding than did the group that worked on purely numerical problems, as measured by the difference between pretest and posttest scores. Transcripts of the students' discussions were analysed for the effect of prior learning, aspects of peer collaboration that appeared to be beneficial to learning, and the effect of cognitive conflict. The students who gained most from collaboration were not too distant in initial expertise, showed a degree of social equity, and worked on contextualized problems. Much of students' learning appeared to result from needing to reconsider their views following a conflict between their expectations and the results of operating on a calculator or in writing, or hearing an alternative view.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, MATHEMATICS (0280)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ELEMENTARY (0524)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/57</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metabolomic analysis of the interleukin-10-deficient mouse model of Crohn's disease</field><field name="creator">Lin, Hui-Ming</field><field name="description">Crohn&#8217;s disease is an inflammatory disorder of the bowel, arising from the dysregulation of intestinal mucosal immunity. The interleukin-10-deficient (IL10-/-) mouse develops intestinal inflammation with similar characteristics to Crohn&#8217;s disease, due to the loss of immune tolerance towards intestinal microbiota. Metabolomic analysis is the study of small molecule metabolites, involving the measurement of large numbers of metabolites in biological samples. The aim of the research was to study the urinary metabolite profile of IL10-/- mice by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomic analysis. A metabolite profile of intestinal inflammation, consisting of 15 metabolites, was discovered by comparing the urinary metabolite profiles of IL10-/- and wildtype C57BL/6 mice. Xanthurenic acid and fucose were identified as the main urinary metabolites associated with the early stage of intestinal inflammation. Their levels were increased in IL10-/- mice relative to wildtype. Xanthurenic acid levels were attributed to increased tryptophan catabolism which produces kynurenine metabolites that may induce immune tolerance of T-cells towards intestinal microbiota. Plasma levels of kynurenine and 3-hydroxykynurenine were confirmed to be elevated in IL10-/- mice. The increased fucose levels may be due to abnormal fucosylation of plasma or intestinal mucosal proteins involved in leukocyte trafficking. Comparisons of the urinary metabolite profiles of IL10-/- and wildtype mice also revealed eleven metabolite differences that were unaffected by inflammation severity in IL10-/- mice. The main metabolites were glutaric acid, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid and 2-hydroxyadipic acid, which were decreased in IL10-/- mice. These eleven metabolite differences may be associated with residual genes from embryonic stem cells of the 129P2 mouse strain used to create the IL10-/- mouse, or novel functions of IL10 that are unrelated to inflammation. The metabolite profile of inflammation was not altered in IL10-/- mice fed with kiwifruit extracts, consistent with other measures of inflammation which showed that intestinal inflammation was not attenuated by the dietary intervention. The urinary levels of some kiwifruit metabolites differed between IL10-/- and wildtype mice, suggesting differences in absorption or intestinal microbial metabolism of these metabolites. Overall, the research demonstrates that metabolomic analysis of IL10-/- mice can identify potential biomarkers of intestinal inflammation and provide new insights into the metabolic effects of IL10-deficiency.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Advancing the nutrition of juvenile spiny lobster, jasus edwardsii, in aquaculture.</field><field name="creator">Simon, Cedric Johan</field><field name="description">The development of cost-effective culture systems such as sea-cages and nutritionally adequate formulated diets for juveniles is of major importance to the advance of commercial spiny lobster aquaculture. Formulated diets have the potential to improve production performance, but to date fresh mussels have consistently produced better growth than formulated diets in spiny lobsters. Reduced food consumption due to the poor attractiveness of formulated diets has been suggested as one of the reasons for the slow growth. Whether gut physiology, processing and digestion could also impair consumption on formulated diets remains to be investigated. Diet digestibility, in particular the digestion of carbohydrates included in formulated diets, is one particular area that needs further research. The objective of this thesis was to make some significant advances in addressing two major bottlenecks (i.e., rearing system and nutrition) currently constraining the commercial ongrowing of J. edwardsii juveniles. Key findings were the following: Sea-cage culture systems of the right design can provide significant growth advantages over tank culture systems, especially on formulated diets, by addressing some of the dietary inadequacies via supplemental nutrition from biofouling; food consumption on formulated diets is significantly constrained in J. edwardsii juveniles because gut throughput is reduced due to a small foregut capacity (2.5-3%), expansion of the baseline dry formulated diet after ingestion, and slow rates of foregut filling (1-2 h), foregut evacuation (10 h), faecal throughput (&gt;34 h) and appetite revival on the formulated diet (&gt;18 h); an intensified intracellular digestion of the formulated diet in the digestive gland may be responsible for the lengthy appetite revival; improving the digestibility of formulated diets appears to be essential to maximise the amount of nutrient assimilated per meal in J. edwardsii; diet digestibility can be improved significantly by decreasing the starch inclusion level and selecting particularly digestible carbohydrate sources for energy (i.e., dextrin, cooked starch, glycogen, and native wheat starch) and feed binder (i.e., carboxymethyl cellulose). Among the digestible carbohydrate sources identified, native wheat starch and carboxymethyl cellulose appears to be best utilised by J. edwardsii juveniles.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The London Prodigal': A critical edition in modern spelling</field><field name="creator">Arulanandam, Santha Devi</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a critical edition in modern spelling of The London Prodigal, a comedy played by the King's Men and printed in 1605 by Thomas Creede for the publisher Nathaniel Butter.

The present text of the play is based on the 1605 Quarto. Collation of twelve copies revealed several press variants.    The introduction treats the play's publication and stage-history and takes a critical look at its background and sources, plot and structure, setting, characters, style, themes, and role in the development of Elizabethan-Jacobean drama. An attempt is made to determine the date of composition, as well as the author. A short section is devoted to conjecture about the manuscript copy used for the Quarto and to bibliographical deductions about its treatment in the printing-house.    A full commentary glosses obscurities and enlarges on the play's literary, social, and historical allusions. There are textual notes on variants, emendations, and lineation.

Dantec, Mein langer Lauf zu mir selbst (1999) by Joschka Fischer, and Windows on the World (2003) by Fre&#769;de&#769;ric Beigbeder; and in so doing it demonstrates that these two German and two French authors combine belletrist endeavours with critical socio-political arguments in a way that corresponds to the literary form which Anglo-American writers refer to as 'creative nonfiction'. In particular, it shows that the authors recognisably share the desire to pull together critical social commentary in nonfiction form with the moral and aesthetic enterprise of the modern novelist. Current scholarship appreciates hybrid forms such as literary journalism, autofiction, nonfiction novels because they raise important formal, ethical and ontological questions. However, while they evaluate the relationship between fact and fiction in contemporary French and German writing of this kind, most scholars separate questions regarding the social merits of a text from its literary ones. This thesis adopts the creative nonfiction approach because it recognises that hybrid forms assume sharp, socio-literary positions. It defines creative nonfiction in the form of seven dynamics, which identify the distinct literary techniques that the authors use as a means to reject the constraints of weary intellectual conventions. Looking at these texts through the pluralist lens of creative nonfiction reveals that they make useful contributions to our understanding of the relationship between nonfiction and culture. Through their factual accuracy, these texts become acute documents of history and, through their literary versatility, they surpass the imaginative constraints of fact - hence this study carries the title 'Writing on the Loose'. Hybrid forms remind us that truth is an elusive concept and creative nonfiction invites us to consider this elusiveness as a valuable resource which allows us to re-imagine ourselves and our social communities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New Zealand children's experiences of stress and coping</field><field name="creator">Pienaar, Fiona Gail</field><field name="description">Children&#8217;s experiences of stress and coping have been underexplored in  comparison to studies with adults and adolescents. Of those studies that have been  conducted on children, many have utilised checklists originally developed by and for  adults or adolescents or developed for children without consulting with them. It is only  relatively recently that children have begun to be consulted about issues that concern  them. While there have been studies exploring specific aspects of children&#8217;s lives, there  is no evidence of a study that has asked children, living around a country, not in known  stressful situations, to talk about their stress and coping. There has been no prior  research of this nature undertaken in New Zealand.  This study explores New Zealand/Aotearoa1 children&#8217;s experiences of stress and  coping in their lives. A total number of 171 children, aged 8 to 12, from 29 schools  throughout the country, were invited to take part in the study. There were two phases of  data collection and the second phase included the administration of a coping checklist  which was developed out of the data from Phase One. Overall 62 participants engaged  in an individual interview and the rest took part in focus groups of primarily four children  each. Discussion was facilitated using informal guidelines and all the individual  interviews and focus groups were audio-taped, transcribed and analysed using a  Constructivist Grounded Theory methodology.  Four categories of stress and 29 stressors were identified, the majority of which  cluster around children&#8217;s two primary contexts, the school and family. The results  demonstrate that many of the challenges children identify are linked to the stress  experienced by the significant adults in their lives including their teachers but primarily,  their parents. While they could identify what their parents and other significant adults in  their lives find stressful, they were unsure, and in some cases doubtful, that adults were aware of what children find stressful or if they could identify the signs that a child was  experiencing stress. The 20 coping strategies that were identified were ordered into four  categories of coping with the primary modality being internal behavioural or cognitive strategies.  Children have explicit and articulate views on what they experience as stressful;  how they are vicariously affected by global stressors and what they perceive the  significant adults in their lives experience as stressful. Most children have a broad  range of coping strategies that they can utilise and most identified their mother as part  of their support system. There are challenges however, when stressors are experienced  in the family and children have to rely heavily on their internal coping strategies. The  small number of children, who could not identify a close family member or a member of  the school personnel as support, were noticeable in their vulnerability.  The participants provide valuable insight into the world of childhood and inform  us as to what is needed to ensure as strong a mental health foundation as possible so  that they emerge into adolescence and adulthood able to participate as fully and  effectively as possible.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling inter-ethnic partnerships in New Zealand 1981-2006: a census-based approach</field><field name="creator">Walker, Lyndon</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the patterns of ethnic partnership in New Zealand using national census data from 1981 to 2006. Inter-ethnic partnerships are of interest as they demonstrate the existence of interaction across ethnic boundaries, and are an indication of social boundaries between ethnic groups. A follow-on effect of inter-ethnic marriage is that children of mixed ethnicity couples are less likely to define themselves within a single ethnic group, further reducing cultural distinctions between the groups. The main goals of the research are to examine the historical patterns of ethnic partnership, and then use simulation models to examine the partnership matching process. It advances the current research on ethnic partnering in New Zealand through its innovative methodology and its content. Previous studies of New Zealand have examined at most two time periods, whereas this study uses six full sets of census data from a twenty-five year period. There are two key components to the methodological innovation in this study. The first is the use of log-linear models to examine the patterns in the partnership tables, which had previously only been analysed using proportions. The second is the use of the parallel processing capability of a cluster computing resource to run an evolutionary algorithm which simulated the partnership matching process using unit-level census data of the single people in the Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury regions. The European group showed a much lower rate of same ethnicity partnering than that suggested by the proportion of homogamous couples. European individuals and Maori individuals showed similar rates of same ethnicity partnering, with little change over time. The Pacific group was the only one to see an increasing tendency for same-ethnicity partnerships, whilst the rate for Asian people decreased dramatically. Individuals with dual ethnic affiliations were more likely to have a partial match of ethnicity than none at all, and there was evidence of gender asymmetry amongst some ethnic combinations. The evolutionary algorithm showed that age and education similarities were the dominant matching factors for recreating ethnic patterns. The rate of same-ethnicity and mixed-ethnicity partnerships also contributed to the matching algorithm, providing some evidence of a micro-macro link.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5823</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and theoretical studies into the laser pyrolytic formation of chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fullerene precursors.</field><field name="creator">McIntosh, Grant Jason</field><field name="description">Fullerenic materials are likely to play an important role in technologies of the future. To ensure that production techniques will be able to keep up with demand, a thorough understanding of their mechanism of formation, which has thus far proved elusive, is required. Hydrocarbon pyrolysis is a potentially viable fullerene production technique, and the pyrolysis of chlorohydrocarbons has also shown promise. However, decomposition of the latter produces toxic and environmentally hazardous chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, also formed in industrial waste incinerators, as a byproduct. Close study of the high temperature chemistry of chlorohydrocarbons may aid both the mitigation of hazardous byproducts and implementation of more effective fullerene synthesis techniques. To this end, we have studied the formation mechanisms of dichloromethane degradation products generated via Infrared Laser Powered Homogeneous Pyrolysis. This unique technique is well known for having a non-uniform temperature profile, which has a number of attractive features for this work. The most important of these are the absence of complicating surface catalysed reactions, and the potential for allowing annealing reactions necessary for fullerene growth. Time resolved product yields are monitored via GC-MS and FTIR, and mechanistic deductions are supported heavily by Density Functional Theory calculations and kinetic arguments. Results indicate that the initial growth of chlorinated compounds deviate significantly from the radical-based growth found with hydrocarbons. Facile Cl-loss in important radicals and stabilisation of carbenes by chlorine permits novel C4 and C6 production channels. Conventional channels involving acetylene addition to aromatic radicals are eventually restored in C8--C12 formation, although we do suggest some amendments to the mechanism. Bimolecular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon addition reactions may also play an important role. Acenaphthylene (C12H8) congeners also allow for the first studies of the migration of five-membered rings about chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon frameworks, a vital process in fullerene annealing; it is found that the presence of chlorine significantly stabilises transition states, suggesting these reactions are much more facile in heavily chlorinated systems.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5829</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The sea cucumber Australostichopus mollis: Juvenile feeding ecology and habitat</field><field name="creator">Slater, Matthew James</field><field name="description">The aspidochirote sea cucumber Australostichopus mollis is a commercially valuable species of research interest as a candidate for aquaculture or polyculture. Understanding juvenile habitat and feeding biology is essential to furthering aquaculture efforts and expanding knowledge of the ecology of the species. Surveying within the Mahurangi Harbour, New Zealand, revealed highly patchy distribution of juvenile A. mollis at one site within an area of high adult density. High juvenile density correlated with sediment qualities favouring epibenthic detritivorous deposit-feeding. Juvenile A. mollis showed no distinct spatial separation from adults and no association with dense macroalgae or preference for shallower depths than adults, as may be expected from studies on other sea cucumber species. Wild caught juveniles displaced to non-juvenile habitats with novel surface sediments showed rapid growth. The results indicate that the highly patchy distribution of juveniles in the harbour is not due to differences in the food quality of sediments but rather other localised effects. Juvenile A. mollis show an ability to exploit a variety of benthic sediment food sources, with growth rates comparable to other cultured species. Juvenile A. mollis exhibited positive selectivity for organic particles both in situ and in the laboratory. Juveniles exhibited an ability to distinguish between different sediment TOM levels, an ability which became limited once TOM exceeded 3%. The results reiterate the specific nutrient recycling role of deposit-feeding sea cucumbers and may help explain the patchy distribution of juvenile sea cucumbers in heterogeneous habitats. In addition the research indicates that diet homogeneity and stability will be important in development of A. mollis artificial diets while a broad range of artificial diet grain sizes will be consumed. Juvenile A. mollis fed a high rate of mussel waste diet over three months exhibited significantly higher specific growth rate (SGR) than those fed natural sediment or algal diets. The results indicate the suitability of mussel waste as a juvenile diet and show that rapid growth can be expected among juvenile sea cucumbers cultured beneath mussel farms provided sea cucumber stocking rates are managed appropriately. Bioavailability of potential artificial diet ingredients was also systematically tested for juvenile A. mollis. Apparent digestibility was moderate for common carbohydrate sources and excellent for a range of artificial protein sources including low-cost protein sources. However, growth on artificial diets was poor and diet performance may need to be improved using fermentation steps or similar before they become viable. Rapid growth and flexible feeding preferences show A. mollis to be well suited to future aquaculture and polyculture.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, characterisation and application of micro/nano structure conducting polymers</field><field name="creator">Sui, Jing</field><field name="description">Conducting polymer micro/nanostructures have recently received great attention because of their long conjugation length, high surface area and promising applications in a variety of fields. At the same time, fabrication of micro/nanostructures of conducting polymers with controlled morphology and size remains a challenge for Chemists and Materials Scientists. The focus of this thesis, therefore, is to develop novel conducting polymer micro/nanostructures with a well defined morphology and to consider their potential for applications as sensor and actuating elements. In each case, the structure, conductivity and electrochemical properties of the conducting polymer nanostructures have been characterized using FTIR, Raman, UV-vis, XPS and elemental analyses, conductivity measurements and cyclic voltammetry. Hollow nanospheres of substituted polyanilines (PANI) were fabricated chemically using ammonium persulfate as the oxidant in the presence of a polymeric acid poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic acid) (PMVEA). The effects of chemical reaction conditions, including the weight ratio of monomer to PMVEA, concentration of monomer, the molar ratio of monomer to oxidant, the reaction temperature and the type of the monomer, on the formation of hollow nanospheres were systematically studied. The weight fraction of PMVEA to monomer is particularly important for determining the size and uniform shape of the substituted PANI hollow spheres. The formation mechanism for the hollow nanospheres was studied in detail for the case of poly (o-methoxyaniline). The hollow nanospheres were used to construct a simple electrochemical oligonucleotide (ODN) sensor, where ODN probes were covalently grafted onto the residual carboxylic acid functionalities of the hollow nanospheres. Abstract II Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) hollow microspheres ranging from 0.5 to 10 &#956;m in diameter were synthesized by chemical oxidative polymerisation of EDOT using ammonium persulfate in a catanionic surfactant solution, obtained by mixing cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS). The effects of chemical reaction conditions, including the molar ratio of CTAB to SDBS, the concentration of total surfactants, the type of oxidant and magnetic stirring, on the formation of the PEDOT hollow microspheres were investigated systematically. The formation of PEDOT hollow spheres is presented as following a vesicle-templating mechanism, supported by Freeze Fracture TEM results. Moreover, the PEDOT hollow spheres showed a more effective electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of ascorbic acid, compared to conventional PEDOT granular particles, which were also effective in lowering the ascorbic acid oxidation overpotential. By extending vesicle-template method into the electropolymerisation of polypyrrole (PPy) films with para-toluene sulfonate (pTS) as the main dopant, a novel micro ring structured surface morphology was prepared by using CTAB/SDBS vesicles as templates. Spectroscopic characterisations confirmed that the micro ring structured PPy/pTS films showed similar molecular structure and doping degree to conventional PPy/pTS films, while the incorporation of some DBS anions had a minor effect on lowering film conductivity. The actuation behaviour of micro ring structured PPy/pTS films was investigated under electrochemical stimulation. The micro ring structured PPy/pTS films showed superior actuation stability compared to conventional PPy/pTS films.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics of sediment entrainment</field><field name="creator">Dwivedi, Ambuj</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5854</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of an annealing furnace</field><field name="creator">Depree, Nicholas Brian</field><field name="description">The metal coating line at New Zealand Steel relies on a large electric radiant furnace to  heat steel strip before hot-dip galvanising in a continuous process. The temperature evolution  of the strip inside the furnace is vital in ensuring the speci ed mechanical properties  are achieved for a range of steel products. Ductile products require high temperatures  su cient to cause recrystallisation of the steel microstructure, while stronger products  must be heated without causing recrystallisation. Strip dimensions and desired properties  are changed often and irregularly during operation, and these changes and associated  furnace control actions cause changes in furnace and strip temperatures and rate of heat  transfer over several di erent time scales.  Accurate control of temperature is di cult because temperature measurement devices  are strongly a ected by re ected radiation in the furnace cavity. The furnace is often  operating during transient temperature conditions, as control actions take e ect very  slowly compared to the the rate of change of operational targets. Understanding of the  transient behaviour of this system of interrelated, nonlinear variables can be improved  using modelling to calculate furnace and strip temperatures as a result of control actions  in real time, which cannot otherwise be measured or predicted.  It is shown that a three-dimensional model is capable of accurately calculating furnace  temperatures changing over both time and location, requiring minimal simpli cation of  the physical system, but is computationally expensive. Radiative heat exchange in the  furnace cavity causes signi cantly increased temperature along the edges of the steel strip,  which can cause reject product due to localised softening. It was found that furnace thermocouples  are strongly a ected by re ected radiation, so that furnace wall temperatures  be may signi cantly hotter than measured.  A simpli ed, coupled temperature-metallurgical model was shown to accurately calcui  late both furnace and strip temperatures and metallurgical changes, while the 3D model  provides understanding of e ects not explicitly modelled in the simpli ed model. The  simpli ed model is used for optimisation of furnace operational parameters, to improve  plant throughput and energy e ciency while maintaining desired metallurgical properties,  which is demonstrated by application to common products at NZ Steel.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reintegration of child sex offenders in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Russell, Gemma Louise</field><field name="description">Reintegration of child sex offenders following incarceration is most successful if  matched to the needs of offenders, victims and the community, whilst minimising risk of  recidivism and developing offenders into prosocial citizens (Austin, 2001). This study  explored child sex offenders' expectations for and experiences of reintegration into the  community. A longitudinal design was used in which semi-structured interviews covering  issues identified in the literature as being related to reintegration. Nine offenders were  interviewed within one week prior to release from prison, 3 months post-release and 6  months post-release. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Seven themes  emerged that identified child sex offenders' expectations for release that included fear of  community members' reactions, the importance of having pre-arranged accommodation and  employment, social support, relationships with probation officers, maintaining optimism for a  new way of life, and the place of cultural needs. Participants' expectations for release closely  reflected their experiences of release. Negative community reactions were encountered and  were stressful, there were problems finding accommodation and employment, social support  was important, relationships with probation officers were problematic, as was building a new  life, and there were issues concerning accountability to one's cultural group. This data  confirmed that most child sex offenders fear their release from prison into the community  and once released struggle to live in society. Overall reintegration planning was simplistic  and aimed primarily to manage risk factors rather than promote positive reintegration. Those  offenders who were most successful on release, tended to have more comprehensive  reintegration plans which enabled them to visualise what life would be like after release,  consequently increasing their optimism that they could live successfully in the community.  Recommendations are made to enhance current reintegration.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5870</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of statistical analysis techniques for developing bedforms recorded in 3D</field><field name="creator">Friedrich, Heide</field><field name="description">This study investigated the development of bedforms from a flattened sand bed to  equilibrium conditions in laboratory flumes. Experiments were undertaken in two  flumes at The University of Auckland, a narrow 11.9-m-long, 0.38-m-deep and 0.44-mwide  glass-sided open-channel flume and a wide 45-m-long, 1.2-m-deep and 1.5-mwide  glass-sided open-channel flume. A fine uniform sand with D50 = 0.24-mm and a  coarse uniform sand with D50 = 0.85-mm were used for the experiments. Flow velocities  ranging from 0.35-m/s to 0.81-m/s and water depths between 0.15-m and 0.52-m were  used.  The development of bedforms was recorded with an array of 30 Multiple Transducer  Arrays (MTAs) from Seatek. The acoustic sensors were arranged in a grid structure,  covering the centre 40% of the flume width for the narrow flume and 90% of the flume  width for the wide flume. A motorised carriage traversed the grid over a distance of  6.25-m for the narrow flume and 18.5-m for the wide flume, enabling 3D sand-bed  elevation measurements every 1-min, and 2-min respectively, resulting in quasi-4D  bedform development records.  Moving sensor measurements (47 experiments all together) were used until the  bedforms were fully developed, ranging from 2.5-hrs up to 7.5-hrs for individual flow  conditions. Recorded data post-processing techniques and general bedform development  observations are presented.  Continuous analysis tools are introduced, treating sand-bed elevations as a random field,  compared to the conventional discrete analysis methods. Continuous analysis tools are  applied to study topographical changes during the dune development in fine sand and  the 2D-3D dune transition for coarse sand.  Analysis of experiments showed that 3D ripples have on average a skewness value  similar to that for a normal distribution, with a slight negative trend. The average  kurtosis value also resembles that of a normal distribution. Conversely, 2D dunes  feature neutral to negative skewness as well as neutral to negative kurtosis. The skewness values show a correlation with the flow strength for dune beds. For dunes  developed in fine sand, both visual observations and analysis with the help of highorder  distribution moments, do not support the existence of a pronounced ripple bed  when dunes develop from a flattened sand bed. Fine sand dunes exhibit less steep  topographies than dunes developed under similar conditions in coarse sand.  A new approach to analyse 3D textures of sand-bed elevation fields is presented. 2D  structure function and 2D autocorrelation function analysis is successfully applied to the  recorded bedform data set obtained in the wide flume. It is shown that a significant trend  removal is important before application of the analysis technique. An ellipticity analysis  is introduced, the results defining analytically the restricting boundaries for bedform  development. For the wide flume experiments, the analytical results of the ellipticity  analysis show that either the flume walls or the flow depth act as a restricting force to  further growth of bedforms.  A flume comparison study between the narrow and the wide flume was carried out.  Individual experiments with similar flow conditions are compared in regards to bedform  development. It is shown that characteristic height and length values display similar  trends to discrete height and length values. Minor deviations in the definition of  saturation values and scaling regions can result in slight variations for the growth  parameters when applying the intersection technique, often even substantial variations.  The determination of parameters associated with characteristic height values seems to  be less susceptible to those problems than those associated with characteristic length  values. It is shown that dunes in the wide flume display larger height and length features  than dunes developed under the same flow conditions in the narrow flume. Scaling  relations are analysed and discussed. Equilibrium parameters of characteristic height  and length and their corresponding time parameters, are obtained for each experiment  and used for normalisation. It is shown that although the growth deviation across the  flume is substantial for wide flume experiments, once normalised, growth parameters  show a better agreement for all recorded dune development data. Double scaling  analysis is adversely affected by the difficult determination of temporal equilibrium  parameters.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value and price: a transdisciplinary approach to ecologically sustainable urban water management</field><field name="creator">Creagh, Karen Kviberg</field><field name="description">This thesis puts forward the benefits of a transdisciplinary approach to environmental  management, using urban New Zealand use and value of freshwater as a case in  point. In New Zealand, the deficiencies of urban water management have become  more evident over the last decades spurring a long process of water reform.  Changing precipitation patterns are increasing the risk of flooding events and water  shortages; there are regional and seasonal stresses on freshwater resources; and  people's attitudes and expectations are poorly understood. Existing pricing structures  are obscuring signals of both water shortages and wasteful practices.  This research examined and mapped people's awareness, perceptions, attitudes and  preferences in Auckland City and Christchurch City; two communities with different  cultural, ecological and political systems of water management. A system-based  contingent valuation method was developed to establish the level of acceptance for  including ecosystem services as a part of the water infrastructure equation in the two  communities. By eliciting a willingness to pay for water related ecosystem goods and  services, values were coupled with price and consumption. It was found that the old  mindset seeing water as a free gift from nature prevails in some communities even in  the presence of higher environmental awareness, encouraging unsustainable  consumption and potentially creating political inertia about water management  reforms.  It was found that there was a positive willingness to pay for ecosystem services in  both cities, and that motivational factors were stronger predictors than socioeconomic  variables for accepting the proposed pricing structure in Christchurch. The  systems approach developed in this thesis identified cultural-ecological city identity  constructs as having a strong potential for building community expectations for  ecologically sustainable water management. It is recommended that local water  authorities are established consisting of tangata whenua, stakeholders and experts  from social, economic and ecological fields, and to be charged with developing local  visions for water management and restoration programmes for water related  ecosystems. It is recommended that pricing should include terms for full-cost  recovery, resource rent, scarcity and investment in natural capital.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mindfulness, stress and self: an ontological shift</field><field name="creator">Fraser, Debra Jayne</field><field name="description">In this study a six week mindfulness programme is delivered to twenty nine health care professionals. Research questions address: what participants&#8217; discourse can tell us about their experiences of stress over the course of the programme, what the changes in discourse suggest that is theoretically useful to the study of mindfulness, and what an exploration of ontological underpinnings can provide to develop our understanding? And finally, whether this exploration supports a useful theory on both mindfulness and stress?  Daily diary, interview and email data is gathered on participants&#8217; discourses on stress and mindfulness. A Social Constructionist epistemology and Grounded Theory methods are used to analyse the data. Most research and commentary on mindfulness is positivist and quantitative relating to health outcomes and psychological processes. This leaves a gap in the literature that this qualitative study addresses.  A main theme in participants&#8217; discourse on stress relates to feeling overwhelmed and powerless. Participants talk of the causes of and solutions to stress and of themselves and others as &#8216;bad and wrong&#8217;. This discourse reflects a &#8216;rational self&#8217; view through the use of mechanistic, rationalistic and individualistic terms to convey experience. This &#8216;rational self&#8217; view is grounded in a Cartesian ontology or worldview. In the discourse on stress, participants&#8217; appear to view themselves ideally as rational, autonomous, non-emotional and in control.  A core social process is that with mindfulness training participants&#8217; discourse on stress changes from a disempowered to an empowered view of self. In mindfulness training participants are asked to adopt an alternative to the Cartesian conceptualisation of self. They are asked to practice I am not my thoughts and acceptance of all aspects of experience in the present moment. After mindfulness training, participants&#8217; discourse is of more calmness, peace, insight, awareness, creativity and a sense of expanded time and space. These discourses reflect an empowered view of self and a sense of agency. The discourses are compared to those before mindfulness training, and to those of the non-finishers and the stress literatures.  An alternative ontological view of the nature of &#8216;being&#8217; or &#8216;reality&#8217; and its resultant discourse has implications for stress research and mindfulness research and practice. The conceptualisation of &#8216;being&#8217; evident in the Buddhist origins of mindfulness (concepts of &#8216;no self&#8217; and experience as essentially &#8216;empty&#8217;) is not generally explored in the mainstream literature.  Literatures on stress, mindfulness and self provide a framework from which to explore participants&#8217; discourses. It appears that mindfulness programmes in the West have been uplifted and separated from their Eastern origins and rearticulated within a Cartesian ontology. It is important to address questions on mindfulness and stress ontologically to provide a broader range of options for future study, treatment approaches and practice.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5890</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Challenging perspectives: an interdisciplinary exploration of urban stormwater management</field><field name="creator">Winz, Ines</field><field name="description">Urban stormwater management must address multiple social-ecological concerns as it adapts  to present challenges and transitions towards sustainability. Concerns for physical stormwater  infrastructure must be investigated and resolved in relation to diverse stakeholder  perspectives. This research explored perspectives and barriers in urban stormwater  management and their roles in the transition to sustainability.  A dynamic simulation was developed to understand the systemic influence of  environmentally friendly solutions on water quality in receiving environments in Project  Twin Streams Catchment, West Auckland, New Zealand. Results showed that  environmentally friendly solutions can reduce but not fully internalise the environmental  impact of stormwater even in a catchment-wide implementation. Failure to integrate socialecological  variables in the modelling process limits the usefulness of the model and the  insights that can be gained. To address this, a qualitative modelling approach was undertaken  that sought to understand pluralist perspectives in stormwater management and barriers that  restrict the uptake of alternative solutions.  Cognitive mapping was used to elicit and capture perceptions on problems and solutions in  urban stormwater management. Three core perspectives were found to underlie contemporary  stormwater management: conventional fixes, low impact solutions, and community  development. These perspectives were diverse and conflicting. Conventional stormwater  management created feedback loops that promoted the continuous construction of  infrastructure to the detriment of environmental systems. Low impact solutions did not break  this feedback loop. Community development failed to address urgent issues due to systemic  delays. Importantly, none of the perspectives by themselves will lead to sustainable  iv  outcomes. This highlighted the need for integration of these different perspectives and  approaches.  Uptake of low impact solutions and community development was found to be hindered by  physical, institutional, logistical and internal barriers. These barriers were caused by, and at  the same time increased, the complexity inherent in stormwater management. Interactions  between barriers were investigated and potential policy interventions suggested guiding  managers in the development of effective policies that support the transition of urban  stormwater management towards sustainability.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5897</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Literary and empirical readings of the books of Esther</field><field name="creator">Fountain, Allison Kay</field><field name="description">This project involved a close literary analysis of the three texts of Esther. The results of the literary analysis indicated that the texts displayed different textual tendencies and also represented God, the four main characters, and some minor characters, differently. The texts were then presented to real readers for an empirical study of their perceptions of the characters. The empirical data indicate some support for the difference in perception expected from the literary analysis.    Readers of the AT considered the king to be more just, Mordecai to be more just and moral, and less dominant, and Esther to be more moral, than in the other two texts. Readers of the BT considered Mordecai more dominant than in the other two texts. For the justice of the king and the justice and morality of Mordecai they rated the BT between the AT and the MT. Readers of the MT considered the king to be less just and Mordecai to be less just and moral than in the other texts. However, for the dominance trait they rated Mordecai between the AT and BT. They also rated Esther between the AT and BT on the morality trait. Some of these effects, however, were modified by the factors of gender and religious affiliation.    The literary analysis also suggested that there is a difference in the moral reasoning level between the three texts. This was indirectly supported by the empirical study. The fact that all except one of the differences in perception were related to the character traits of justice and morality indicates that the character traits which are most obviously related to the ethics involved in the text were the ones for which real readers perceived differences.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, BIBLICAL STUDIES (0321)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--English)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/59</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Roles of biotransformation in the antitumour activity and toxicology of the hypoxia-activated pre-prodrug PR-104</field><field name="creator">Gu, Yongchuan</field><field name="description">Hypoxia is a characteristic of tumours and an attractive therapeutic target. PR-104, a  hypoxia-activated prodrug in clinical trial, is a phosphate ester which is rapidly  converted to the alcohol PR-104A, and then activated by reduction to hydroxylamine  (PR-104H) and amine (PR-104M) metabolites selectively in hypoxic cells. This thesis  explores the pharmacology of PR-104. The primary objectives were to define  relationships between metabolic transformation of PR-104, its toxicity to normal  tissues, its clearance from the body, and its antitumour activity in preclinical models.  DNA damage responsible for cytotoxicity of PR-104A was characterised by comparing  sensitivity of repair-defective Chinese hamster ovary cell lines with their repair-competent  counterparts. The activated metabolites PR-104H and PR-104M showed a  repair profile similar to typical DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, including  dependence on the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease (implicated in unhooking DNA  interstrand crosslinks at blocked replication forks) and Rad51D (required for  homologous recombination repair). PR-104A cytotoxicity under hypoxia is accounted  for by DNA crosslinking by these reduced metabolites. This study showed that hypoxia, reductase activity, and DNA interstrand crosslink repair proficiency are key  variables that interact to determine PR-104A sensitivity.  PR-104 was rapidly excreted in mice, with approximately equal excretion in urine and  faeces. Investigation of pathways of biotransformation in mice, rats, dogs and humans  identified major species difference in biotransformation of PR-104 in that N-dealkylation  and subsequent metabolites from the mercapturic acid pathway was major  in rodents, while O-glucuronidation of PR-104A much more extensive in dogs and  humans. The nitroreduction pathway was found in all species, with different patterns in  that PR-104M was prominent in rodents but PR-104H was higher in humans. Overall,  the results suggest that rodents may not be appropriate for modelling human  biotransformation and toxicology of PR-104.  A rapid and sensitive UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed for quantitation of the  major metabolites of PR-104 in humans. Application to plasma samples from phase I  clinical trials demonstrated approximately dose-linear pharmacokinetics but high variability between individuals in concentrations of the glucuronide. The species and  individual difference in glucuronidation were further examined using a microsomal  metabolism model. Glucuronidation was fastest in dog liver microsomes, followed by  human then rodent microsomes. UGT2B7 appeared to be the only human isoform able  to conjugate PR-104A, which was further confirmed by a strong correlation between  UGT2B7 protein content and glucuronidation activity in microsomes from different  individuals. The results suggest that differences in UGT2B7 activity may contribute to  individual differences in PR-104A pharmacokinetics, and that the role of this enzyme in  the toxicology of PR-104 warrants further investigation.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A thesis presented to the University of New Zealand for the Doctor of Science</field><field name="creator">Green, Rowland Alfred Weldon</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (DSc)--Auckland University College, 1953</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/5941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The transformation of Mangere Hospital: A case study in deinstitutionalisation</field><field name="creator">Levien, Janett</field><field name="description">This thesis is an analysis and evaluation of a case study in deinstitutionalisation of people with intellectual disabilities. The process has been viewed as an example of organisational change and the focus is on the relationship between formal and informal caregivers and the notion of care. Three key groups were included in the study, families of residents, the residents and staff.    A qualitative approach was taken. The theoretical perspective that was developed attempted to account for links between social movements, organisations and individual experience in the arena of intellectual disability. This was based on the approach of New Institutionalism in organisational theory. The focus was primarily on the process--of change, and in caregiving.    Three models of intellectual disability, which have informed policy and the recent changes to a preference for community care, have been identified and the links between these and the elements of organisations developed for providing care explored. The experience of families and residents within the hospital setting and then the community care setting has been examined in relation to the nature of the organisation.    Outcomes for the three groups have been examined in terms of their needs and the extent to which these needs were met by the arrangements over a given time. It is concluded that community care has the potential to better meet the needs of those involved, than has hospital based care. A number of factors in the process of change and in the delivery of care have been identified as impacting on outcomes for those involved. Consideration is given to the practical implications of these findings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT (0769)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PUBLIC HEALTH (0573)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MENTAL HEALTH (0347)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Community Health)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/6</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of brands in manufacturer-reseller relationships</field><field name="creator">Glynn, Mark Selwyn</field><field name="description">The focus of this research is on the role of manufacturer brands for resellers within retail channels. This topic is important because of the strategic value of manufacturer brands and the increasing influence of resellers within channels of distribution. Much of the branding research has emphasised a customer brand knowledge perspective, however emerging perspectives suggest that brands are also relevant to other stakeholders including resellers. In contrast channels research has recognised the manufacturer sources of market power, but has not considered the impact of manufacturer 'push and pull' strategies within channels. A comprehensive theoretical framework therefore did not exist that addressed the reseller perspective of the brand. As a result, a multi-method research design was adopted and consisted of two phases. The first phase involved in-depth interviews, from which a conceptual framework was developed. In the second phase this framework was tested by means of a survey of supermarket buyers on major and minor brands in several product categories. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the survey responses. The structural model showed very good fit to the data and good construct validity, reliability and stability. Brands have several sources of value to resellers including manufacturer support, brand preference and customer demand which influence the reseller satisfaction with the brand. Reseller satisfaction in turn influences other channel outcomes such as trust, commitment and performance. Minor brands are better able to influence trust and commitment than major brands. A key contribution of this research is the development of a validated conceptual framework on the value of the brand in inter-organisational relationships from the point of view of a reseller. This research shows that it is the resources associated with the brand, not just the brand itself that creates value for resellers in channel relationships.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Business Administration, Marketing (0338)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Marketing)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/60</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of contemporary echocardiography in the management of heart failure</field><field name="creator">Whalley, Gillian Amanda</field><field name="description">Heart failure (HF) is an increasing and leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity, hospitalisation and death. Echocardiography is often used in HF patients because it provides important aetiological, diagnostic and prognostic information to assist physician management at moderate cost. This thesis has explored contemporary echocardiographic techniques for assessment of both diastolic and systolic function to ascertain their effectiveness and optimal utility. Assessment of systolic function in HF patients is optimised by the use of harmonic imaging and not enhanced with the use of transpulmonary contrast agents, whilst diastolic filling is optimised by the use of preload manipulation. When optimised in this way, echocardiography can be used to stratify HF patients in terms of risk of death and/or hospitalisation after discharge from hospital. This was confirmed in a meta-analysis of more than 6000 patients (1000 deaths) with HF or after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), where the presence of restrictive filling pattern (the most severe form of diastolic dysfunction) was associated with a four-fold increase in mortality in both patient groups. In addition, restrictive filling pattern also predicted development of HF post AMI and hospitalisation in patients with HF. This meta-analysis also evaluated the intermediate stages of diastolic dysfunction and found a stepped relationship between each grade and prognosis. The last part of this thesis explored the role of contemporary echocardiography for management of symptomatic patients in the community and found that the diagnosis of HF in the community may be optimised by using brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) as a first test to "rule-out" heart failure and then echocardiography, which was superior to BNP in patients with intermediate BNP levels to diagnose HF. Furthermore, the systolic echocardiographic parameters were important for diagnosis, whilst the diastolic parameters predicted future hospitalisation. In summary, contemporary echocardiography in HF patients should include comprehensive assessment of systolic function (using tissue harmonics imaging) and diastolic filling (utilising preload manipulation). This approach will optimise both diagnosis and prognosis and in turn may aid physician management.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Medicine)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/61</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond responsiveness to community:  Democratic voice and the creation of an&gt;education alternative (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Carpenter, Vicki Marie</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how, in a rural New Zealand &#8216;area school&#8217;, successful democratic parental and community voice was able to bring about the creation of an education alternative. While the parental initiative was in line with the rhetoric of Tomorrow' s Schools (1988) the contention in this thesis is that initiatives such as this were not intended by the legislation. Despite the fact that the initiative was stimulated by and explicitly invoked the rhetoric, the spirit of the legislation was philosophically opposed to this particular kind of innovation.    The &#8216;Kiwi&#8217; initiative emerged in 1993, five years after the legislation. The initiative centred around a request for an alternative education programme to be set up within &#8216;Takiwa School&#8217;. This alternative was modelled on Playcentre, a New Zealand Early Childhood Education model, which encompasses aspects of progressivism. Kiwi parents and Takiwa School personnel achieved a &#8216;school within the school&#8217; for a segment of Takiwa community. Parents became fully involved in all aspects of their children's curriculum, from planning, through to delivery and assessment. This thesis examines the politics of the change process within Takiwa School.    Three questions are central to this case study examination of change. These are: What were the parents asking for? How were the parents able to achieve what they were asking for? and What were the effects of the process on what it was that the initiative ultimately became? These three questions are examined in a sociological manner, from a critical realist approach. A range of theoretical tools are utilised; the central theoretical windows are a combination of Exit, Voice and Loyalty-which is provided by Hirschman (1970)-and the theories which are encompassed in the New Institutionalist approach. The central argument of the thesis is that it was a particular combination of conditions and motivations which made the Kiwi innovation possible. The possible replicability of the initiative is discussed. A key concern of the thesis as a whole is whether the set of circumstances in which the innovation transpired was unique.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, SOCIOLOGY OF (0340)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ADMINISTRATION (0514)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/62</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of Argentine Ant (Linepithema Humile) on Arthropod Fauna in New Zealand Native Forest</field><field name="creator">Haw, James</field><field name="description">Although Argentine ant(Linepithema humile), a highly invasive ant species, has been in New Zealand for at least l4 years, little is known about their ecology and potential for invasion. Increasing spread and establishment of populations throughout New Zealand is disturbing because of the devastating impacts documented on native invertebrate biodiversity overseas. The primary aim of this study was to determine the impacts of Argentine ants on arthropods in native forest habitats in west Auckland. Pitfall traps at invaded and uninvaded sites were used to quantify ant and non-ant arthropod faunas. Argentine ants did not adversely affect native host ant communities. Moreover, two ant species appeared to be resistant to invasion. Argentine ant invasion reduced the abundance of a few orders of invertebrates while several taxa were more abundant in the presence of Argentine ants. Distribution and foraging activity of Argentine ant populations were monitored in this study from 2000-2003. Also, rate of spread was investigated to evaluate whether native forest habitats would be at risk from invasion. Measurements of foraging ant trails on monitored tree trunks revealed seasonal distribution patterns involving high activity in summer/autumn and low activity in winter/early spring. Argentine ants were found to be established primarily along the edge of the forest and did not invade into the interior of the forest during the study period. An Argentine ant poisoning operation on Tiritiri Matangi Island in January 2001 provided the opportunity to document the results of the eradication trial. In addition, pitfall traps placed at two treated sites and one untreated site were used to compare pre-poison and post-poison effects on ant and non-ant invertebrate communities. Fipronil baiting at 0.01% effectively reduced Argentine ants at the study sites and very few ants were observed in both tree count and pitfall trap recordings two months after poisoning. The invasion of Argentine ants on Tiritiri Matangi Island decimated native host ants and no recovery was detected throughout the study. Several groups of invertebrates appeared to benefit from the removal of Argentine ants while a few showed no detectable changes. Conservation implications resulting from the findings of this study are discussed Also, potential future research involving Argentine ants are outlined.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270500 Zoology::270505 Entomology</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/625</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teachers' conceptions of assessment</field><field name="creator">Brown, Gavin Thomas Lumsden</field><field name="description">Teachers' conceptions are powerful in shaping the quality of their instructional practice. The purpose of this thesis is to defend a four-facet model of teachers' conceptions of assessment, which revolves around emphasising improvement or school accountability, or student accountability purposes or treating assessment as irrelevant. Further, it explores how those conceptions relate to teachers' conceptions of learning, teaching, curriculum, and teacher efficacy.    A literature review is used to identify the major conceptions. Multiple studies led to a 50-item Teachers' Conceptions of Assessment (COA-III) questionnaire based on the four main conceptions of assessment. Structural equation modelling showed a close fit of a hierarchical, multi-dimensional model to the data. Teachers moderately agreed with the improvement conceptions and the system accountability conception. Teachers disagreed that assessment was irrelevant. However, teachers had little agreement that assessment was for student accountability. Improvement, school, and student accountability conceptions were positively correlated. The irrelevance conception was inversely related to the improvement conception and not related to the system accountability conception.    A four-factor structure of teachers' beliefs about assessment, curriculum, teaching, learning, and teacher efficacy, was found. Teachers agreed that assessment influences and improves their teaching and student learning. They agreed less strongly that assessment, measuring surface learning only, makes schools, teachers, and students accountable and that teachers are able to conduct assessment through a systematic technological approach. They agreed at a similar level with student centred learning that involves deep approaches to learning, divorced from assessment. They disagreed with a telling type of teaching that focuses only on intellectual development of students or on reconstruction or reform of society.    Use of the CoA-III makes teachers' conceptions of assessment more explicit and will assist in the development of teacher training programs, the design of assessment policy, and enhance further research into educational assessment practices. Furthermore, explicit attention to teachers' conceptions of assessment is expected to be a precursor to teachers' self-regulation of their assessment beliefs and practices.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY (0525)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, TESTS AND MEASUREMENTS (0288)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, ELEMENTARY (0524)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/63</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biophysical and Institutional Challenges to Management of Dairy Shed Effluent and Stream Management Practices on New Zealand Dairy Farms</field><field name="creator">Blackett, Paula Elizabeth</field><field name="description">New Zealand dairy farmers have been accused in a national 'dirty dairying' campaign of 'selfishly destroying the community's natural water resources' (Fish &amp; Game 2001, pg l) through a combination of point and diffuse source pollution and habitat modification. The dirty dairying debate in response to Fish &amp; Game's campaign is about the conflicts that arise through differing values of rural water resources in New Zealand. That farming practices affect freshwater ecosystems is broadly recognised but poorly understood. The problems encountered in New Zealand's dairy sector, however, are exacerbated by the nature of relationships between dairy industry actors, gaps in information and provision of environmental advice to farmers. This thesis examines aspects of the debate through scientific and social frameworks using three strongly interrelated investigations situated in the laboratory, field and social environment. Each investigation adds further levels of complexity providing potential biophysical solutions as well as insights into the challenges facing those seeking to manage the effects of dairy farming practices. Investigations focused mainly on dairy effluent and stream ecology in the Waikato and Taranaki areas. The research showed that both dairy shed effluent (DSE) dilution in stream flow and stream management practices, particularly riparian shading, were important in reducing the effects of discharges to stony stream communities. In some situations, diffuse inputs from stream management practices had already degraded stream communities, making them less sensitive to discharges. However, significant adverse effects on stream benthic invertebrates were observed for oxidation pond discharges at 338-fold and below, but not at 1000-fold dilution. Significant improvements in rural water and habitat quality are unlikely to be achieved under the regulatory regime in place at the time of the interviews carried out in this research. DSE discharges are controlled through statutory regulation, but in many cases the permitted dilution rates are too low. Controls on diffuse pollution and habitat modification are voluntary, and undertaken by some farmers. Improvements in rural water and habitat quality are constrained by a lack of clear understanding by farmers on the importance of DSE treatment and stream management practices and a lack of impetus to act. Contributing to this is limited availability, transfer and often misalignment of information between dairy industry actors involved in environmental management. However, enhanced information provision alone is unlikely to lead to improved rural water and habitat quality and Fonterra's Clean Stream Accord (May 2003), while contentious, represents a potentially effective way forward for stream management in New Zealand. Success of this Accord depends on all dairy industry actors (including farmers) working together and combining their strengths in order to generate useful, practical information and solutions to achieve improvements in rural water and habitat quality.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterization of the Plant CXE Carboxylesterase Family</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Sean D.G</field><field name="description">A large family of plant carboxylesterase genes (CXEs) has been identified, which may encode enzymes involved in secondary metabolism (among other potential functions) in higher plants. CXE family members were identified from the model plants Arabidopsis thaliana (20) and Oryza sativa (48), from the commercial fruit crops Actinidia spp. (12), Malus pumila (12), and Vaccinium corymbosum (1), plus several CXEs previously identified from a variety of other plant species. Plant CXEs share conserved sequence motifs and secondary structure characteristics with members of the &#945;/&#946; hydrolase fold superfamily. Phylogenetic analysis of the plant CXE genes distinguishes eight distinct clades. Detailed examination of the A. thaliana genome reveals that the AtCXEs are widely distributed across the genome, being present in four out of five chromosomes. Of the inter-chromosomal duplication events, two have been mediated through newly identified partial chromosomal duplication events that also include other genes surrounding the AtCXE loci. Eighteen of the 20 AtCXE genes are expressed over a broad range of tissues, while the remaining two unrelated genes are expressed only in the flowers and siliques. Four plant CXE carboxylesterases (A. thaliana CXE18, 20, Actinidia spp. CXE1, and M. pumila CXE1), representing two separate phylogenetic clades (clades II and IV), were recombinantly expressed in bacteria. The expressed CXEs were inhibited by organophosphates. Kinetic analysis with a series of 4-methyl umbelliferyl esters showed that substrate affinity for all four CXEs increases as the acyl chain length increases. Reaction efficiency of the plant CXEs is split along clade boundaries, with the two clade II enzymes preferring short acyl chain esters (acetate to butyrate), while the two clade lV enzymes prefer mid to longer acyl chain esters (heptanoate to laurate). A large number of volatile esters commonly found in plants can be hydrolyzed by these CXEs. Substrates utilized range from simple straight chain hydrocarbons (e.g. butyl acetate, hexyl hexanoate) to esters possessing more complex branched (e.g. linalyl acetate) and aromatic structures (e.g. methyl salicylate), suggestive of a spacious active site. Preliminary metabolic profiling of four AtCXE T-DNA insertion mutants reveals subtle differences in metabolite levels when compared to wildtype plants. This initial characterization of the CXE family provides a foundation for future structural studies as well as hypotheses for the role(s) these enzymes play in plants.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD-Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women's agency in the North Shore and Waitakere cities of Auckland (New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Billot, Jennie Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the ways in which women assess and seek resources in their urban contexts. I argue that the struggles of daily life in local communities and institutional groups can produce ideological spaces into which new practices, arising from increased consciousness of issues, can be developed.    My aim has been to uncover women's experiences in a way that not only interprets meanings from their practices, but also encourages such practices to be seen as valid renderings of women's understandings. I examine women's initiatives through the analysis of varying contexts. While I acknowledge the historical importance of the domestic situation as a threshold for much historic activism, women's proactivity requires a broader situational analysis. I therefore present cases of proactivity within the domestic, public and business spheres, within the two cities of Waitakere and North Shore of Auckland, New Zealand.    Through the search for new progressive social identities, women's activities at the inter-personal level are a prime source of social change. It is through the recursive relationship between women as agents and the social structure, that changing interpretations of social expectations are produced, allowing for creative activism. While women's initiatives may aim to transform particular social environments, they become part of the incremental process of change that alters the experience and structure of women's lives.    The thesis has four parts. The first outlines the scope, objectives and theoretical framework, while the second conceptualises women's agency and its positioning within social gendered structures. Part Three presents the investigative processes linking the theoretical framework and the empirical analysis. Part Four submits the thematic interpretations of the thesis, concluding that women can be agents of social change in a diversity of ways.    I acknowledge my feminist stance, one with layerings of objectives and motivations. I view women's circumstances as resulting from the interweaving of structural forces and personal capacities. The resulting awareness of women's experiences can challenge the values and concepts of masculine discourses. This is viewed through the concept of multiplicity. On a political level this means creating a resistance to hierarchies and a commitment to a plurality of voice, style and structure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">GEOGRAPHY (0366)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY STUDIES (0628)</field><field name="subject">WOMEN'S STUDIES (0453)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT (0700)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/65</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of bath/ledge  heat transfer in Hall-Heroult cells</field><field name="creator">Wei, Chuck Chenchi</field><field name="description">Heat transfer through the sidewall accounts for a significant proportion of the energy loss from an aluminium reduction cell. At the same time, the ledge formed on the sidewall has important consequences with regards to the cell service life and the dynamic heat balance during various disturbances associated with the smelting operation such as alumina feeding, anode changing, metal tapping and anode effect. Several studies have been carried out to investigate the ledge heat transfer. However, the reported heat transfer coefficients in the literature not only vary over a wide range of values but provide insufficient information on the ledge heat transfer.    A heat transfer probe and measurement techniques were developed for studying the ledge heat transfer in a full-scale 3-D air-water model. Quantitative measurements were conducted to determine the bath/ledge heat transfer characteristics at various positions, and under different operating conditions such as anode-ledge distance, current density and bath depth. Variation of the heat transfer were also examined as a function of the anode bottom inclination, the anode slot width and the position on the side ledge relative to the anode slot. The results illustrate that the ledge profile in an operating cell will take on a different shape in compliance with the heat transfer variation.    A similitude analysis was carried out to interpret the measured results in a meaningful manner for use in a reduction cell. As a result, the heat transfer coefficient in industrial cells under various operating parameters, and at different positions on the side ledge, can be estimated using the empirical correlations presented.    Gas bubble behaviour and bubble impingement on the side ledge were observed in the water model. Observations made on the 2-D and 3-D water models indicate that anode gas evolution in the 3-D model cell will reflect more closely the flow pattern in actual cells and hence provide more reliable quantitative results.    A simple 2-D thermal model for the prediction of ledge thickness and profile as a moving boundary was developed and solved simply and efficiently with a commercial spreadsheet software using the finite difference method. The ledge profile was predicted using the ledge heat transfer coefficients measured extensively from the full-scale 3-D physical model. The results show that the ledge shape is highly sensitive to the positional variation of the heat transfer coefficient. It is also shown that the ledge heat transfer coefficients obtained from industrial measurements assuming 1-D heat flow are much lower than the actual values in a Hall-Heroult cell.    A transient thermal model derived by considering the Stefan problem$/sp[*]$ for the sidewall/ledge region was developed. A fixed-grid and deforming-grid spacing were respectively superimposed on the sidewall and the ledge region in order to track the moving front of the phase change zone. Various aspects of the process dynamics with respect to the variation of ledge thickness and sidewall shell temperature were presented. The model considered dynamic heat loss through the sidewall which results in a closer approximation to the real situation. ftn$/sp[*]$N.B.: In the strict sense the problem of the ledge is not a classical Stefan problem. The classical Stefan problem involves conduction on both sides of the interface. The ledge problem involves conduction on the side and convection on the other.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL (0542)</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, METALLURGY (0743)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Chemical and Material Engineering)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/67</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New methods for analysis of epidemiological data using capture-recapture methods</field><field name="creator">Huakau, John Tupou</field><field name="description">Capture-recapture methods take their origins from animal abundance estimation, where they were used to estimate the unknown size of the animal population under study. In the late 1940s and again in the late 1960s and early 1970s these same capture-recapture methods were modified and applied to epidemiological list data. Since then through their continued use, in particular in the 1990s, these methods have become popular for the estimation of the completeness of disease registries and for the estimation of the unknown total size of human disease populations.    In this thesis we investigate new methods for the analysis of epidemiological list data using capture-recapture methods. In particular we compare two standard methods used to estimate the unknown total population size, and examine new methods which incorporate list mismatch errors and model-selection uncertainty into the process for the estimation of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. We study the use of modified tag loss methods from animal abundance estimation to allow for list mismatch errors in the epidemio-logical list data. We also explore the use of a weighted average method, the use of Bootstrap methods, and the use of a Bayesian model averaging method for incorporating model-selection uncertainty into the estimate of the unknown total population size and its associated confidence interval. In addition we use two previously unanalysed Diabetes studies to illustrate the methods examined and a well-known Spina Bifida Study for simulation purposes.    This thesis finds that ignoring list mismatch errors will lead to biased estimates of the unknown total population size and that the list mismatch methods considered here result in a useful adjustment. The adjustment also approximately agrees with the results obtained using a complex matching algorithm. As for the incorporation of model-selection uncertainty, we find that confidence intervals which incorporate model-selection uncertainty are wider and more appropriate than confidence intervals that do not. Hence we recommend the use of tag loss methods to adjust for list mismatch errors and the use of methods that incorporate model-selection uncertainty into both point and interval estimates of the unknown total population size.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">MATHEMATICS (0405)</field><field name="subject">STATISTICS (0463)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS (0308)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Statistics)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/68</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unfinished: The Seventh-day Adventist mission in the South Pacific, excluding Papua New Guinea, 1886-1986.

When that mission was finished the second coming would occur.    In 1886 following a visit by an elderly layman, John I Tay, the whole population of Pitcairn Island desired to join the SDA church. As a result in 1890 Adventist mission work began in the South Pacific Islands. By 1895 missions had been founded in six island groups. However difficulties, both within and without the mission's control, ensured that membership gains were painfully slow in the first decades of Adventist mission in Polynesia. However before World War II the Solomons became one of the most successful Adventist mission areas in the world. After 1945 Adventism also prospered in such places as Fiji, Samoa and Tonga.    Education provided the key to the gaining of accessions in a number of countries, while in others a health-medical emphasis proved important in attracting converts. Since World War II public evangelism and the use of various programmes such as welfare, radio evangelism, and the efforts of lay members contributed to sharp membership gains in most countries of the region. Of no small consequence in hindering Adventist growth was the opposition of other churches who regarded them as pariahs because of their theology and 'proselytizing'.    Adventist communities tended to be introverted, esoteric and isolationist. Nevertheless Pacific islanders adapted aspects of the usually uncompromising Adventist culture. Unity of faith, practice and procedure was a valuable Adventist asset which was promoted by a centralized administration.    After a century in the Pacific region its membership there has a reputation among other Adventists for its continued numeric growth and for the ferver its committment to Adventism. Nevertheless Adventism in the region faces a number of problems and its aim of finishing the Lord's work remains unfinished.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND OCEANIA (0332)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, HISTORY OF (0320)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::440000 Philosophy and Religion::440200 Religion and Religious Traditions::440204 Christian theology (incl.

The high prevalence of diabetes in NZ Polynesians, when compared with NZ Caucasians, after controlling for age, income and body mass index (BMI), suggest that genes may be important in this population. Therefore, the prevalence of allelic variations in the genes encoding amylin and insulin promoter factor-1 (IPF-1), and exon 2 of the hepatocyte nuclear factor-1&#945; (HNF-1&#945;) gene in NZ Polynesians with type 2 diabetes was determined. These genes are known to produce type 2 diabetes in other populations. The genes investigated were screened for mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing of promoter regions, exons and adjacent intronic sequences from genomic DNA. DNA was obtained from 146 NZ Polynesians (131 Maori and 15 Pacific Island) with type 2 diabetes and 387 NZ Polynesian non-diabetic control subjects (258 Maori and 129 Pacific Island). Sequences were compared to previously published sequences in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information database. Allelic variations in IPF-1 and exon 2 of the HNF-1&#945; gene were not associated with type 2 diabetes in NZ Polynesians. However, in the amylin gene, two new and one previously described allele was identified in the Maori population including: two alleles in the promoter region (-132G&gt;A and -215T&gt;G), and a missense mutation in exon 3 (QlOR). The -215T&gt;G allele was observed in 5.4% and l% of type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic Maori respectively, and predisposed the carrier to diabetes with a relative risk of 7.23. The -215T&gt;G allele was inherited with a previously described amylin promoter polymorphism(-230A&gt;C) in 3% of Maori with type 2 diabetes, which suggests linkage equilibrium exists between these two alleles. Both Q10R and -132G&gt;A were observed in 0.76% of type 2 diabetic patients and were absent in non-diabetic subjects. Together these allelic variations may account for approximately 7% of type 2 diabetes in Maori. These results suggest that the amylin gene maybe an important candidate marker gene for type 2 diabetes in Maori.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::320000 Medical and Health Sciences::321200 Public Health and Health Services::321207 Indigenous health</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Systematic opportunistic screening for type 2 diabetes in general practice</field><field name="creator">Kenealy, Timothy William</field><field name="description">Some 70,000 people in New Zealand may have undiagnosed diabetes. This study aims to develop &#8216;systematic opportunistic screening&#8217; for diabetes, testing people attending a general practitioner (GP) for some other reason, and to trial this process with Auckland GPs. The literature on how to change doctor behaviour is reviewed for both theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence. Two of the most promising strategies are computer reminders within a medical consultation and having patients influence doctors. Literature reviews cover GP attitudes to diabetes, guidelines and preventive care and the role of a computer in a GP consultation.    The Mail Survey (response rate 154/212, 72.6%) reports GP attitudes to guidelines and preventive care. Factor analysis showed five &#8216;guidelines&#8217; factors and two &#8216;preventive care&#8217; factors that might indicate differential motivations to screening for diabetes.    The Focus Group Study, of 35 GPs in 5 groups, discussed guidelines, diabetes and computer reminders in a consultation. The analysis suggested that GPs would respond to a patient reminder and may respond to a computer reminder to screen for diabetes.    The Screening Reminder Trial involved 107 GPs randomly allocated across four interventions: Computer reminders, Patient reminders, Both and Usual care. The main outcome measures were whether a patient who was eligible for diabetes screening and who visited a GP during the trial had a glucose test done within the trial. The trial ran for two months. Analysis was by intention-to-treat and allowed for clustering by GP. Compared with the Usual care group (screening rate 15.5%), the Odds Ratio of eligible patients being screened were; Computer group OR 2.55 (1.68-3.88), Patient group OR 1.72 (1.21-2.43) and Both group OR 1.69 (1.11-2.59). The Computer reminders were more acceptable to GPs than were the Patient intervention. The findings suggest that a simple computer reminder can implement systematic opportunistic screening for diabetes in New Zealand. If all GPs in New Zealand used the computer reminders for one year, some 8000 patients might benefit from having their diabetes treated for five years longer than they would have under &#8216;usual care&#8217;.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICINE AND SURGERY (0564)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, HEALTH CARE MANAGEMENT (0769)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--General Practice)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/7</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An anatomically-based mathematical model of the human pulmonary circulation</field><field name="creator">Burrowes, Kelly Suzanne</field><field name="description">This research develops a detailed, anatomically-based model of the human pulmonary circulatory system from the large scale arterial and venous vessels, to the microcirculatory alveolar-capillary unit. Flow is modelled through these networks enabling structure-function simulations to be conducted to increase our understanding of this complex system.Voronoi meshing is applied in a novel technique to represent the three-dimensional structure of the alveoli, and the corresponding capillary plexus intimately wrapped over the alveolar surface. This technique is used to create the alveolar-capillary structure of a single alveolar sac,  closely representing the geometry measured in anatomical studies.A Poiseuille type flow solution technique is implemented within the capillary geometry. The solution procedure incorporates calculations of red and white blood cell transit time frequencies. Novel predictions of regional microcirculatory blood cell transit in the anatomically-realistic alveolar-capillary model compare well with experimental measures.An anatomically-based finite element model of the arterial and venous vessels, down to the level of their accompanying respiratory bronchioles, is created using a combination of imaging and computational algorithms, which includes generation of supernumerary vessels. Large arterial and venous vessels and lobar geometries are derived from multi-detector row x-ray computed tomography (MDCT) scans. From these MDCT vessel end points a volume-filling branching algorithm is used to generate the remaining blood vessels that accompany the airways into the MDCT-derived host volume. An  empirically-based algorithm generates supernumerary blood vessels - unaccompanied by airways that branch to supply the closest parenchymal tissue. This new approach produces a model of pulmonary vascular geometry that is far more anatomically-realistic than previous models in the literature.A reduced form of the Navier-Stokes equations are solved within the vascular geometries to yield pressure, radius, and velocity distributions. Inclusion of a gravitational term in the governing equations allows application of the model in investigating the relative effects of gravity, structure, and posture on regional perfusion.Gravity is shown to have a lesser influence on blood flow distribution than suggested by earlier experimental studies, and by comparison between different model solutions the magnitude of the gravitational flow gradient is predicted. This study clearly demonstrates the significant role that  symmetric vascular branching has in determining the distribution of blood  flow. The influence of branching geometry is revealed by solution in symmetric, human, and ovine vascular models.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Pulmonary Alveoli physiology;Lung Physiology;Models</field><field name="subject">Biological</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Biomedical (0541)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Bioengineering)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/70</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teacher Appraisal: Missed Opportunities for Learning</field><field name="creator">Sinnema, Claire</field><field name="description">The improvement of teaching is now recognised to be a key to the sustained improvement of student achievement. Teacher appraisal, a central element of performance management, is intended to improve the quality of teaching (and therefore learning). This thesis examines whether teacher appraisal is achieving this purpose, through three empirical studies. This thesis begins with a discussion of the context of teacher appraisal in relation to education reform of the last two decades. A normative model of teacher appraisal, one that focuses on data-based inquiry into student learning, is outlined, and the emerging education context in relation to that model is examined. Three studies, which explored schools' appraisal documents, appraisal discussions and teachers' appraisal goals, are presented. The first study, a document analysis, investigated the emphasis on student learning in the statements of purpose in 17 primary schools' appraisal policies, and the emphasis on student learning in the performance indicators developed to assess teachers against the professional standards. Results showed that while improved student learning was an intended purpose of schools' appraisal policies, the indicators that were used to evaluate teachers seldom focused directly on student learning.The second study examined whether data-based inquiry into student learning occurs in appraisal discussions, and the reasons for the level of reported inquiry. Eleven practitioners (four appraisers and seven appraisees from three schools) were interviewed about their most recent appraisal discussion to investigate whether student learning was a focus of the appraisal discussions and whether student achievement data were referred to in those discussions. Findings showed that appraisal discussions typically focused on teacher practices without exploring connections between those practices and the impact they have on student learning.Only one of the eleven teachers described a discussion that included talk specifically about student learning. Furthermore, there were no reports of reference to student learning data in appraisal discussions. There was, however, a particularly positive response to the suggestion that appraisal should, and could, focus on student learning and on data relating to this learning. This study also highlighted the considerable influence of appraisal goals in determining the content and scope of appraisals. In the third study, 68 teachers from eight schools responded to a questionnaire about their appraisal goals to establish the extent to which teachers' appraisal goals focus on data-based inquiry into student learning. Less than five per cent of goals were found to refer to student outcomes. The vast majority focused on teacher processes and behaviours. Goals also tended to be vague, rather than specific, and were not explicitly challenging. Findings across the studies suggest that only limited attention is given, in critical elements of teacher appraisal, to student learning. The final chapter of the thesis explores two key strategies for closing the gap between current appraisal practices and the 'appraisal for learning' approach argued for here - an approach that focuses on teacher learning about student learning and that is based on evidence. The first strategy involves alignment within appraisal elements, and to initiatives beyond appraisal. The second strategy is capacity building to ensure that personal, interpersonal and organisational capacities necessary for 'appraisal for learning' are developed. This research shows how teacher appraisal policy and practice has been a missed opportunity to improve teaching effectiveness and how it could be reshaped in ways that maximise student learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/71</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary and secondary log breakdown simulation</field><field name="creator">Todoroki, Christine Louisa</field><field name="description">Log breakdown by sawing can be viewed as a multi-phase process that converts logs into boards by a series of cutting operations. In the primary phase, logs are sawn into s labs of wood known as flitches or cants. These are further processed by secondary operations, that resaw, edge (cut lengthwise) and trim (cut widthwise) the raw material, resulting in the manufacture of the board product whose value is influenced by its composite dimensions and quality (as indicated by a grade). Board grade is in turn determined by the number, type, size, and location of defects.    Owing to its biological origins, each log, and subsequent board, is unique. Furthermore, as each sawmill, and processing centre within the mill, has a unique configuration, the problem of determining how each log entering a mill should be sawn is very complex. Effective computer simulation of log breakdown processes must therefore entail detailed descriptions of both geometry and quality of individual logs. Appropriate strategies at each breakdown phase are also required.    In this thesis models for emulating log breakdown are developed in conjunction with an existing sawing simulation system which requires, as input, detailed three-dimensional descriptions of both internal and external log characteristics. Models based on heuristic and enumerative procedures, and those based upon the principles of dynamic programming (DP) are formulated, encoded, and compared. Log breakdown phases are considered both independently and in a combined integrated approach-working backwards from the board product through to the primary log breakdown phase. This approach permits methodology developed for the later processes to be embedded within the primary phase thus permitting the determination of a global rather than local solution to the log breakdown problem whose objective is to seek the highest possible solution quality within the minimum possible time.    Simulation results indicate that solution quality and processing speeds are influenced by both solution methodology and degree of data complexity. When the structure of either factor is simplified, solutions are generated more rapidly-but with an accompanying reduction in solution quality. A promising compromise that combines DP techniques with mathematical functions based on a subset of the original data is presented.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">OPERATIONS RESEARCH (0796)</field><field name="subject">AGRICULTURE, WOOD TECHNOLOGY (0746)</field><field name="subject">ENGINEERING, SYSTEM SCIENCE (0790)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Engineering Science)--University of Auckland, 1997.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/73</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The enhancement of intra-operative diagnostics and decision-making using computational methods</field><field name="creator">Harrison, Michael J</field><field name="description">The data presented and views expressed in this document are the result of multiple published and unpublished studies over the last 25 years. My over-arching goal in this research was to use modern computing power to create functionally useful diagnoses, in real time, from the monitoring systems used during routine anaesthesia and to present these diagnoses in an ergonomic manner. In addition it was intended to incorporate into the anaesthetic monitor, expert systems that help with the management of uncommon situations. The Australian and New Zealand College guidelines on monitoring during anaesthesia dictate those measurements that should be made during every anaesthetic; from these data evidence can be gathered, integrated, and presented to the clinician. Constraints in this field of research include the inability of the monitors to see, hear or understand the context of operating theatre activities, and computer processing time. Because many studies are involved the methods are detailed in the main text, and are not summarized here. Physiological 'envelopes' have been developed, in which the 'normal' variation in physiological variables, during anaesthesia, are enclosed. They have enabled the creation of intelligent alarm systems that can suggest diagnoses. A retrospective off-line study showed that it was possible to diagnose the onset of malignant hyperpyrexia, using fuzzy logic templates, about 10minutes earlier than the clinician. Some variables may be more important than others in making a diagnosis, and the strength of a diagnosis depends on the amount of supporting evidence, the amount of evidence not against the diagnosis and the amount of missing data. Decision-making (for example to transfuse or not transfuse blood) can also be mathematically modelled so that decision making is more consistent. Finally, investigation of the ways of displaying data indicates that the output can be very explicit. My overall conclusion is that real time decision support systems for the management of clinical dilemmas are possible. They can be instantly and easily accessible and can sit discretely in the background of anaesthetic monitors to be activated at will by the anaesthetist.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Health Sciences, Medicine and Surgery (0564)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (MD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/74</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finding the relationship that justifies egoistic concern</field><field name="creator">Weideli, Wendy Anne</field><field name="description">This thesis is a quest to find the relationship that justifies egoistic concern. I point out that what we are inclined to believe about the justification of egoistic concern, let's call it the Old Theory, is that personal identity is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, that personal identity involves a deep further fact, and that physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for personal identity.    I argue that, if personal identity involves the deep further fact, then physical and psychological continuity are not good evidence for personal identity and thus the Old Theory is mistaken. Furthermore, if the everyday egoistic concern that we have for a person who is physically and psychologically continuous with us is clearly rational, then physical and psychological continuity must be good evidence for the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, and thus either personal identity is not the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, or personal identity does not involve the deep further fact. Therefore, I suggest that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should have the following structure; some relationship, let's call it E, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern, E does not involve the deep further fact, and physical and psychological continuity are good evidence for E.    I then point out that a new theory about the justification of egoistic concern should take into account the dominant intuitions that the Old Theory was based on, but should ignore intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs flowing from the Old Theory. I argue that it is not easy to separate these two types of intuitions, but, nevertheless, in trying to find E I attempt to capture the intuitions that underlie the Old Theory, while avoiding the use of methods that might capture intuitions that are based solely on mistaken beliefs involved in the Old Theory.    After considering the various candidates for E, I conclude that psychological continuity, even if it occurs coincidentally, is the relationship that justifies egoistic concern.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Philosophy)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/75</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tupulaga Tokelau in New Zealand (the Tokelau younger generation in New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Green, Valerie Joyce</field><field name="description">Tokelauans initiated a contemporary migration from their relatively remote Pacific atolls to New Zealand around 1960 and this population movement was assisted by government resettlement schemes. The broad objectives of the ethnographic research contributing to this thesis were to study the historical context of this small-scale voluntary migration, the establishment and social organisation of culturally distinguished urban communities in North Island centres, and post-resettlement outcomes experienced by migrant and descent populations. Each of the two studies incorporated in the thesis is primarily concerned with t&#363;pulaga &#8216;the younger generation&#8217; in the New Zealand Tokelau population. One is community-based and focused on the social interactions of generation cohorts of t&#363;pulaga  and tupuna &#8216;elders&#8217;, the formal community associations and the national association of affiliated t&#363;pulaga  groups. The other is concerned with bunches of &#8220;detached&#8221; t&#363;pulaga geographically scattered throughout the country, the people without voices when research includes only the migrants in urban enclaves. Background considerations include overviews of theoretical approaches to studying the population phenomenon of migration; relevant aspects of Tokelau history and the movement of Pacific peoples; New Zealand as the receiving country and continuously changing social context for Tokelau communities, and a conceptual framework derived from features of complex adaptive systems theories that was helpful in considering aspects of the contemporary migration and its outcomes. T&#363;pulaga leaders, through the association of affiliated groups known as the Mafutaga, revived the pre-eminent cultural principle  maopoopo &#8216;gathered together and unified&#8217;, promoted a vision of &#8216;Tokelau ways in New Zealand&#8217; and supported t&#363;pulaga &#8220;becoming Tokelau in New Zealand&#8221; as residents of urban communities. Over a number of years, Mafutaga officials led the expansion of t&#363;pulaga inter-community sports meetings into a four-day national gathering of Tokelauans now celebrated as an unequivocal expression of Tokelau culture in New Zealand, and guided the established urban communities through a transition from migrant to cultural communities without usurping the political roles of esteemed elders.    The second study shows that intergenerational issues were pivotal or contributory in most t&#363;pulaga decisions to &#8220;detach&#8221; from community networks and activities. &#8220;Detachment&#8221; is categorised as transient (a provisional, not necessarily long-term status), tacit (a restorative withdrawal, with subsequent reattachment) or diuternal (a considered choice and enduring status).</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">ANTHROPOLOGY, CULTURAL (0326)</field><field name="subject">SOCIOLOGY, ETHNIC AND RACIAL STUDIES (0631)</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::420000 Language and Culture::420300 Cultural Studies::420307 Pacific cultural studies</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Anthropology)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/76</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deuteron polarization in the Be9(pd)Be8 reaction</field><field name="creator">Robinson, David Cameron</field><field name="description">A theoretical analysis of the Be9(pd)Be8 reaction at a proton energy of 333kev assuming compound nucleus formation of a 1- state in B10 predicts that if protons are unpolarised the deuterons have zero vector but maximum possible tensor polarisation i.e. the magnetic substate population ration is 1:0:1 and Pzz =1. furthermore it predicts that both the polarization and the angular distribution of these deutrerons are isotropic.

The computational framework required to produce such electrical images of the heart from non-invasive torso surface signals is presented. It is shown reliable electrical images of the heart can be obtained under a controlled environment. This has been demonstrated using an anatomically realistic boundary element porcine torso model. The procedures required to create a subject specific model using a small number of control points and to create a specific heart model from three-dimensional ultrasound images using a linear fitting procedure are presented. From discrete ECG electrodes a continuous representation of the potential field over the entire torso surface can also be produced using this linear fitting procedure. The construction of the transfer matrices for the two predominant electrocardiographic sources (epicardial potentials and myocardial activation times) are described in detail. The transfer matrices are used to compute activation times within the heart and epicardial potentials on the heart surface. Myocardial activation times are computed using an algorithm based on the Critical Point Theorem while epicardial potentials are computed using standard Tikhonov and Truncated SVD spatially regularised methods as well as Greensite's spatial and temporal regularisation method. The regularisation parameters for the epicardial potentials are determined using a variety of methods (e.g., CRESO criterion, L-curve, zero-crossing). The potential and activation based formulations are compared in a comprehensive inverse simulation study. To try and capture the dynamic and variable nature of cardiac electrical activity, the study is performed with three different types of cardiac sources with a realistic porcine model. These simulations investigate the effect on the computed solutions of individual and combinations of modelling errors. These errors include corruption in the torso surface signals, changes in material properties and geometric distortion. In general, the activation based formulation is preferred over the epicardial potential formulations, with Greensite's method found to be the best method for reconstructing epicardial potentials. Under optimal conditions, the activation approach could reconstruct the activation times to within RMS. Both potential and activation based formulations were found to be relatively insensitive to changes in material properties such as lung conductivities and activation function shapes. When examining individual errors, the geometry and positions of the torso and heart had the greatest effects on the inverse solutions. The relative heart position needed to be determined to within to obtain results within of the solutions obtained under control conditions. When the modelling errors are combined to produce errors which can be expected in a clinical or experimental situation the activation based solutions were consistently more accurate than potential based solutions. The next necessary step in this project is the detailed validation of the results against in-vivo data. This step is necessary before such algorithms can be reliably used to aid in the assessment of heart function in a clinical environment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Heart imaging;Electrocardiography;Heart Electric properties</field><field name="subject">Engineering, Biomedical (0541)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Engineering Science)--University of Auckland, 2001.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/77</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Costs and Benefits of Alternative Employment Structures: A Comparison of Employees and Contractors</field><field name="creator">Peel, Simon Mark</field><field name="description">Managers make choices regarding the types of employment structures that meet the needs of the firm, and workers make choices regarding the type of arrangement that meets their needs. Various streams of literature (for example, economics, human resource management, industrial relations, and organisational/industrial psychology) offer perspectives on why an employment relationship or a contractual relationship might be preferred under particular circumstances. However, it is often the needs of the firm that are deemed of primary importance, and it is the perspective of the firm that dominates the analysis. This kind of single perspective weakens our understanding of the employment relationship. It jacks recognition of the importance of matching the needs of the worker with the needs of the business. This thesis brings together the employer perspective and the worker perspective in an attempt to deepen our understanding of core/periphery preferences in today's labour markets. The research utilises a multiple case study design to investigate managers' decisions to use self-employed contractors or employees for particular jobs, and workers' decisions to seek or accept organisational employment or self-employment (contracting). Field research resulted in the development of seven case studies, encompassing two very different industries, and two very different groups of workers. The thesis attempts to build theory through explaining management 'analyses' of the factors relevant in the decision to employ or contract, and worker decisions to prefer employment or contractor status. In examining employer and employee 'employment structure choice', the thesis seeks to deepen our understanding of the interactional dynamics of employment relationships. It concludes that managers and workers who more carefully assess the extent to which a particular employment structure best meets the needs of both parties are better placed to build highly effective relationships.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Management and Employment Relations)--University of Auckland, 2002.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interest-based planning: The concept of interest and public urban land use system planning</field><field name="creator">Hall, Derek Rotherham</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possibility of applying the concept of interest to public urban land use system planning, although it is not intended that the idea should be limited to urban planning.    The concept is considered in detail, as is the question of who can have interests. The conclusion on that is that individuals and the public are the only true categories of interest holders, although interest groups need to be recognised for practical reasons. Corporations and governments cannot be true interest holders.    The application of the concept was assessed in relation to the subject-matter of urban land use planning, and a typical land use planning process. The possibility of applying it to a hypothetical system of planning using the pragmatic method was also considered.    The final part looked at the &#8216;institutions&#8217; of planning, that is, law, politics, professional planning, administration, and administrative tribunals, to see how they would likely relate to a planning system based on the use of the concept of interest. The conclusion was that there would be no insurmountable difficulties even If not all of these institutions would readily embrace the concept.    The idea was found to be plausible in so far as a comprehensive theory of interest-based urban land use planning was able to be worked out. By considering practical issues throughout, a strong presumption was raised that it would be feasible, although testing and further development of the idea would be necessary.    Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method were reviewed. The expected benefits were ensuring that public urban land use system planning was humanistic, and providing a concept, or theme, around which a comprehensive theory of such planning could be constructed. Likely areas of difficulty were misunderstanding due to the lack of agreement on the meaning of the concept, although the meaning that should be adopted for the proposed purpose was spelt out. Secondly, a conservative attitude towards the use of concepts other than interest in planning and related disciplines could cause resistance to the adoption of the proposed method.    It was shown how the idea is largely novel, but that recently there has been increasing use of the concept of interest in the land use planning literature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">URBAN AND REGIONAL PLANNING (0999)</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Planning)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/78</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary studies in the Podocarpaceae</field><field name="creator">Quinn, C.

FFH vegetation is found throughout the Central North Island, in locations where surrounding topography causes cold air to pool on clear, still nights. This increases frost severity and -due to the low frost tolerance of most woody New Zealand plant species - frosts are severe enough to prevent the establishment of most plant species which are common in the surrounding forest vegetation. The majority of work was carried out at four study sites. Rangitaiki is a large (c.2600 ha) remnant of FFH vegetation on a flat, pumice filled, basin. The other three study sites (Tahau, Waione and Pouakani) are much smaller (c.56 ha, c.35 ha, and c.61 ha respectively) basins where cold air is dammed by downstream river gorges. Vegetation change was examined along permanent transects established perpendicular to the FFH/ forest ecotone. Vegetation changed (over l0 - 20m) from a monoculture of Dracophyllum subulatum heathland (= FFH) to more diverse forest or scrub vegetation (= forest). A DCA ordination of the transect data showed that vegetation associations on either side of the ecotone diverged over time. That is, there was a more rapid change in the species composition of vegetation across the FFH/ forest ecotone in older sites. While seed rain density is low in FFH vegetation, it is sufficient, particularly around emergent focal trees, to allow forest to invade FFH. Frost severity increased dramatically across the ecotone in all seasons, at all sites, and the extreme ground frost minimums recorded suggest that it is low temperatures which exclude most forest species from FFH vegetation. Microclimate variation was high at all study sites, and locations with favourable microclimates in FFH vegetation were more likely to support (ephemeral) populations of forest tree seedlings. The most important determinants of variation in microclimate were overhead cover of vegetation and microtopography. The survivorship of 2,270 planted Leptospermum scoparium seedlings - a frost tolerant pioneer species which is important in forest vegetation at all study sites - was examined on transects perpendicular to the ecotone at three study sites. The most important determinant of seedling survivorship was distance from the ecotone, although the distance at which seedling survivorship dropped to zero was site and transect specific. Changes in seedling weight and height growth rate over the study period showed that many seedlings which survived the study period, would not have survived in the long term. There were no significant changes in soil profiles dug along transects perpendicular to the ecotone at all study sites. This suggests that edaphic factors are not the cause of the current ecotone position. The size-age structure of L. scoparium and D. subulatum stems in FFH and forest vegetation was examined using basal disks (n=627) collected on tansects perpendicular to the ecotone. These data suggest that the current ecotone position was set soon after the large scale disturbances which initiated vegetation associations at the four study sites. A short section of the site perimeter at the Waione study site has not been disturbed as recently as the other sites, and age structure data suggests that the ecotone at this location has been stable for at least 100 years. Transect position has no influence on the diameter growth rates of L. scoparium stems, which suggests that it is frost mortality, rather than a growth rate limitation due to lower temperatures, which is preventing this species colonising FFH vegetation. Stem age data also suggested that the scattered L. scoparium shrubs which manage to colonise FFH vegetation are killed by severe irregular climatic events, the most recent of which occurred in the summer of 1972/73. The same events probably also affected the species composition in forests surrounding the FFH study sites. Historical meteorological data suggests the most likely cause of the 1972/73 climatic disturbance was a severe summer drought, combined with a series of moderately severe summer frosts. A severe winter frost in 1978 had no observable effect on indigenous vegetation at the four study sites. The restricted distribution of two key cold tolerant indigenous woody species - due to increased fire frequency - has almost certainly resulted in a longer term dominance of some sites by FFH vegetation. Phyllocladus alpinus (not present at any of the study sites) and Halocarpus bidwilli (very restricted distribution at one study site only) have cold tolerances and life history characteristics that allow them to invade FFH. The preceeding results suggest that the composition and structure of both FFH, and surrounding forest vegetation, is a direct result of the unique abiotic environment and vegetation history of each site. Protecting vegetation covering the widest possible range of variation in edaphic and environmental conditions should therefore ensure greatest variation in different plant communities, and genotypes of different plant species, is conserved. The ecotone transitions studied in this thesis are clearly identifiable, and appear to represent the true distributional limits of most indigenous woody forest species. FFH/ forest ecotones may therefore be useful as sites for monitoring the future effects of climate change on plant communities. The varied responses of vegetation at the four study sites to the 1972/73 climatic event suggests that monitoring transects should be established at as many different sites as possible, and at different locations within each study site.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/797</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation and translation:  Towards a paradigm shift in translation studies</field><field name="creator">Ho, George</field><field name="description">Guided by Thomas Kuhn's theory about paradigm shift advanced in  The Structure of Scientific Revolutions and Mao Tsetung's theory of &#8220;the new superseding the old&#8221;, this thesis briefly examines the history of translation both in the West and in China and observes three paradigm shifts in each territory. The analyses reveal that paradigm shifts in translation theory occur when the changes in the social, economic, cultural and religious environments lead to significant changes in the practice of translation and that these changes then can no longer be adequately theorised by the old paradigms of translation. This study then critically reviews current literature on globalisation and translation and attributes its lack of depth in theorisation or some of its misleading predictions to certain scholars' inadequate investigation of the phenomenon of globalisation.    In order to provide an adequate interpretation, description, explanation and prediction of the impact of globalisation on the theory and practice of translation, I investigate five aspects of globalisation and their respective impact on translation practice and find that globalisation has changed the mainstream of translation practice from canonical translation to professional (i.e., non-canonical) translation. The findings of the research demonstrate that traditional translation theories based on comparative literary study or on linguistics fail to provide an objective and comprehensive theoretical framework for the mainstream practice of translation. Therefore, it is justifiable to posit a paradigm shift in Translation Studies from canonical translation to professional translation so as to meet the demand of and challenges for the translation profession and business under the impact of globalisation. As an initiation towards the establishment of a new paradigm, I posit a &#8220;value-driven&#8221; theory based on recent developments in researches on the global economy to distinguish between canonical and professional translations. Influenced by theories of the knowledge-driven economy, I further propose to establish a force of translators as knowledge workers to better serve the demand of the global economy and the global community. To follow the principle of empiricism, I use several case studies from the real world of commercial translation to support my &#8220;value-driven&#8221; theory for Translation Studies.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, GENERAL (0679)</field><field name="subject">BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION, MARKETING (0338)</field><field name="subject">LANGUAGE, RHETORIC AND COMPOSITION (0681)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Translation Studies)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/80</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Private speech : a window in the self-talk of kindergarten children from diverse language background</field><field name="creator">Clark, Beverley</field><field name="description">The immense potential of language, for learning, building relationships, as the embodiment of culture, for an understanding of the world and for expressing 'self', is the underlying theme of this thesis. One less apparent aspect of the language of children is their private speech. In this thesis the research questions focus on whether children from diverse language backgrounds attending English-speaking kindergartens use private speech. Further, if so, what is the context, who is present when it is used and is there a response from the person or people? These questions are primarily addressed through observations of eight children as well as recordings of their private speech. An understanding of the context is supported through interviews with the parents and teachers in the kindergartens. The expectations for this research were largely based on the work of Vygotsky, and adapted to the natural, 'free play' environments of the kindergartens. It was expected that children from diverse language backgrounds in English medium kindergartens would use private speech in their own language. While the children did use private speech (unlike the results from Vygotsky's research) they talked to themselves in English using the language that they had acquired from the community, from the media, from their experiences at kindergarten and in some cases from their families. Based on Krafft &amp; Berk's categories of private speech, a significant focus of this research is the categories of private speech that were used by individual children. These findings pose interesting insight into the experiences of the children. This research has shown the child's remarkable ability to tune into the language and culture of context and to do so not only in relation to the socio-cultural context but also through thinking and acting. This study has also provided insight into the early childhood environments and the experiences of the teachers. As the first known research into private speech/self-talk in early childhood in Aotearoa New Zealand it can serve as a spring-board for further research to enhance our understanding of the child's thinking and learning through private speech.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (EdD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/81</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Plankton of the Hauraki Gulf</field><field name="creator">Jillett, John B.

In this thesis I apply the insights of current best theory in evolutionary psychology to the problem of deciding between theological realism, which holds that religious beliefs are about some aspect of mind-independent reality, and theological non-realism, which holds that religious beliefs are mind-dependent only. The most well-known exponent of theological non-realism is Don Cupitt who bases his approach to the problem on a combination of biological naturalism and culturalism. In the first part of this thesis I show that biological naturalism and culturalism are incompatible and that culturalism should be rejected in favor of biological naturalism. Cupitt's biological naturalism is the forerunner of an evolutionary psychological approach to religious beliefs that holds great promise for determining their correct interpretation. In the second part of this thesis I critically examine the foundations of evolutionary psychology and its subsequent development into an approach to religious belief in particular.    Current evolutionary theories of culture, including religious belief, use Meme theory, which seems, on the face of it, to be a theory analogous to that of natural selection. I show that the memetic approach to religious belief is mistaken but that there is a sound alternative in the work of Pascal Boyer. Boyer draws on evolutionary psychology, anthropology and cognitive science to develop an account of the origin in the mind of religious beliefs and their spread through the population.    My evolutionary argument is that religious beliefs are the result of the current but not proper function of cognitive modules. Only if beliefs are the result of the proper function of cognitive modules are we justified in holding them to be about some aspect of mind-independent reality. Theological realism is blocked because all versions of realism in the literature depend to some degree on the fact of religious experience, which is covered by the evolutionary argument. Theological non-realism is supported, in principle, by the evolutionary argument but, in practice, is not a genuine alternative to realism because religious beliefs are automatically given a realist interpretation that competes with explicit nonrealist interpretations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PHILOSOPHY (0422)</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, PHILOSOPHY OF (0322)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Philosophy)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/82</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of individualist and collectivist attributes on responses to Likert-type scales</field><field name="creator">Shulruf, Boaz</field><field name="description">Collectivism and individualism are culturally-related psychological structures which have been used to distinguish people within and across various societies. From a review of the literature, it is argued that the most salient feature of individualism is valuing personal independence, which includes self-knowledge, uniqueness, privacy, clear communication, and competitiveness. Collectivism is associated with a strong sense of duty to group, relatedness to others, seeking others' advice, harmony, and working with the group. The purpose of the thesis is to explore how collectivist and individualist attributes affect the way people respond to Likert-type questionnaires.    In the first study, a new measurement tool for individualism and collectivism was developed to address critical methodological issues in this field of cross-cultural psychology. This new measure the &#8220;Auckland Individualism and Collectivism Scale&#8221; defined three dimensions of individualism: (a) Responsibility (acknowledging one's responsibility for one's actions), (b) Uniqueness (distinction of the self from the other) and (c) Compete (striving for personal goals is one's prime interest); and two dimensions of collectivism: (d) Advice (seeking advice from people close to one, before taking decisions), and (e) Harmony (seeking to avoid conflict). The AICS avoids the need for measuring horizontal and vertical dimensions of collectivism and individualism, and the confounding effect of familialism on the collectivism-individualism constructs.    The second study investigated the relationship between collectivism and individualism and various response sets that have been reported relating to the way in which individuals respond to Likert-type scales. Using structural equation modelling, the Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias was developed. This model suggests two types of response sets: (a) the Impression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as social desirability and context, that affect the first four stages of responding to questions, namely receiving and retrieving data and making decisions; and (b) the Expression-Response Bias which includes response sets such as the extreme response set and the neutral response set that relate to the application of the responses, namely the actual answer chosen by the respondent. Collectivism is negatively correlated with context and with self deception enhancement whereas individualism is positively correlated with context and self deception enhancement and impression management. Context is positively correlated with extreme response set and negatively correlated with neutral response set. The Collectivism-Individualism Model of Response Bias suggests that collectivist and individualist attributes directly affect the Impression-Response Bias response sets and indirectly affect the Expression-Response Bias response sets. It was concluded that attributes of collectivism and individualism affect the decision made by the respondents and therefore lead to different responses to Likert-type questionnaires. Nevertheless, the effect of collectivism and individualism on the magnitude of the responses would be limited as it is mediated by the Impression-Response Bias response set.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, SOCIAL (0451)</field><field name="subject">PSYCHOLOGY, PSYCHOMETRICS (0632)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/83</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanics and material properties of the heart using an anatomically accurate mathematical model</field><field name="creator">Nash, Martyn</field><field name="description">Global and regional mechanics of the cardiac ventricles were investigated using an anatomicallyaccurate computational model formulated from concise mathematical descriptions ofthe left and right ventricular wall geometries and the non-homogeneous laminar microstructureof cardiac muscle. The finite element method for finite deformation elasticity was developedfor the analysis and included specialised coordinate systems, interpolation schemesand parallel processing techniques for greater computational efficiency.The ventricular mechanics model incorporated the fully orthotropic pole-zero constitutivelaw, based on the three-dimensional architecture of myocardium, to account for the nonlinearmaterial response of resting cardiac muscle, relative to the three anatomically relevant axes.A fibre distribution model was introduced to reconcile some of the pole-zero constitutiveparameters with direct mechanical properties of the tissue (such as the limiting strainsestimated from detailed physiological observations of the collagen helices that surroundmyofibres), whilst other parameters were estimated from in-vitro biaxial tension tests onthin sections of myocardium. A non-invasive approach to in-vivo myocardial materialparameter estimation was also developed, based on a magnetic resonance imaging techniqueto effectively tag ventricular wall tissue.The spatially non-homogeneous distribution of myocardial residual strain was accounted forin the ventricular mechanics model using a specialised growth tensor. A simple model of fluidshift was formulated to account for the changes in local tissue volume due to movement ofintramyocardial blood. Contractile properties of ventricular myofibres were approximatedusing a quasi-static relationship between the fibre extension ratio, intracellular calciumconcentration and active fibre stress, and the framework has been developed to include amore realistic model of active myocardial mechanics, which could be coupled to a realisticdescription of the time-varying spread of electrical excitation throughout the ventricularwalls. Simple volumetric cavity models were incorporated to investigate the effects of arterialimpedance on systolic wall mechanics.Ventricular mechanics model predictions of the cavity pressure versus volume relationships,longitudinal dimension changes, torsional wall deformations and regional distributions ofmyocardial strain during the diastolic filling, isovolumic contraction and ejection phasesof the cardiac cycle showed good overall agreement with reported observations derivedfrom experimental studies of isolated and in-vivo canine hearts.

In particular, it offers a useful addition to more established techniques for dating speleothems, which not only have relevance to Quaternary geomorphology but may also carry palaeomagnetic and palaeoclimatic data. This work consolidates the method of ESR dating, with special reference to calcite speleothems, and contributes to several important aspects of the methodology. Using a low energy nuclear accelerator as a source of alpha particles of various energies, it is shown that the effectiveness of alpha radiation in producing paramagnetic defects is energy dependent, and approximately linearly related to the range of the incident alpha; the implications for dose rate calculations are discussed, and ranges are calculated for alpha particles of different energies for various dating materials for use in applying the above finding. The alpha/gamma effectiveness ratio, k, is experimentally determined for 18 calcite speleothems as k$/sb[/rm av]$ = 0.052 $/pm$ 0.006, which is significantly less than most previous estimates. The k-value for a coral sample is 0.055. By examining the Th-230/Po-210 ratios of 19 speleothem samples it is shown that for almost all speleothems, radon is retained within the sample until its decay; thus the full radionuclide decay chains should be used in dose rate calculations. Analysis of 'typical' calcite spectra confirms that interference between peaks of different origins and stability affects the estimate of accumulated dose (AD), and provides a rational basis for decisions on different sample preparation methods and analytical procedures. The effect of these on age estimates is examined and routine experimental methods recommended. The effect of different ESR spectrometer operating parameters is also evaluated and it is shown that the use of high microwave power avoids potentially serious underestimation of the accumulated dose (AD). A straight-forward statistical method is developed; this enables confidence limits to be derived for AD and provides a test for equivalence of AD estimates, using standard linear hypothesis techniques. A robust Geiger Muller instrument sufficiently sensitive to give estimates of relative gamma dose rates in a few minutes is developed specifically for cave dosimetry. It has the potential, with further development and cross-calibration, to become a viable method for measuring absolute environmental gamma dose rates. Serious discrepancies between two 'absolute' dosimetry methods are revealed; this and other problems of environmental gamma dosimetry are discussed. The evaluation of gamma dose rates in calcite (with respect to both laboratory and field dosimetry) and the form of the dose response curve (including the possibility of supra-linearity and non-thermal instability) are identified as areas requiring further research.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY (0368)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geography)--University of Auckland, 1989.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/85</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From species to languages : a phylogenetic approach to human prehistory</field><field name="creator">Atkinson, Quentin Douglas</field><field name="description">Languages, like species, evolve. Just like biologists, historical linguists infer relationships between the lineages they study by analysing heritable features. For linguists, these features can be words, grammar and phonemes. This linguistic evidence of descent with modification plays an important role in our understanding of human prehistory. However, conventional methods in historical linguistics do not employ an explicit optimality criterion to evaluate evolutionary language trees. These methods cannot quantify uncertainty in the inferences nor provide an absolute chronology of divergence events. Previous attempts to estimate divergence times from lexical data using glottochronological methods have been heavily criticized, particularly for the assumption of constant rates of lexical replacement. Computational phylogenetic methods from biology can overcome these problems and allow divergence times to be estimated without the assumption of constant rates. Here these methods are applied to lexical data to test hypotheses about human prehistory. First, divergence time estimates for the age of the Indo-European language family are used to test between two competing theories of Indo- European origin - the Kurgan hypothesis and the Anatolian farming hypothesis. The resulting age estimates are consistent with the age range implied by the Anatolian farming theory. Validation exercises using different models, data sets and coding procedures, as well as the analysis of synthetic data, indicate these results are highly robust. Second, the same methodology was applied to Mayan lexical data to infer historical relationships and divergence times within the Mayan language family. The results highlight interesting uncertainties in Mayan language relationships and suggest that the family may be older than previously thought. Finally, returning to biology, similar tree-building and model validation techniques are used to draw inferences about human origins and dispersal from human mitochondrial DNA sequence data. These analyses support a human origin 150,000-250,000 years ago and reveal time dependency in rates of mitochondrial DNA evolution. Population size estimates generated using a coalescent approach suggest a twophase human population expansion from Africa. Potential correlations between human genetic and linguistic diversity are highlighted. I conclude that there is much to be gained by linguists and biologists using the same methods and speaking the same language.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Psychology, General (0621)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2006.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/86</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspiring for unity and equality : dynamics of conflict and change in the 'by women for women' feminist service groups, Aotearoa/New Zealand (1970-1999)</field><field name="creator">Vanderpyl, Jane</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the emergence and subsequent development of feminist activist service groups in Aotearoa/New Zealand feminist movements from the 1970s to the 1990s. It specifically considers, the Women's Centres, Women's Health Collectives, Women's Refuges and Rape Crisis groups. Feminism in the groups was closely linked to the internal processes of organising as a collective based on 'women's ways of working'. The groups merged a radical feminist political orientation with a service orientation as they developed services 'for women by women'. The study was based on a qualitative analysis of published and unpublished documents of activist service groups, and open-ended interviews with 65 women discussing their experiences of working in activist service groups. Two distinct phases of change to the internal organisation of the groups between 1970 and 1999 have been identified and examined. In the first phase, (1970s - 1980s), radical feminist collective ways of working acquired the status of a taken for granted institutional norm among the groups. These groups organised as women-only collectives, utilised consensus decision-making, embodied ideals of non-hierarchy, and had aspirations of sisterhood between women. The second phase (from the late 1980s) was marked by modification of the radical feminist collective, as groups experienced internal and external pressures to adopt bureaucratic practices. Major pressures included the shift by the state to contract funding of the groups, the changing participation of paid and unpaid workers in the daily work of the groups, and the increasing formal differentiation between employers and employees. These changes were a major source of conflict and tension, as the groups modified their organisations to include differentiation of roles, specialisation of positions and formal hierarchy. At the same time groups sustained aspects of radical feminist collective organising. Dealing with differences was a major site of tension and conflict in the activist service groups. Groups implemented various strategies to address differences between women in relation to race/ethnicity, sexuality and class. A major focus of the groups was the development of bicultural relations between M&#257;ori and non-M&#257;ori. Models of biculturalrelations in the predominantly P&#257;keh&#257; groups ranged from increasing M&#257;ori representation in the groups, to the formation of alliances between independent groups or alliances between ethnic-specific groups in the same organisation. These strategies were mostly framed in terms of a binary opposition between oppressed and oppressor, and along a single axis of oppression. Nevertheless, the groups' attempts to 'deal with differences' between women were important in challenging assumptions of genderbased commonality between all women. In spite of these conflicts and associated changes, participants in the activist service groups attempted to maintain inclusive, non-hierarchical, empowering organisations 'for women by women'. In the 1990s, many of the feminist activist service groups continued to pursue democratic collective ways of working and to engage in a politics of difference in their organisations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Women's Studies (0453)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Women's Studies)--University of Auckland, 2004.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/87</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Older adulthood, education and social change (Australia, New Zealand)</field><field name="creator">Martin, Allan</field><field name="description">The outcome of demographics which point to a rapid increase in the number of older adults in the population has been widely debated in the literature. However, it has been examined primarily from the perspective of an unrealistically optimistic or unduly pessimistic view of the future, with few attempts to provide other alternatives.    This thesis is structured in three sections. The first backgrounds the context of the research question, the relevant literature, the prospect of gender bias in that literature and the historical development of government policy towards ageing. The second section presents a theoretical perspective for social change, examines the development of social movements and puts a case for a new social movement arising out of the increasing number of older adults and supporting educative processes. The third section reports on empirical research based on interviews in Australia and New Zealand with leaders of organisations involved with older adults and focuses on drawing conclusions from the research in relation to the research question.    The theory proposed in this thesis is based on the premise that an opportune time in history exists for older adults to contribute to social and political change. However, for senior members of society to undertake this role will require education in some form, to act as an agency or catalyst to initiate an organised social movement. Findings of this research support the view that the majority of older adults remain fit and healthy and do not conform to the medicalisation approach to ageing on which government policy and, to a large extent, public attitudes, have been formed. While there would be problems of organisation in the formation of a new social movement there are no insurmountable obstacles to overcome. The greatest difficulty would seem to lie in overcoming inertia, sectional interests, generating the leadership and developing innovative and imaginative educative processes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::330000 Education</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/88</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Jesus nut':  A study of New Zealand military chaplaincy</field><field name="creator">Tagg, Mary Alison</field><field name="description">Since the earliest days of the Christian Church, ordained ministers and priests have accompanied soldiers into battle. The religious presence in the war machine has been the subject of many debates, particularly those involving the conflict of ethics presented by the representation of a gospel of peace and love participating in a profession of violence and killing.    New Zealand is a secular country with a relatively well-developed system of secular pastoral care services. However the New Zealand Defence Force continues to request the churches' involvement in the military and those churches which respond continue to participate in work which appears contrary to their teaching. This study examines the relationship of church and military. It investigates the place of the church in the New Zealand Defence Force through an examination of the appropriate literature and other relevant information, and an empirical survey of the work and views of current, and some retired, chaplains.    The global military scenario has changed in recent years with the development of war technology. The New Zealand military focus is now largely directed towards policing New Zealand's economic zone and the preservation of independence of smaller neighbouring island states, while its active service role is one of participation in international peace-enforcement and peacekeeping. This thesis considers these changes and looks at the possible effects they may have on the future of military chaplaincy within the secular, multicultural context of the New Zealand state. The study concludes with a rationale for the presence of the Christian Church in the New Zealand Defense Force and presents issues which the current chaplaincy-providing churches need to consider if they wish to continue to provide effective chaplaincy for the military.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">RELIGION, CLERGY (0319)</field><field name="subject">THEOLOGY (0469)</field><field name="subject">HISTORY, CHURCH (0330)</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, GUIDANCE AND COUNSELING (0519)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Theology)--University of Auckland, 2000.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/89</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The New Zealand Greywackes:  A study of geological concepts in New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Nicholson, Heather Halcrow</field><field name="description">This thesis traces changes in geological concepts associated with the New Zealand greywackes. Since mineralogists adopted the German mining term 'grauwacke' in the 1780s to refer to a type of old, hard, grey, muddy sandstone, both the name and the rock have caused confusion and controversy. English geologists in the 1830s used the term 'grauwacke' as a rock name and a formation name for their most ancient rocks. The English abandoned the name, but 'greywacke' remained useful in Scotland and began to be used in New Zealand in the 1890s. New Zealanders still refer to the association of semi-metamorphosed greywacke sandstones, argillites, minor lavas, cherts and limestone constituting the North Island ranges and the Southern Alps as 'the greywackes'. With the South Island schists, the greywackes make up 27% of the surface of the New Zealand landmass. They supply much of our road metal, but otherwise have little economic importance. Work on these basement rocks has rarely exceeded 10% of geological research in New Zealand.Leading geologists of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries competed to construct stratigraphical models for New Zealand where the greywackes were usually classified as of Paleozoic age. Controversy was generated by insufficient data, field mistakes, wrong fossil identifications, attachment to ruling theories and the inability of European-based conventional stratigraphical methodologies to deal with these Carboniferous to Jurassic rocks formed in a very different and unsuspected geological environment. After 1945, growth of the universities, increased Geological Survey activity, and the acquisition of more reliable data led to fresh explanatory ideas about geosynclines, turbidity currents, depositional facies, low-grade metamorphism, and structural geology. New interest in the greywackes resulted in the accumulation of additional knowledge about their paleontology, petrography, sedimentology and structure. Much of this geological data is stored in visual materials including maps, photographs, and diagrams and these are essential today for the interpretation and transfer of information.The development of plate tectonic theory and the accompanying terrane concept in the seventies and eighties permitted real progress in understanding the oceanic origin of greywackes within submarine accretionary prisms and their transport to the New Zealand region. In the last half century comparatively little geological controversy about the greywackes has taken place because of the acquisition of quantities of data, technological improvements, and the use of a dependable theory of the Earth's crust. Scientific controversy takes place when data and/or background theory is inadequate.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Geology (0372)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland, 2003.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/90</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology and clinical pathophysiology of thromboembolic disease</field><field name="creator">Egermayer, Paul Charles</field><field name="description">Thrombosis is a vascular pathological process which frequently affects the veins of the lower limbs, and embolisation of thrombotic material is common. Thromboembolic disease is a common cause of death in Western societies, predominantly affecting the elderly. Numerous risk factors and co-morbidities have been identified. Safe and effective means of prophylaxis are available but are underutilised.    Anticoagulant drugs are very effective in preventing thromboembolic disease, but their effects on the evolution of the thrombotic process remain poorly documented. These drugs are difficult to use, and treatment errors and treatment failures are common.    The factors which determine the embolisation of deep vein thrombosis are poorly understood. When such embolisation occurs it is usually asymptomatic. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism presents in 3 general ways-pleuritic pain, shortness of breath, or collapse. Tachypnea is the commonest sign.    Tests which are available to assist in the diagnosis of thromboembolic disease include the ventilation perfusion lung scan, ultrasound of the lower limbs, pulmonary angiography and echocardiography. The commonest investigation requested in this context is the lung scan. Although the results are often inconclusive, this is frequently the only specific investigation which is performed. The accurate interpretation of lung scans requires consideration of the pretest probability of pulmonary embolism. The D-dimer assay is another test which may be useful. The finding of a normal D-dimer level substantially reduces the probability of thromboembolic disease and may render a lung scan unnecessary.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, MEDICINE AND SURGERY (0564)</field><field name="subject">HEALTH SCIENCES, PATHOLOGY (0571)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Medicine)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/91</field></doc><doc><field name="title">One Hundred Years of Slavery: A Sociohistorical and Demographic Study of the Origins of Cayenne Creole</field><field name="creator">Jennings, William</field><field name="description">This thesis takes a new approach to the study of the genesis of the lexically-French based Cayenne Creole, which emerged in French Guiana around the beginning of the eighteenth century.  The study begins with an an overview of theories of creole genesis that describes the various schools of thought, notably the diffusionist, superstratist, substratist and universalist positions.  Part 2 of the thesis examines the social history of Cayenne from 1650 to 1750.  It provides information about the various early settlements of Cayenne Island, particularly the Dutch and Portugese Jewish establishment from 1654 to 1664 that saw the beginning of large-scale African enslavement in the colony.  The development of the slave community in the context of the French colony is examined in detail, particularly with respect to the conditions of the slaves and their origins.  Part 3 deals with the demography of Cayenne from 1650 to 1750.  It features a detailed analysis of colonial censuses during this time, and looks at the 1690 slave list of Goupy des Marets in great detail.  The origin of the slave ships to Cayenne is also discussed.  Finally, Part 4 draws on the information provided in the social history and demography to suggest a model for the genesis of Cayenne Creole.  The validity of this model will be tested in future linguistic studies of Cayenne Creole.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--French)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/911</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Different Realities: Challenging Conventional Ways of Conceptualising Delusions and Hallucinations</field><field name="creator">Aschebrock, Yasmin</field><field name="description">Delusions and hallucinations are typically regarded in contemporary Western societies as signs of serious mental illness - that is, as essentially meaningless surface expressions of a biological process, that are almost invariably distressing and harmful to those experiencing them. However, these conventional ways of conceptualizing delusions and hallucinations are increasingly being contested (by critical psychologists and by some of those who experience these kinds of phenomena). As part of this trend, this thesis highlights the need to move beyond traditional ways of construing delusions and hallucinations and to open up new ways of thinking about them. In Part One, I present analyses from an international survey of 58 mental health practitioners and researchers, which I conducted to investigate their understandings of delusional and hallucinatory content. I explore their views concerning the importance of attending to the content of delusions and hallucinations, and a possible relation between gender and the content of these phenomena. In Part Two, I present analyses of interviews with 11 women who have experienced delusions and hallucinations. I explore the linguistic resources available to those who experience delusions and hallucinations for talking about these kinds of phenomena, and the ways in which they may attempt to make sense of such experiences. I illustrate some of the challenges to traditional ways of conceptualising delusions and hallucinations by drawing upon the accounts of five of the women I interviewed. I aim, in this thesis, to question and disrupt conventional understandings of delusions and hallucinations and to increase the availability of some alternative (marginalised) ways of construing them. I emphasise the need to consider (and critically examine) the potential practical and moral implications of various ways of conceptualising delusions and hallucinations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Psychology)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fluid-mineral equilibria in the Kawerau hydrothermal system, Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Christenson, Bruce William</field><field name="description">The Kawerau hydrothermal system lies at the northern end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, on the some 20 km south of the Bay of Plenty. The system, which is thought to have been active for at least 200,000 years, is situated over an area which has been volcanically active through time. Relatively recent local magmatism is found in the 800 m high, 3000-10,000 year old Mt. Edgecumbe dacite massif and the 200 m high Onepu Dome complex which lie adjacent to and within, respectively, the present day resistivity anomaly.    Shallow reservoir fluids show evidence of steam heating as expressed by elevated bicarbonate and/or sulphate contents and mildly to strongly acidic pH, whereas the deep fluids are dominantly alkaline at their respective temperatures. The calculated base fluid composition is comprised of 2.5 wt% CO$/sb2$ and ca. 890 mg/kg Cl at 310$/sp/circ$C.    Fluid inclusion studies show a largely stable, boiling point thermal regime through time, whereas oxygen stable isotope studies on hydrothermal carbonates prove the existence of one or more pulses of isotopically heavy fluids into the reservoir at some time(s) in the past. Hydrothermal alteration associated with these isotopic anomalies indicate strongly oxidising conditions relative to both alteration elsewhere in the reservoir and the present day reservoir redox conditions. Collectively, the data suggest a magmatic source for these transient, isotopically heavy fluids.    The present day system is ore forming, as evident from both metal rich scales formed in the production silencers of the geothermal wells and open fracture reservoir mineralogy. Stockwork environments in the deep reservoir are host to both base and precious metals, and evidence indicates that boiling is the main depositional mechanism for these ore phases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">GEOCHEMISTRY (0996)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Geology)--University of Auckland.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/94</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Human recombinant galectin-1 as a potential growth modulator</field><field name="creator">Weinberg, Cristina Simona</field><field name="description">Human galectin-1 is a soluble form of lectin known to play a role in various cellular processes by mediating recognition events in which glycoconjugates are implicated. As a number of studies have shown that galectin-1 is a growth inhibitor (Wells and Mallucci, 1991; Manilal et al., 1993), the starting hypothesis for this thesis was that galectin-1 might be a substrate for a growth-related proteinase (GRP). The intention was to identify the mechanism of action responsible for this growth-inhibitory property by looking at the effect of galectin treatment on the expression of the c-fos proto-oncogene.    The structure of the recombinant galectin-1 molecule was investigated in mass spectrometry determinations. Galectin-1 was further characterised in hemagglutination, cellular growth, cytotoxicity, proteolysis and cellular degradation experiments. Even though the recombinant galectin-1 was not identical with the natural protein because it contained two pGEX-linker amino acid residues, and had an apparently 933 Da bigger molecular weight, it fully retained the carbohydrate binding and mitogenicity properties and was still a biphasic growth modulator.    Repeated DNA sequencing and mass spectrometry determinations of the tryptic peptides have accounted for all the galectin molecule and have not detected an insertion. We concluded that the abnormal size was the result of a calibration error in the mass spectrometer.    Even though the recombinant galectin was proved to be very susceptible to soluble proteinase action, there was no evidence for its active degradation when incubated with cells, and this disproved the original hypothesis.    We showed for the first time that $/alpha/sb1$-antitrypsin inhibitor (which inhibits the GRP) had a down-regulatory effect on c-fos expression. Galectin-1 treatment of U2OS and HELA cells had a downregulatory effect on c-fos expression, which confirmed the hypothesis that this proto-oncogene is affected by the signal transduction pathway through which galectin-1 inhibits cell growth. C-fos expression is affected in HELA cells even though they do not undergo growth inhibition, indicating that this process is not as simple as we initially believed. Galectin-1 treatment also downregulated galectin-1 gene expression. This meant that feedback inhibition could take place in these tumour cells.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, MOLECULAR (0307)</field><field name="subject">BIOLOGY, CELL (0379)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biochemistry)--University of Auckland, 1996.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/96</field></doc><doc><field name="title">J.

A study (German text)</field><field name="creator">Meuser, Anneliese</field><field name="description">This study contains a detailed interpretation of the fragmentary play  Catharina von Siena by the Sturm-und-Drang (Storm and Stress) poet Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (1751-1792). Although we have only drafts of this play, the topic, the structure, and the relatively long time Lenz spent on the drama indicate that it was nevertheless an important work.    Over three chapters this study approaches the Catharina fragments in various ways, the main focus being on improving our understanding of the text. Before starting on the actual interpretation a few basic questions need to be examined, these relating to the conditions in which the play was created and developed, the choice of subject and themes, the manuscripts and their history, as well as the six editions of Catharina von Siena . For this reason the central interpretative chapter is prefaced by a chapter on the genesis of the play, as well as another chapter on the manuscripts and texts.    Since it was not possible to work with original manuscripts, a microfilm and reader print copies of the manuscripts were used. The textual examination was based on the readily available edition by Damm. Where necessary the reading by Titel/Haug and the older text editions by Weinhold, Lewy, Blei and Freye were used to supplement these, and also for the purpose of comparison.    A pluralistic methodological approach was applied. A more exact period of time for the creation of Catharina von Siena was defined, information about the way Lenz worked and about his intentions with regard to construction and effect was obtained as well. Through this detailed study of the fragments, correspondence and biographical data, we can establish reasons for the fragmentary character of the play, and are able to ascertain the special nature of the drama.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">LITERATURE, GERMANIC (0311)</field><field name="subject">THEATER (0465)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--German)--University of Auckland, 1998.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/98</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Globalisation, internationalisation and the knowledge economy in higher education: A case study of China and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Xiaoping (Isadora)</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the contemporary phenomena of globalisation, the knowledge economy and internationalisation in terms of their synergistic impacts on higher education and with special reference to China and New Zealand. Globalisation and the knowledge economy are seen to fuel each other as well as driving trends in higher education. Internationalisation is shown to be intimately related to, but conceptually distinguishable from, globalisation, and to occur partly as a consequence of the latter (and of developments in the knowledge economy) but partly also as a response to these forces. All three phenomena are addressed through assessments of their dominant economic imperatives.    As a prerequisite to understanding and critiquing these forces and their dominant imperatives, the early chapters expound a further tripartite structure, this time of political-economic theories: neoliberalism, neo-Marxism, and Giddens' 'Third Way'. The lens through which the analysis is made is explicitly neo-Marxist. The thesis critiques the ascendancy of neoliberalism in the discourse of globalisation, and the knowledge economy and the internationalisation of higher education. Neoliberalism's ascendancy is shown to be promoted through global, regional, national and sub-national entities, and this promotion is found to be often covert.    The middle section of the thesis traces the effects on higher education of the economic, and specifically neoliberal or global-capitalist imperatives that the foregoing analysis reveals. Policies of deregulation, liberalisation, marketisation, privatisation and commercialisation are shown to exert largely negative influences on universities and, by extension, on other higher education institutions. They over-emphasise the private value of both knowledge itself and higher education as a knowledge agent, something which leads to a homogenising, devaluing 'commodification' of higher education. Having made the general case, the thesis then considers the Asia-Pacific region before focusing in depth on China and New Zealand. This structure makes for a macro-meso-micro approach to the development of the inquiry but with emphasis on the macro and the micro.    Key questions raised in the thesis concern the establishment of a 'counter-hegemony' to oppose the dominance of neoliberal principles and policies. The study culminates by recommending the emergent concept of interculturalism as both an accurate description of the intersection of cultures on campus and a desirable nonnative policy which should complement internationalisation as part of national and institutional response strategies. The thesis argues for the legitimation and encouragement of neo-Marxist interculturalisation and outlines its relevance to New Zealand higher education institutions, which host many international and new immigrant students, above all from China.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">EDUCATION, HIGHER (0745)</field><field name="subject">ECONOMICS, GENERAL (0501)</field><field name="subject">POLITICAL SCIENCE, GENERAL (0615)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Education)--University of Auckland, 2005.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/99</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Marine reserves and the spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii</field><field name="creator">Kelly, Shane</field><field name="description">The impact of no-take marine reserves on spiny lobster, Jasus edwardsii, populations and the adjacent lobster fishery was assessed in a study that determined: the response of lobster populations to protection, if lobsters within marine reserves moved out into the surrounding fishery, examined the behavioural characteristic of lobsters that contributed to their recovery and spillover, and contrasted catch characteristics around a north-east New Zealand marine reserve with 2 unprotected sites. Surveys of 4 no-take marine reserves of different ages and 4 unprotected control sites confirmed that J. edwardsii increase in mean size and abundance within protected areas. Total lobster density was estimated to increase by 6.1% per year of protection. The relationship between age of reserve and the density of lobsters above the legal size limit (&gt;100 mm carapace length) was complicated by depth related interactions between reserves, due to seasonal changes in the depth distribution of lobsters and differences in the timing of surveys among locations. However, density increases in legal sized lobsters were greater than those of the overall population. Mean size of protected lobsters increased in a non-linear fashion, reflecting the asymptotic growth characteristics of the species. Mean carapace length of lobsters increased by 11.24 mm after 3 years of protection and only by 16.25 mm after 2l years of protection. Corresponding increases in biomass (kg.500 m-2) and egg production (eggs.500 m-2) were estimated to be 7.4% and 6.6% respectively per year of protection. A tag recapture program indicated that the limited scale of movements and relatively high site fidelity of mature J. edwardsii aided the recovery of lobster populations in protected areas. Of 737 lobsters tagged in and around the Leigh Marine Reserve,212 were subsequently resighted. Seventy percent of resighted lobsters were relocated less than 250 m along the shore from their initial site after a mean period of liberty of 146 (se = 13.42) days. However, seasonal offshore movements took lobsters beyond the seaward boundary of the reserve where they were susceptible to capture. Of the 521 lobsters tagged on inshore reefs within the Leigh Marine Reserve. l.9% were caught over the seaward boundary by commercial fishers, and 14.4% of the 181 lobsters tagged over the seaward boundary were resighted on inshore reefs within the reserve. Movements into or out of the reserve across the longshore boundaries were also recorded for 7 out of the 27 lobsters moving further than 250 m along the shore. Acoustic tracking confirmed that J. edwardsii have a high site fidelity, with tracked lobsters spending a median of 84% of their time at their home site. Twenty one percent of the 26 lobsters fitted with acoustic tags never left their tagging site and, of those that did leave 56% eventually returned. Lobsters moved up to 3.1km away from their home sites but managed to find their way back after periods of 1 to 103 days away. Five lobsters had strong associations with two separate sites and made repeated movements between these alternate home sites. The straight line distance between alternate home sites ranged from 200 m to 1.3 km, and the period between visits to their primary or secondary home sites ranged from 1 to 93 days. Movement activity varied throughout the year, and seasonal patterns differed between males and females. Females displayed one peak in movement activity per year, around the time of larval release in September-October. Males displayed a summer peak centred on January, and a winter peak centred on July. The onset of high movement activity was often accompanied by a shift to deeper water and l0 of the 14 lobsters tracked for over 6 months spent periods away from the inshore reef system. Exposed groups of lobsters were observed aggregating in offshore areas of sand and low lying patch reef during the day. Offshore aggregations were observed over 7 months of the year and lobsters within the aggregations displayed behaviour consistent with the use of mutual defence. The sexual composition of the aggregations reflected seasonal patterns in male and female movement rates. Male J. edwardsii dominated the aggregations in winter and summer; times when peak feeding rates of males held in captivity were also recorded. Females dominated the offshore aggregations in September-October when larvae are released. Seven of the 26 lobsters fitted with acoustic tags moved over the boundaries of the Leigh Marine Reserve and Tawharanui Marine Park during offshore movements. Despite the fact that there is no fishing access to inshore reefs within the Leigh Marine Reserve, no significant difference was detected between the catch per unit effort (kg.trap haul-1) of lobsters caught around the reserve, nearby coastal Leigh or Little Barrier Island. However, catches around the marine reserve contained fewer (P=0.0009) but larger lobsters than at Little Barrier Island. The catch characteristics of lobsters from coastal Leigh were intermediate between the other two sites. As access to inshore reefs around the Leigh Marine Reserve was limited to a small area at either end of the reserve, traps tended to be set in offshore locations and the sexual composition of the total catch around the Leigh Marine Reserve reflected the seasonal movements of males and females into, and out, offshore areas. At coastal Leigh and Little Barrier Island the location of traps was not restricted and greater use was made of coastal fringing reefs. As a result the sexual composition of the catch at these locations did not reflect the movement of various components of the lobster population into and out of specific habitats or locations. Overall, the results of this study suggest that relatively small (~ 5 km2) no-take marine reserves increase lobster biomass and egg production, without adversely affecting catch rates in the surrounding fishery. Marine reserves may therefore represent a viable management tool, which if used in conjunction with other management regimes, could provide a more precautionary approach to the management of the J. edwardsii fishery at minimal cost to the industry.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">PhD Thesis - University of Auckland</field><field name="subject">Fields of Research::270000 Biological Sciences::270700 Ecology and Evolution::270702 Marine and estuarine ecology (incl. marine ichthyology)</field><field name="identifier">Thesis (PhD--Biological Sciences)--University of Auckland, 1999.</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/2292/995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">El impacto de la guerra del Chaco en la m&#250;sica boliviana (m&#250;sica Criolla - Mestiza: resurgimiento de una identidad cultural de interpelaci&#243;n)</field><field name="creator">Cardenas Villanueva, Jenny</field><field name="description">La investigaci&#243;n musicol&#243;gica y etnomusicol&#243;gica es un cap&#237;tulo casi inexistente en el desarrollo de los estudios que sobre arte y cultura se han realizado en Bolivia .

Sustainable livelihoods approaches (SLA) are one of the latest additions to this family of approaches. As a theoretical framework and as a set of principles for guiding intervention, sustainable livelihoods thinking has implications for development management. Drawing on research exploring the application of sustainable livelihoods principles in ten development interventions, this paper considers how these principles have evolved from continuing debates surrounding process and people-centred (bottom-up) approaches to development management. This research suggests that whilst these principles can improve the impact made by interventions, the effective application of sustainable livelihoods and other process approaches are fundamentally restricted by unbalanced power relationships between development partners.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation">http://www.brad.ac.uk/acad/des/research/papers/ResearchPaper10Toner.pdf</field><field name="subject">Development interventions</field><field name="subject">Sustainable livelihoods approaches</field><field name="identifier">Mdee, A. and Franks, T.

The state-of-the-art of first principle calculations of optical absorption of solids has been represented, up to recently, by the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approach. The results one can achieve within BSE are in good agreement with experiments and, moreover, the range of applicability of BSE goes well beyond the solids. Absorption spectra of atoms, molecules, clusters or surfaces are usually well described by the Bethe-Salpeter approach. The heaviness of the calculations involved, however, prevents a large-scale application to more complex systems, that are the systems of great interest in material science like, e.g., quantum dots, multi-wall nanotubes, biological molecules or defects in solids. The most prominent alternative to the Bethe-Salpeter approach is the Time Dependent Density Functional Theory, which is density-based and, therefore, could in principle lead to simpler calculations. A widely used approximation to the TDDFT is the adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA). Despite its (partial) success in finite systems the ALDA has led to poor results in the description of optical absorption of solids. The search for an efficient description of optical spectra of solids in TDDFT has become, hence, one of the major problems related to the optical response of a material. In this thesis new inroads have been made in the comprehension of the optical response of a material. Starting from a joint analysis of the BSE approach and the TDDFT framework, it has been possible to calculate the optical spectra of solids, semiconductors and insulators, with the inclusion of the excitonic effects, without solving the BSE but obtaining results of the same precision. To do so, we have derived, or re-derived in a more general way, the most relevant formulas, and implemented them in existing computer codes.7 In order to increase the efficiency and the stability of the calculations, the codes have also been optimized, and, in particular, a linear solver technique has been implemented to avoid all matrix inversions. A large number of calculations for a detailed analysis of the models used and for all hypotheses made, had then to be performed. Finally we have illustrated our findings for bulk silicon, silicon carbide, and solid argon. More in detail, after the theoretical framework, presented in chapters 1-4, &#8226; In chapter 5 we have recalled the fact that TDDFT and BSE have the same mathematical structure, and that the response function in both approaches can be written as S = S0 + S0KS whose solution gives the searched absorption or energy loss spectrum. The link between the response of an independent particle (or quasi-particle) system S0 and the full response S is given by the kernel K in this Dyson-like screening equation. The kernel K contains the Coulomb interaction v, which is common to both TDDFT and BSE, and the exchange-correlation (in TDDFT) or electron-hole (BSE) contribution, which is instead different in the two approaches. &#8226; The role of the Coulomb potential v has been elucidated in chapter 6. We have discussed its long-range component v0, which is responsible for the difference between the absorption and the electron energy loss spectra in solids. To further illustrate this result, we have shown, analytically and numerically that, in the limit of an isolated system, where the long-range component of the Coulomb interaction is negligible, the absorption and the electron energy-loss (at vanishing momentum transfer) spectra are the same. The microscopic components of the Coulomb interaction, instead, are responsible for the local field effects. &#8226; We have then addressed the second term of the kernel K, namely the exchangecorrelation kernel fxc (in TDDFT). The study made in chapter 7 has allowed us to show that simple static approximations for the exchange-correlation kernel fxc can yield spectra of semiconductors and insulators in qualitative agreement with the experiments. &#8226; In chapter 8 we have generalized a previously proposed, but never tested, expression for an exchange-correlation kernel fxc, within the time dependent density functional theory framework, which is fully ab initio and parameter-free. We have also investigated the different contributions to the kernel and found out how and when the generalized kernel 0fxc0 works in principle. &#8226; In chapter 9 the kernel here developed is applied and tested for two semiconductors, namely bulk silicon and silicon carbide, while &#8226; in chapter 10 the kernel is tested for an insulator, taking solid argon as an example. In both semiconductors and insulators the results of the TDDFT (using the kernel developed in chapter 8) and those of BSE are almost indistinguishable. We have hence contributed to the solution of the long-standing problem of how to calculate the absorption spectra of solids, in the framework of TDDFT, without solving the BSE. To have dealt with this problem, has allowed us to address, answer or simply illustrate several questions: ! classical Coulomb (Hartree) contributions play an important role in electronic spectra, and it is worthwhile to discuss their effects before addressing the problems of exchange and correlation. Their short-range and long-range parts are crucial for understanding the link between absorption and energy loss, and the transition between finite and infinite systems. ! satisfactory optical spectra of semiconductors and insulators can be obtained by using very simple models for the electron-hole interaction (in BSE) or for the exchangecorrelation kernel (in TDDFT); these models, of course, depend on parameters that one has to adjust to fit the experiment. However the computational complexity of these calculations is that of the RPA, and one might try to find ways to determine these parameters from first principles; ! to obtain an exchange-correlation kernel from the BSE is not straightforward. However, apart from some counter examples, discussed in chapter 8, in most cases an approximate mapping from one theory (the BSE) to the other (the TDDFT) is possible. A first consequence of the existing difficulties is that the resulting fxc kernel can suffer of convergence problem (requiring a lot of G-vectors or presenting strong fluctuations in frequency). There can also be several possible approximate mappings: an example is reported in chapter 7 where two exchange-correlations kernels, a long-range and an ultra short-range one, give similar (good) results. These two kernels are derived starting from the same model (the contact exciton model) within the BSE; ! an important finding, following the discussions of chapter 8, is that the key quantity of the theory is not the kernel fxc, but fxc multiplied by a response function; ! finally, we are now able to obtain very good results for the optical spectra of solids, well describing both the continuum and bound excitons, within a parameter-free TDDFT framework. Future Developments The thesis focused on the description of optical spectra of solids, in the appealing framework of TDDFT. However the concepts and approaches here developed have to be ex-tended in order to improve their applicability and &#8220;workability&#8221;. Concerning the latter, we will have to search for the most convenient algorithm to numerically evaluate the proposed expressions. We also plan to take advantage of the fact that, in our formulation, k-points are simply summed over, instead of being the indices of matrices that have to be inverted or diagonalized. Concerning the applications, a short term perspective is to apply the method to the description of the electron energy loss spectra, for which the resonant and anti-resonant part of the response function have to be taken into account. We also plan to study finite systems. Moreover the introduction of the spin degree of freedom could allow to enlarge the target of our study, towards polarised systems, both finite and infinite, also subject to magnetic fields.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[PHYS] Physics</field><field name="subject">Mati&#232;re condens&#233;e</field><field name="subject">Structure &#233;lectronique</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00000739/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/50/33/43/PDF/Tesi_dot.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processus de L&#233;vy et applications en finance : probl&#232;mes inverses et mod&#233;lisation de la d&#233;pendance.</field><field name="creator">Tankov, Peter</field><field name="description">Cette th&#232;se traite de la mod&#233;lisation de prix boursiers par les exponentielles de processus de L&#233;vy.

Produits d'une &#233;volution culturelle rapide, qui a pris le pas sur l'&#233;volution biologique, celles-ci r&#233;clament une approche par des formalismes radicalement diff&#233;rents de ceux utilis&#233;s g&#233;n&#233;ralement dans l'&#233;tude des autres soci&#233;t&#233;s animales. Concr&#232;tement, la mod&#233;lisation des rapports entre individus et collectif consid&#232;re le plus souvent des agents qui peuvent &#234;tre repr&#233;sent&#233;s sous la forme d'une hi&#233;rarchie de r&#232;gles, chacune se pla&#231;ant en position m&#233;ta par rapport aux r&#232;gles du niveau inf&#233;rieur. Celles-ci peuvent s'interpr&#233;ter, selon les niveaux, comme des r&#232;gles de comportement, des r&#232;gles de d&#233;cision, des r&#232;gles de transmission culturelle ou g&#233;n&#233;tique. L'&#233;mergence de r&#233;gularit&#233;s au niveau collectif peut alors s'interpr&#233;ter comme la s&#233;lection d'une distribution particuli&#232;re sur l'ensemble des r&#232;gles et m&#233;tar&#232;gles d&#233;finissant les agents. D&#232;s lors, le probl&#232;me de l'auto-organisation dans les syst&#232;mes &#233;conomiques et sociaux se reformule autour de la question suivante : &#171; Peut-on endog&#233;n&#233;iser les distributions des m&#233;tar&#232;gles de comportement de mani&#232;re &#224; ce qu'elles soient le produit des dynamiques collectives qu'elles d&#233;finissent ? &#187;.

Nous proposons ainsi un cadre formel pour l'&#233;tude de soci&#233;t&#233;s d'agents mim&#233;tiques auto-organis&#233;es, les jeux m&#233;tamim&#233;tiques ; le concept d'&#233;quilibre correspondant est alors l'&#233;tat contrefactuellement stable : aucun agent ne peut s'imaginer mieux qu'il n'est en se mettant contrefactuellement &#224; la place de l'un de ses voisins. Nous &#233;tudions ensuite les propri&#233;t&#233;s de ces jeux en prenant comme champs d'application le probl&#232;me de l'&#233;mergence de la coop&#233;ration dans un dilemme de prisonnier spatialis&#233;.

L'acier de l'&#233;tude i.e. l'acier 9Cr1Mo-NbV est d&#233;j&#224; utilis&#233; dans des centrales thermiques principalement en Angleterre et au Japon.

L'attention a ensuite &#233;t&#233; port&#233;e &#224; la tenue en fluage des composants soud&#233;s qui pr&#233;sentent une r&#233;sistance au fluage tr&#232;s inf&#233;rieure &#224; celle du m&#233;tal de base due &#224; la faiblesse de la zone affect&#233;e thermiquement (ZAT). Pour ce faire, deux niveaux d'investigation ont du &#234;tre explor&#233;s. D'une part, le soudage induit des modifications m&#233;tallurgiques et donc des modifications locales des propri&#233;t&#233;s m&#233;caniques du m&#233;tal de base: c'est un effet mat&#233;riau. D'autre part, les diff&#233;rences de propri&#233;t&#233;s m&#233;caniques rendent complexes l'&#233;tat de chargement de l'assemblage soud&#233;: c'est un effet de structure. L'effet mat&#233;riau a &#233;t&#233; &#233;tudi&#233; en identifiant la ZAT faible des composants soud&#233;s, en la reproduisant sur &#233;chantillons massifs, puis en testant des &#233;prouvettes de fluage usin&#233;es dans ces m&#234;mes &#233;chantillons massifs. Il a &#233;t&#233; ainsi possible d'utiliser le mod&#232;le multi-m&#233;canismes d&#233;velopp&#233; pour l'&#233;tude sur m&#233;tal de base afin de mod&#233;liser le comportement et l'endommagement de fluage haute temp&#233;rature de la ZAT faible dans toute la gamme de contrainte. Finalement, des calculs &#233;l&#233;ments finis multi-mat&#233;riaux ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;alis&#233;s en consid&#233;rant le composant soud&#233; comme l'assemblage de trois microstructures: le m&#233;tal d'apport, le m&#233;tal de base et la ZAT faible dont les &#233;quations constitutives respectives ont &#233;t&#233; int&#233;gr&#233;es aux calculs.

Sa d&#233;finition, datant de 1901, se trouve limit&#233;e par la stabilit&#233; du mat&#233;riau formant le prototype international. Des d&#233;rives allant jusqu'&#224; 2 &#956;g par an sont d'ailleurs observ&#233;es au niveau des copies du prototype international en platine iridi&#233;. Pour tenter d'am&#233;liorer la pr&#233;cision sur la d&#233;termination de l'unit&#233; de masse, diff&#233;rentes exp&#233;riences ont d&#233;but&#233; afin de relier le kilogramme &#224; une constante fondamentale de la physique. L'un de ces programmes a pour nom "balance du watt"et vise &#224; &#233;tablir un lien entre des mesures m&#233;caniques et des mesures &#233;lectriques. Cette voie se pr&#233;sente &#224; l'heure actuelle comme l'exp&#233;rience la plus prometteuse. Dans le dispositif exp&#233;rimental fran&#231;ais, l'utilisation de l'alliage de Pt-Ir n'est pas envisageable comme &#233;talon de masse de r&#233;f&#233;rence.

La premi&#232;re est d&#233;crite par des oscillations de relaxation entre les modes de couplage de l'&#233;nergie capacitif (E) et inductif (H). Les mesures temporelles au cours de ces oscillations sont conformes aux r&#233;sultats publi&#233;s. L'autre instabilit&#233;, li&#233;e au transport des esp&#232;ces charg&#233;es, n'existe que lorsque le plasma peut diffuser. Des mesures spatio-temporelles montrent que les fluctuations des param&#232;tres plasma sont li&#233;es &#224; la formation et &#224; la propagation p&#233;riodique d'une double couche d'amplitude moyenne. Cette double couche est une gaine interne s&#233;parant un plasma haute densit&#233;, forte temp! &#233;rature &#233;lectroniques et sans ions n&#233;gatifs dans la source d'un plasma faible densit&#233;, faible temp&#233;rature &#233;lectronique et de forte fraction d'ions n&#233;gatifs dans la chambre de diffusion.

Ces faisceaux d'&#233;lectrons sont issus de l'interaction d'une impulsion laser ultra-intense et br&#232;ve avec un jet de gaz. Jusqu'&#224; r&#233;cemment, les faisceaux d'&#233;lectrons ainsi produits avaient une divergence importante et un spectre tr&#232;s large. Un tournant important de cette discipline a &#233;t&#233; franchi lorsqu'un faisceau d'&#233;lectrons faiblement divergent (10 mrad) et, par dessus tout, dont le spectre est piqu&#233; &#224; haute &#233;nergie (170 MeV) a &#233;t&#233; observ&#233; en utilisant un nouveau spectrom&#232;tre monotir &#224; &#233;lectrons.

Nous &#233;valuons l'opportunit&#233; de substituer une telle planification &#224; celle traditionnellement utilis&#233;e pour les satellites g&#233;ostationnaires &#233;quip&#233;s de tuy&#232;res chimiques (&#224; pouss&#233;e forte). D&#232;s son apparition, la technologie des syst&#232;mes de propulsion &#224; pouss&#233;e faible a rencontr&#233; un vif int&#233;r&#234;t aupr&#232;s des agences et des soci&#233;t&#233;s spatiales. Gr&#226;ce &#224; sa haute impulsion sp&#233;cifique (qui implique une basse consommation de carburant), cette technologie est devenue tr&#232;s comp&#233;titive par rapport &#224; la technologie traditionnelle des propulseurs chimiques &#224; pouss&#233;e forte, surtout dans les phases de transfert et rendez-vous des missions spatiales. Pendant la d&#233;finition des missions &#224; pouss&#233;e faible, les analyses de faisabilit&#233; des phases de transfert et rendez-vous (via la solution de probl&#232;mes d'optimisation de trajectoire) ont &#233;t&#233; r&#233;alis&#233;es avec des solutions d'optimisation alternatives. En effet, pendant ces phases, il est n&#233;cessaire d'activer les syst&#232;mes de propulsion &#224; faible pouss&#233;e sur des longues portions du temps de transfert. Par cons&#233;quent, les probl&#232;mes d'optimisation de trajectoire &#224; pouss&#233;e forte (typiquement formul&#233;s en temps discret) ont &#233;t&#233; remplac&#233;s par des probl&#232;mes d'optimisation de trajectoire &#224; pouss&#233;e faible formul&#233;s en temps continu et r&#233;solus par des techniques de contr&#244;le en temps continu. Le premier objectif de cette th&#232;se est de comprendre quel est l'impact de la technologie &#224; faible pouss&#233;e lors de l'analyse de faisabilit&#233; de la phase de maintien &#224; poste de satellites g&#233;ostationnaires. Nous &#233;tudions en particulier l'impact de l'utilisation des syst&#232;mes de propulsion &#224; faible pouss&#233;e sur la planification de manoeuvres et sur la boucle enti&#232;re de maintien &#224; poste g&#233;ostationnaire. L'&#233;tude consiste &#224; d&#233;duire si la planification de manoeuvres &#224; pouss&#233;e faible est comp&#233;titive au regard des strat&#233;gies classiques de planification couramment employ&#233;es pour des manoeuvres &#224; pouss&#233;e forte. G&#233;n&#233;ralement, les strat&#233;gies classiques &#224; long terme pour le maintien &#224; poste sont d&#233;duites de mod&#232;les de propagation d'orbite simplifi&#233;s (en fonctions des param&#232;tres orbitaux moyenn&#233;s) par la conjonction des trois facteurs suivants : la forte pouss&#233;e des propulseurs, la dimension de la fen&#234;tre de maintien &#224; poste pas tr&#232;s contraignante ainsi que la possibilit&#233; d'ex&#233;cuter des manoeuvres &#224; basse fr&#233;quence. Dans le cadre de cette th&#232;se, compte tenu du faible niveau des pouss&#233;es et des contraintes strictes en position (fen&#234;tres de maintien &#224; poste petites), nous consid&#233;rons comme plus appropri&#233;s l'hypoth&#232;se d'une plus haute fr&#233;quence de manoeuvres et l'utilisation d'un mod&#232;le de propagation d'orbite en fonction de param&#232;tres osculateurs. Pour la planification de manoeuvres, nous proposons une solution par approche directe : le probl&#232;me de maintien &#224; poste en tant que probl&#232;me de contr&#244;le optimal est discr&#233;tis&#233; et traduit en un probl&#232;me d'optimisation param&#233;trique. Deux techniques diff&#233;rentes d'optimisation sont propos&#233;es : l'optimisation sous contraintes &#224; horizon fixe et celle &#224; horizon glissant. Cette deuxi&#232;me technique est appliqu&#233;e aux &#233;quations lin&#233;aris&#233;es du mouvement pr&#233;alablement transform&#233;es via un changement de variable &#224; la Lyapunov sur l'&#233;tat des d&#233;viations des param&#232;tres &#233;quinoxiaux osculateurs. Cette transformation de Lyapunov d&#233;finit des nouveaux param&#232;tres orbitaux. Elle rend le processus de planification plus compr&#233;hensible du point de vue du contr&#244;le et plus facile &#224; impl&#233;menter d'un point de vue num&#233;rique, gr&#226;ce aux concepts de platitude et inclusion diff&#233;rentielles. Les r&#233;sultats de la planification de manoeuvres &#224; pouss&#233;e faible sont obtenus dans un premier temps en fonction des changements de vitesse, dans un deuxi&#232;me temps en fonction des forces engendr&#233;es par les tuy&#232;res des syst&#232;mes de propulsion classiques. Le but est de d&#233;terminer la solution la plus efficace en conditions nominales et en cas de panne d'un des propulseurs.

Le but est alors de se rapprocher des conditions du noyau terrestre, constitu&#233; d'une graine solide entour&#233;e de fer liquide. La compr&#233;hension des ph&#233;nom&#232;nes d&#233;crivant la thermodynamique du noyau et le processus de geodynamo requiert la connaissance du lieu de la courbe de fusion du fer &#224; l'interface solide-liquide du noyau &#224; 3,3 Mbar. Plusieurs exp&#233;riences ont &#233;t&#233; men&#233;es dans ce but. Dans un premier temps, une mesure absolue de l'Hugoniot du fer a ete e&#64256;ectu&#233;e.

In recent years, the development of vascular diseases has been associated with the formation of disturbed patterns of wall shear stresses (WSS) and gradients of wall shear stresses (GWSS). They have been shown to affect the wall structural integrity, primarily via the changes induced on the morphology and functions of the endothelial cells (EC) and circulating blood cells. Particle Image Velocimetry measurements of the pulsatile blood flow have been performed in aneurysm models, while changing systematically their geometric parameters. The parametric study shows that the flow separates from the wall even at early stages of the disease (dilatation &#8804; 50%). A large vortex ring forms in symmetric aneurysms, followed by internal shear layers. Two regions with distinct patterns of WSS have been identified: a region of flow detachment, with low oscillatory WSS, and a downstream region of flow reattachment, where large negative WSS and sustained GWSS are produced as a result of the impact of the vortex ring. The loss of symmetry in the models engenders a helical flow pattern due to the non- symmetric vortex shedding. The dominant vortex, whose strength increases with the asymmetry parameter, is shed from the most bulged wall (anterior). It results in the formation of a large recirculating region, where ECs are subjected to quasi-steady reversed WSS of low magnitude, while the posterior wall is exposed to quasi-healthy WSS. GWSS are generated at the necks and around the point of impact of the vortex. Lagrangian tracking of blood cells inside the different models of aneurysms shows a dramatic increase in the cell residence time as the aneurysm grows. While recirculating, cells experience high shear stresses close to the walls and inside the shear layers, which may lead to cell activation. The vortical structure of the flow also convects the cells towards the wall, increasing the probability for cell deposition and ipso facto for the formation of an intraluminal thrombus.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[SPI] Engineering Sciences</field><field name="subject">An&#233;vrisme aortique abdominal</field><field name="subject">Topologie de l'&#233;coulement</field><field name="subject">Contrainte pari&#233;tale</field><field name="subject">Activation cellulaire</field><field name="subject">&#233;coulement sanguin puls&#233;</field><field name="subject">Particle Image Velocimetry</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00002309/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/50/35/98/PDF/Salsac.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comportement m&#233;canique d'un milieu granulaire inject&#233; oar un coulis de ciment: Etude exp&#233;rimentale et mod&#233;lisatino micro-m&#233;canique</field><field name="creator">Maalej, Yamen</field><field name="description">L'injection est un proc&#233;d&#233; largement utilis&#233; et relativement ancien de renforcement des sols.

L'effet escompt&#233; de la prise du ciment faisant corps avec la structure granulaire est une augmentation de raideur et un gain de coh&#233;sion. On pr&#233;sente une &#233;tude exp&#233;rimentale destin&#233;e &#224; la caract&#233;risation du comportement m&#233;canique des milieux granulaires vierges et inject&#233;s.

Elle s'int&#233;resse plus particuli&#232;rement &#224; la quantification par traitement d'images de la granulom&#233;trie des roches fragment&#233;es. Globalement, les d&#233;veloppements men&#233;s portent sur l'am&#233;lioration des deux &#233;tapes les plus d&#233;terminantes de la mesure : l'extraction des contours des fragments de roches dans l'image (2D) et la reconstruction de la courbe granulom&#233;trique en volume (&#233;tape de st&#233;r&#233;ologie, 3D). Actuellement, le tamisage (ou plus g&#233;n&#233;ralement le criblage) est le moyen le plus utilis&#233; pour la mesure de la granulom&#233;trie des roches fragment&#233;es. Il constitue la r&#233;f&#233;rence actuelle de la mesure. En cons&#233;quence, toute mesure &#233;tablie par traitement d'images sera valid&#233;e sur la base des r&#233;sultats du tamisage. En ce qui concerne l'&#233;tape d'extraction des contours des fragments, le probl&#232;me majeur qui se pose est celui du filtrage correct du bruit pr&#233;sent dans l'image. Dans un premier temps, de nouveaux outils de filtrage, bas&#233;s sur les transformations morphologiques r&#233;siduelles, assez puissants et adapt&#233;s au cas des images de fragments de roches sont introduits et &#233;valu&#233;s. Dans un second temps, les surfaces des fragments sont extraites gr&#226;ce une segmentation de l'image, bas&#233;e sur une ligne de partage des eaux contr&#244;l&#233;e par les marqueurs extraits des filtrages. La robustesse et l'automatisation de la d&#233;marche sont valid&#233;es sur plusieurs cas d'images de fragments de roches. Le second probl&#232;me abord&#233; dans cette recherche est celui de la reconstruction de la courbe granulom&#233;trique en volume &#224; partir des surfaces extraites par traitement d'images. Afin d'&#233;viter l'occurrence de nombreux biais li&#233;s &#224; cette &#233;tape, nous proposons un d&#233;coupage en deux sous-probl&#232;mes, et ce, en fonction de la disposition des mat&#233;riaux analys&#233;s (tas abattu, camion, convoyeur &#224; bande) : - dans le cas de faible recouvrement et chevauchement : un mod&#232;le exp&#233;rimental de reconstruction volumique mettant en jeu les donn&#233;es des refus mat&#233;riels (surface et volumes), et bas&#233; d'embl&#233;e sur les r&#233;sultats de r&#233;f&#233;rence est d&#233;velopp&#233;. Les deux lois des tailles et des &#233;paisseurs (lois de reconstruction) permettant d'attribuer une taille et un volume aux surfaces sont valid&#233;es exp&#233;rimentalement. - dans le cas complexe de pr&#233;sence de masquage entre fragments : nous commen&#231;ons par &#233;mettre des hypoth&#232;ses essentielles &#224; l'adaptation de la th&#233;orie des mod&#232;les de structures al&#233;atoires &#224; notre cas de fragments de roches. L'analyse des limites d'une application directe du mod&#232;le al&#233;atoire de feuilles mortes (hypoth&#232;se du sch&#233;ma bool&#233;en) nous a amen&#233; &#224; &#233;laborer une nouvelle m&#233;thode d'acquisition bas&#233;e sur une incidence &#224; &#233;clairement variable. S'inspirant de la technique du &#171;shape-from-shading&#187;, elle permet d'obtenir une information suppl&#233;mentaire sur le recouvrement (ombre port&#233;e entre fragments) pour l'application de la statistique des grains intacts. Enfin, les r&#233;sultats obtenus dans cette recherche pour les fragments en vrac mais aussi pour d'autres types d'images d'&#233;l&#233;ments granulaires, nous ont permis d'envisager d'ores et d&#233;j&#224; une valorisation aussi bien aupr&#232;s de l'industrie min&#233;rale et aussi dans d'autres domaines tels que l'agroalimentaire, pharmaceutique, cimenteries,...</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language" /><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[SDU] Sciences of the Universe</field><field name="subject">Mesure granulom&#233;trique</field><field name="subject">Analyse d'images</field><field name="subject">Morphologie math&#233;matique</field><field name="subject">Sur-segmentation</field><field name="subject">Fusion</field><field name="subject">Particules fines</field><field name="subject">Filtrage</field><field name="subject">Op&#233;rateur r&#233;siduel num&#233;rique</field><field name="subject">Marquage</field><field name="subject">Boule maximale inscrite</field><field name="subject">Reconstruction volumique</field><field name="subject">Passant cumul&#233;</field><field name="subject">Histogramme</field><field name="subject">S&#233;gr&#233;gation</field><field name="subject">Recouvrement et chevauchement</field><field name="subject">Mod&#232;le de feuilles mortes</field><field name="subject">Statistique des grains intacts</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00002394/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/50/04/80/PDF/These-OUTAL-010606.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Commande r&#233;f&#233;renc&#233;e capteur des robots non holonomes</field><field name="creator">Maya Mendez, Mauro Eduardo</field><field name="description">Ce travail de th&#232;se concerne la synth&#232;se de commandes r&#233;f&#233;renc&#233;es capteur pour les robots non holonomes, dans le cadre de l'approche par fonctions transverses, ainsi que l'&#233;tude de la robustesse de ces lois de commande.

En revanche, il sera n&#233;cessaire d'e&#64256;ectuer les m&#234;mes mesures sur le compos&#233;e optimalement dope a&#64257;n de voir si les d&#233;fauts d'irradiation permettent de passer de la limite d'un couplage coh&#233;rent a celui d'un couplage incoh&#233;rent. Concernant les propri&#233;t&#233;s de l'&#233;tat mixte, la r&#233;sonance plasma a pu montrer que le rajout d'une composante parall&#232;le aux plans CuO2 du champ magn&#233;tique ` a un liquide de pancakes, permet d'induire des corr&#233;lations spatiales. Cet e&#64256;et est du a la r&#233;organisation des courants supraconducteurs. L&#224; encore, seule la r&#233;sonance plasma Josephson permet de sonder l'&#233;tat liquide des vortex en raison de sa grande fr&#233;quence par rapport aux mouvements de vortex. En conclusion, cette th&#232;se a d&#233;montre l'importance de la technique de la r&#233;sonance plasma Josephson pour l'&#233;tude des propri&#233;t&#233;s supraconductrices dans les mat&#233;riaux lamellaires. Elle appelle a la mise au point de techniques exp&#233;rimentales de d&#233;tection r&#233;solue en fr&#233;quence qui permettront d'explorer de fa&#231;on continue le diagramme de phase en champ et en temp&#233;rature.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[PHYS] Physics</field><field name="subject">Couplage Josephson</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00002925/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/50/36/36/PDF/Spathis.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vers une ing&#233;nierie de bandes des cellules photovolta&#239;ques &#224; h&#233;t&#233;rojonctions a-Si:H/c-Si.</field><field name="creator">Damon-Lacoste, J&#233;r&#244;me</field><field name="description">Cette th&#232;se a initi&#233; en France la th&#233;matique des cellules solaires &#224; h&#233;t&#233;rojonctions a-Si:H/c-Si. Cette technologie consiste &#224; d&#233;poser des couches de silicium amorphe sur des substrats de silicium cristallin ce qui pr&#233;sente l'avantage (par rapport aux homojonctions) de fabriquer des cellules solaires &#224; haut rendement enti&#232;rement &#224; basse temp&#233;rature (&lt; 200 &#176;C). Elle permet aussi de r&#233;aliser plus ais&#233;ment des cellules sur substrats c-Si tr&#232;s minces (&lt; 150 &#181;m). Les sub-strats utilis&#233;s sont ici essentiellement des c-Si de type p. Les couches a-Si:H, pm-Si:H ou &#181;c-Si sont d&#233;pos&#233;es par RF-PECVD. Une attention particuli&#232;re est port&#233;e au d&#233;p&#244;t d'ITO, aux &#233;tapes de nettoyage et &#224; la reproductibilit&#233;. Les cellules solaires ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;velopp&#233;es dans un souci constant d'industrialisation : grande surface (25 cm2) et m&#233;tallisations bas co&#251;t s&#233;rigraphi&#233;es. Malgr&#233; cela, les rendements ont progress&#233; de 9% &#224; 17 % avec les meilleurs Vco compris entre 660 mV et 677 mV (&#224; l'&#233;poque un record). Une excellente passivation a &#233;t&#233; obtenue avec une vitesse de recombinaison de 16 cm/s moyenn&#233;e sur 25 cm2. Un travail plus th&#233;orique associant mesures ellipsom&#233;triques in situ, mesures HR-TEM et mesures de capacit&#233;, SIMS et simulations a permis d'obtenir plusieurs r&#233;sultats originaux et de montrer que la physique des cellules &#224; h&#233;t&#233;rojonctions a-Si:H/c-Si &#233;tait encore mal comprise.

Ces limitations viennent du fait que l'effet laser utilise des r&#233;sonances atomiques. L'optique non-lin&#233;aire permet de s'en affranchir c'est un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne non r&#233;sonnant, donc peu s&#233;lectif en longueur d'onde. N&#233;anmoins elle pr&#233;sente des caract&#233;ristiques particuli&#232;res : trois fr&#233;quences diff&#233;rentes mises en jeu, l'absence de stockage d'&#233;nergie, et le r&#244;le primordial de la phase relative entre les ondes. Dans ce travail nous mettons &#224; profit ces specificit&#233;s pour mettre en forme spectralement ou temporellement l'&#233;mission de lumi&#232;re dans des sources infrarouges. La premi&#232;re source r&#233;alis&#233;e est un oscillateur param&#233;trique optique (OPO) &#224; 3 &#956;m utilisa! nt deux cristaux de KTA. Ses performances sont discut&#233;es en r&#233;gime nanoseconde. Puis nous r&#233;alisons un OPO &#224; cristal de PPLN g&#233;n&#233;rant des impulsions courtes sous pompage continu par modulation active des pertes. Nous proposons ensuite d'utiliser un absorbant saturable pour verrouiller passivement les modes d'un OPO continu pr&#233;sentant un fort d&#233;saccord de vitesse de groupe entre la pompe et le signal. Enfin, nous consid&#233;rons le cas des sources int&#233;grant &#224; la fois un milieu laser et un dispositif non-lin&#233;aire. Nous pr&#233;sentons d'abord un miroir non-lin&#233;aire &#224; base de PPLN int&#233;gr&#233; dans un laser Cr:ZnSe, permettant de produire des impulsions picosecondes accordables autour de 2,5 &#956;m.

Les transgalacto-oligosaccharides (TOS), oligom&#232;res lin&#233;aires de galactose obtenus par fermentation du lactose, appartiennent &#224; la famille des OND. L'objectif de ce travail, r&#233;alis&#233; en &#233;troite collaboration avec la soci&#233;t&#233; Bl&#233;dina, &#233;tait de caract&#233;riser les effets induits par la consommation de TOS sur la fonction intestinale. Ce travail incluait une premi&#232;re partie d&#233;di&#233;e aux effets des TOS sur la muqueuse intestinale, une deuxi&#232;me partie visant &#224; &#233;tudier les cons&#233;quences de la consommation de TOS sur la composition de la flore f&#233;cale et les param&#232;tres des r&#233;ponses immunitaires inn&#233;es et adaptatives au niveau intestinal et p&#233;riph&#233;rique, et la troisi&#232;me partie a consist&#233; en une &#233;tude des effets des TOS sur les signes cliniques et biologiques d'allergie &#224; l'arachide. Nous avons &#233;tabli que la consommation de TOS induit une forte augmentation de la quantit&#233; de prot&#233;ines totales contenues dans la muqueuse intestinale. Cependant, cet effet ne semble pas d&#251; &#224; une augmentation de la production des mucines, ni &#224; un effet trophique des TOS. Par ailleurs, nous avons confirm&#233; l'effet pr&#233;biotique des TOS en montrant que le nombre de bifidobact&#233;ries &#233;tait augment&#233; apr&#232;s 4 semaines de consommation de TOS. Une analyse plus fine par DGGE nous a &#233;galement permis de montrer que la diversit&#233; de la flore lactobacille est augment&#233;e par la consommation de TOS, m&#234;me si, d'un point de vue quantitatif, les lactobacilles sont tr&#232;s peu augment&#233;s par les TOS. Certains param&#232;tres immunitaires p&#233;riph&#233;riques, et notamment la proportion de cellules CD4+ dans la rate, sont &#233;galement modifi&#233;s lorsque les animaux consomment les TOS. Nous n'avons en revanche pas constat&#233; d'effets au niveau intestinal. Enfin, lors de notre &#233;tude sur animaux sensibilis&#233;s &#224; l'arachide, nous avons &#233;tabli que la consommation de TOS permet de diminuer les immunoglobulines IgG1 sp&#233;cifiques, tout en augmentant la prolif&#233;ration des spl&#233;nocytes cultiv&#233;s en pr&#233;sence d'un mitog&#232;ne non sp&#233;cifique et leur production de cytokines. Cependant, si certains signes biologiques d'allergie sont diminu&#233;s par la consommation de TOS, les signes cliniques d'allergie &#224; l'arachide ne sont pas affect&#233;s. Nos r&#233;sultats ont donc prouv&#233; que les TOS induisent de r&#233;elles modifications de l'&#233;cosyst&#232;me intestinal, mais aussi du syst&#232;me immunitaire p&#233;riph&#233;rique.

Notre travail se divise en trois parties. La premi&#232;re analyse les mod&#232;les gouvern&#233;s par une &#233;quation diff&#233;rentielle stochastique. Apr&#232;s un court chapitre technique, un mod&#232;le innovant pour les carnets d'ordres est propos&#233;. Nous consid&#233;rons que le spread bid-ask n'est pas un d&#233;faut, mais plut&#244;t une propri&#233;t&#233; intrins&#232;que du march&#233;. L'incertitude est port&#233; par le mouvement Brownien qui conduit l'actif. Nous montrons que l'&#233;volution des spread peut &#234;tre &#233;valu&#233; gr&#226;ce &#224; des formules ferm&#233;s et nous &#233;tudions l'impact de l'incertitude du sous-jacent sur les produits d&#233;riv&#233;s. En suite, nous introduisons le mod&#232;le PBS pour le pricing des options europ&#233;ennes. L'id&#233;e novatrice est de distinguer la volatilit&#233; du march&#233; par rapport au param&#232;tre utilis&#233; par les traders pour se couvrir. Nous assumons la premi&#232;re constante, alors que le deuxi&#232;me devient une estimation subjective et erron&#233;e de la premi&#232;re. Nous prouvons que ce mod&#232;le pr&#233;voit un spread bid-ask et un smile de volatilit&#233;. Les propri&#233;t&#233;s plus int&#233;ressantes de ce mod&#232;le sont l'existence de formules ferm&#233;s pour le pricing, l'impact de la d&#233;rive du sous-jacent et une efficace strat&#233;gie de calibration. La seconde partie s'int&#233;resse aux mod&#232;les d&#233;crit par une &#233;quation aux d&#233;riv&#233;es partielles. Les cas lin&#233;aire et non-lin&#233;aire sont analys&#233;s s&#233;par&#233;ment. Dans le premier nous montrons des relations int&#233;ressantes entre la th&#233;orie des erreurs et celui des ondelettes. Dans le cas non-lin&#233;aire nous &#233;tudions la sensibilit&#233; des solutions &#224; l'aide de la th&#233;orie des erreurs. Sauf dans le cas d'une solution exacte, il y a deux approches possibles: On peut d'abord discr&#233;tiser l'EDP et &#233;tudier la sensibilit&#233; du probl&#232;me discr&#233;tis&#233;, soit d&#233;montrer que les sensibilit&#233;s th&#233;oriques v&#233;rifient des EDP. Les deux cas sont &#233;tudi&#233;s, et nous prouvons que les sharp et le biais sont solutions d'EDP lin&#233;aires d&#233;pendantes de la solution de l'EDP originaire et nous proposons des algorithmes pour &#233;valuer num&#233;riquement les sensibilit&#233;s. Enfin, la troisi&#232;me partie est d&#233;di&#233;e aux &#233;quations stochastiques aux d&#233;riv&#233;es partielles. Notre analyse se divise en deux chapitres. D'abord nous &#233;tudions la transmission de l'incertitude, pr&#233;sente dans la condition initiale, &#224; la solution de l'EDPS. En suite, nous analysons l'impact d'une perturbation dans les termes fonctionnelles de l'EDPS et dans le coefficient de la fonction de Green associ&#233;e.

N&#233;anmoins, les m&#233;canismes &#224; l'origine de cette fissuration sont encore mal compris. Un certain nombre de mod&#232;les ont &#233;t&#233; d&#233;velopp&#233;s et propos&#233;s, cependant peu d'entre eux arrivent &#224; int&#233;grer l'influence de tous les param&#232;tres. Le m&#233;canisme d'oxydation interne et la famille de mod&#232;les bas&#233;s sur l'action de l'hydrog&#232;ne ont paru les plus prometteurs.

Les caract&#233;risations des fissures et des p&#233;n&#233;trations d'oxyde intergranulaire par MEB, MET, SIMS, Nano-SIMS et des dosages d'hydrog&#232;ne, ont permis une nouvelle analyse de la CSC de l'Alliage 600 en milieu REP, concernant plus particuli&#232;rement les points suivants : la stabilit&#233; thermodynamique des phases, la r&#233;partition et la morphologie des oxydes observ&#233;s dans les fissures, le r&#244;le de l'hydrog&#232;ne, la nature des carbures de chrome et le caract&#232;re continu/discontinu du m&#233;canisme de fissuration.

M&#234;me si les puissances mises en jeu &#224; cette &#233;poque &#233;taient tr&#232;s faibles, la brillance de cette source rivalisait d&#233;j&#224; avec un million de soleils. De ce fait, il &#233;tait facile de voir l'int&#233;r&#234;t de pouvoir placer une fraction d'&#233;nergie lumineuse dans des impulsions de dur&#233;e les plus courtes possibles. Avec la technique d'amplification &#224; d&#233;rive de fr&#233;quence, l'exploration des syst&#232;me d'&#233;tirement et de compression commence. Malgr&#233; une diversit&#233; de solutions pour les &#233;tireurs et les compresseurs, le syst&#232;me de Treacy va dominer compl&#232;tement les architectures lasers en raison de son tr&#232;s haut niveau de dommage essentiel pour les applications de tr&#232;s haute &#233;nergie. Pourtant, cette solution est loin d'&#234;tre facile &#224; mettre en oeuvre et le syst&#232;me est associ&#233; &#224; de nombreux d&#233;fauts. Le co&#251;t des optiques (r&#233;seaux de diffraction et optiques r&#233;flectrices du triplet de &#214;ffner) est tr&#232;s &#233;lev&#233; en raison des tr&#232;s grandes dimensions et des qualit&#233;s de surface n&#233;cessaires pour l'obtention d'impulsion de 20-fs.

Dans ces applications, on rencontre souvent ces milieux pr&#233;sentant des d&#233;fauts localis&#233;s, c'est-&#224;-dire des milieux qui diff&#232;rent de milieux p&#233;riodiques dans des r&#233;gions born&#233;es.

Nous avons donc approfondi la question de trouver des conditions aux bords parfaitement transparentes. C'est pourquoi nous avons cherch&#233; &#224; g&#233;n&#233;raliser les techniques de conditions transparentes non locales, de type Neumann-to-Dirichlet, bien &#233;tablies pour les milieux homog&#232;nes &#224; l'ext&#233;rieur de la perturbation. La difficult&#233; est que lorsque le milieu ext&#233;rieur est homog&#232;ne, on ne dispose plus d'une repr&#233;sentation explicite de la solution. Nous traitons successivement trois situations de difficult&#233; croissante : le cas monodimensionnel qui est un cas classique mais dont l'&#233;tude a des vertus p&#233;dagogiques, le probl&#232;me du guide p&#233;riodique localement perturb&#233; et le probl&#232;me plus complexe du milieu p&#233;riodique dans les deux dimensions.

Cette architecture, consistant en un injecteur (une source d'harmoniques d'ordre &#233;lev&#233;) coupl&#233; &#224; un amplificateur (plasma cr&#233;&#233; par laser), correspond &#224; celle d'une cha&#238;ne laser de puissance dans la gamme spectrale de l'XUV. Le laser &#224; 32,8 nm &#233;tudi&#233; ici, est produit par l'injection d'harmonique d'ordre &#233;lev&#233; dans un plasma de krypton cr&#233;&#233; par Optical Field Ionisation (OFI).

Cette th&#232;se s'inscrit dans la continuit&#233; de ce dernier travail en tentant d'aborder diff&#233;rents aspects li&#233;s, non seulement &#224; une meilleure compr&#233;hension des processus physiques impliqu&#233;s, mais aussi &#224; la caract&#233;risation spatio-temporelle de ce type de source.Nous avons d&#233;montr&#233; exp&#233;rimentalement et pour la premi&#232;re fois qu'une source dans le domaine de l'XUV peut &#234;tre &#224; la fois tr&#232;s compacte, &#233;nerg&#233;tique (1 &#181;J par impulsion), proche de la limite de diffraction et de celle de Fourier. En effet, gr&#226;ce au filtrage spatial des harmoniques par le milieu amplificateur, le laser XUV inject&#233; &#224; 32,8 nm montre un profil spatial gaussien avec une divergence de 0,7 mrad (&#224; 1/e2).

Dans nos conditions de d&#233;p&#244;t, en changeant le temps de croissance entre 100 msec et 1 seconde, nous avons pu contr&#244;ler la taille des nanocristaux (de 4 nm &#224; 12 nm). A partir de la mesure de la taille des nanocristaux sur les images MET, nous avons pu calculer la vitesse de croissance radiale. Cette vitesse est proportionnelle &#224; la pression partielle de silane dans le m&#233;lange gazeux. Nous avons &#233;galement montr&#233; le r&#244;le important de l'hydrog&#232;ne atomique pour le processus de cristallisation des nanoparticules dans le plasma. La ma&#238;trise de la synth&#232;se des nanocristaux de silicium ouvre la voie &#224; deux champs d'applications : (i) la fabrication de diodes &#233;lectroluminescences et (ii) la r&#233;alisation de transistors &#224; un &#233;lectron. Pour la premi&#232;re application, une &#233;tude pr&#233;alable de photoluminescence a montr&#233; un d&#233;placement vers le bleu du pic de photoluminescence lorsque la taille des nanocristaux diminue. Cela est interpr&#233;t&#233; &#224; la fois comme un effet de confinement quantique et de passivation de la surface des nanocristaux par une coquille de SiOx. Nous avons &#233;galement &#233;labor&#233; des diodes &#233;lectroluminescence PIN bas&#233;es sur les nanocristaux de silicium. Apr&#232;s une optimisation de la structure PIN et des conditions de d&#233;p&#244;t de la couche intrins&#232;que, nous avons obtenu une &#233;lectroluminescence dans la gamme infrarouge-visible &#224; temp&#233;rature ambiante. En vue de l'application aux transistors, nous avons fait des exp&#233;riences pr&#233;alables d'injection de charge dans les nanocristaux par AFM/KFM.

Dans le cas des rhabdovirus, une famille o&#249; l'on retrouve notamment le virus de la rage (RV) et le virus de la stomatite v&#233;siculaire (VSV),cette fonction est assur&#233;e &#224; pH l&#233;g&#232;rement acide par la glycoprot&#233;ine G. Cette prot&#233;ine existe sous au moins trois conformations distinctes : &#224; pH neutre, elle est pr&#233;sente sous une conformation native (N). Apr&#232;s une br&#232;ve incubation &#224; pH acide, elle est pr&#233;sente sous une conformation activ&#233;e (A), sous laquelle elle est capable d'interagir avec une membrane cible par l'interm&#233;diaire d'un peptide hydrophobe. Enfin, apr&#232;s une incubation prolong&#233;e &#224; pH acide, elle appara&#238;t sous une conformation inactiv&#233;e (I) et est alors incapable d'induire la fusion membranaire. Contrairement &#224; toutes les autres familles virales &#233;tudi&#233;es &#224; ce jour, il existe un &#233;quilibre d&#233;pendant du pH entre ces conformations. De nombreuses donn&#233;es dans divers syst&#232;mes sugg&#232;rent qu'une prot&#233;ine unique ne serait pas suffisante pour catalyser les processus de fusion membranaire, mais qu'au contraire une machinerie constitu&#233;e d'un nombre plus ou moins important de prot&#233;ines fusog&#232;nes serait n&#233;cessaire. Au cours de ce travail, nous avons &#233;tudi&#233; certaines propri&#233;t&#233;s du complexe de fusion des rhabdovirus. Nous avons ainsi montr&#233; qu'il &#233;tait de grande taille et qu il &#233;tait probablement plus grand que ce qui avait &#233;t&#233; propos&#233; pour d autres familles virales. De plus, il est apparu que le complexe de fusion du virus rabique n avait pas une unique architecture possible, mais qu il existait au contraire divers types de complexe. Ensuite, l'observation par microscopie &#233;lectronique de particules virales en train de fusionner avec des liposomes nous a montr&#233; que le processus de fusion induit par VSV se produisait toujours par la base et qu il s accompagnait d une redisposition compl&#232;te des glycoprot&#233;ines &#224; la surface du virus suivant un r&#233;seau h&#233;lico&#239;dal. Enfin, nous sommes parvenu &#224; isoler l ectodomaine de G et &#224; en obtenir des cristaux diffractant &#224; 3,5 &#197;, ce qui permet d envisager &#224; terme une r&#233;solution de la structure de G. L &#233;tude de l interaction entre l ectodomaine de G et des liposomes nous a permis de reproduire les r&#233;seaux h&#233;lico&#239;daux observ&#233;s &#224; la surface du virus et d &#233;tudier leurs propri&#233;t&#233;s. L ensemble de ces donn&#233;es nous a permis de proposer un nouveau mod&#232;le pour le processus de fusion chez les rhabdovirus, mais il pourrait &#233;galement &#234;tre pertinent pour d autres familles virales.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[SDV:BBM:BS] Life Sciences/Biochemistry, Molecular Biology/Biomolecules</field><field name="subject">[SDV:BBM:MN] Life Sciences/Biochemistry, Molecular Biology/Molecular Networks</field><field name="subject">Rhabdovirus</field><field name="subject">Fusion membranaire</field><field name="subject">Glycoprot&#233;ine G</field><field name="subject">Ectodomaine</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/pastel-00504172/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://pastel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/50/41/72/PDF/Roche.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contr&#244;le et mise en forme des fronts de phase et d'&#233;nergie</field><field name="creator">Chanteloup, Jean-Christophe</field><field name="description">Ce m&#233;moire de th&#232;se traite du contr&#244;le et de la mise en forme des fronts de phase et d'&#233;nergie d'impulsions lasers br&#232;ves ultra-intenses.&lt;br /&gt;La premi&#232;re partie est consacr&#233;e &#224; la conception et la r&#233;alisation d'une boucle d'optique adaptative pour la correction des distorsions de surface d'onde sur la cha&#238;ne laser de puissance 100 T&#233;rawatts du Laboratoire pour l'Utilisation des Lasers Intenses.

Des associations d'organismes, d&#233;finies &#224; l'aide d'analyses multivari&#233;es (analyses en composantes principales, classification hi&#233;rarchique), se r&#233;partissent de fa&#231;on r&#233;currente et en accord avec les faci&#232;s s&#233;dimentaires, caract&#233;risant ainsi des milieux de d&#233;p&#244;t diff&#233;rents. 16 associations sont ainsi d&#233;finies: l'association &#224; 'Longvillia', 'Nicolella', 'Paucicrura' et 'Ib&#233;romena' de l'Ordovicien sup&#233;rieur de Sardaigne; l'association &#224; 'Adolfia', 'Stenorhynchia', 'Chon&#233;tides', 'Crino&#239;des-Brachiopodes', 'Crino&#239;des-Ostracodes', 'Ostracodes', 'Ostracodes-Tentaculitides', 'Bryozoaires' et 'Dacryoconarides' du D&#233;vonien inf&#233;rieur du Massif armoricain; l'association &#224; 'Rhynchonellides', 'Spirif&#233;rides' et 'T&#233;tracoralliaires-Crino&#239;des-Dacryoconarides' du D&#233;vonien inf&#233;rieur ib&#233;rique. Une grande partie des archives pal&#233;ontologiques est conserv&#233;e au sein de concentrations coquilli&#232;res d'&#233;paisseur variable. L'&#233;tude des concentrations coquilli&#232;res, en consid&#233;rant les diff&#233;rents crit&#232;res taphonomiques et leur r&#233;partition au sein des s&#233;quences g&#233;n&#233;tiques, a permis la distinction de 2 types de concentration et l'&#233;laboration d'un mod&#232;le expliquant leur mise en place. La formation des concentrations coquilli&#232;res est li&#233;e &#224; la dynamique des temp&#234;tes (facteurs autocycliques) et aux variations du niveau marin (facteurs allocycliques). Les concentrations fines de temp&#234;tes (type A) se forment pr&#233;f&#233;rentiellement lors des phases de chute du niveau marin &#224; tr&#232;s haute fr&#233;quence, tandis que les concentrations composites de temp&#234;tes (type B) s'individualisent lors des p&#233;riodes d'&#233;l&#233;vation du niveau de la mer &#224; tr&#232;s haute fr&#233;quence. Ces p&#233;riodes se caract&#233;risent par des apports s&#233;dimentaires faibles: il s'agit d'intervalles de stabilit&#233; &#224; l'interface eau-s&#233;diment, favorisant la r&#233;troaction taphonomique ou encore l'activit&#233; des organismes perforants (bio&#233;rosion). Les accumulations coquilli&#232;res qui en r&#233;sultent sont des niveaux condens&#233;s, caract&#233;ris&#233;es par l'amalgame de nombreuses g&#233;n&#233;rations d'organismes. La compl&#233;mentarit&#233; des approches s&#233;quentielles et pal&#233;ontologiques se r&#233;v&#232;le fructueuse dans la compr&#233;hension de la dynamique des associations: le r&#233;sultat des analyses multivari&#233;es des niveaux &#224; partir de leur contenu faunique est en accord avec les regroupements &#233;tablis par la stratigraphie s&#233;quentielle. Les associations refl&#232;tent clairement les fluctuations du niveau marin. Lors des variations progressives et mod&#233;r&#233;es du niveau marin, les remplacements d'associations se caract&#233;risent par une r&#233;organisation de la composition taxonomique, de la diversit&#233; et des r&#233;seaux trophiques (remplacements d'associations par r&#233;organisation). Lors de variations rapides et importantes du niveau marin, les remplacements d'association se d&#233;finissent par des renouvellements dans la structure &#233;cologique (remplacements d'associations par renouvellement). Des changements pal&#233;o&#233;cologiques sont ainsi d&#233;finis en relation avec les variations eustatiques.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[SDU:EASC:GEOL:SEDI] Sciences of the Universe/Earth Sciences/Geology/Sedimentology</field><field name="subject">[SDU:EASC:GEOL:STRA] Sciences of the Universe/Earth Sciences/Geology/Stratigraphy</field><field name="subject">remplacements d'associations</field><field name="subject">variations eustatiques</field><field name="subject">concentrations coquilli&#232;res</field><field name="subject">brachiopodes</field><field name="subject">Pal&#233;ozo&#239;que</field><field name="subject">domaine Ib&#233;ro-armoricain</field><field name="subject">Sardaigne</field><field name="identifier">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00007779/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/74/68/PDF/tel-00007779.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#233;thodologie d'&#233;criture de compilateurs - une exp&#233;rience du langage ALGOL 68</field><field name="creator">Simonet, Michel</field><field name="description">.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[INFO:SESC] Computer Science/Software Engineering and Symbolic Computing</field><field name="subject">Algol 68</field><field name="subject">langage</field><field name="subject">programmation</field><field name="subject">compilation</field><field name="subject">compilateur</field><field name="subject">compilateurs</field><field name="subject">&#233;criture</field><field name="subject">ALGOL</field><field name="subject">ALGOL68</field><field name="subject">ALGOL 68</field><field name="subject">noyau</field><field name="subject">traduction</field><field name="subject">langage algorithmique</field><field name="subject">ALGOL X</field><field name="subject">calculateur</field><field name="subject">ALGOL 68-R</field><field name="identifier">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00010531/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/85/98/PDF/tel-00010531.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">M&#233;thodologie d'&#233;criture de compilateurs - une exp&#233;rience du langage ALGOL 68</field><field name="creator">Voiron, Jacques</field><field name="description">.</field><field name="date">1976</field><field name="language">French</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">[INFO:SESC] Computer Science/Software Engineering and Symbolic Computing</field><field name="subject">Algol 68</field><field name="subject">langage</field><field name="subject">programmation</field><field name="subject">compilation</field><field name="subject">compilateur</field><field name="subject">compilateurs</field><field name="subject">&#233;criture</field><field name="subject">ALGOL</field><field name="subject">ALGOL68</field><field name="subject">ALGOL 68</field><field name="subject">noyau</field><field name="subject">traduction</field><field name="subject">langage algorithmique</field><field name="subject">ALGOL X</field><field name="subject">calculateur</field><field name="subject">ALGOL 68-R</field><field name="identifier">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00010532/en/</field><field name="identifier">http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/85/99/PDF/tel-00010532.pdf</field></doc><doc><field name="title">R&#233;duction de variance et discr&#233;tisation d'&#233;quations diff&#233;rentielles stochastiques. &lt;br /&gt;Th&#233;or&#232;mes limites presque s&#251;re pour les martingales quasi-continues &#224; gauche.</field><field name="creator">Kebaier, Ahmed</field><field name="description">Cette Th&#232;se est compos&#233;e de deux parties portant respectivement sur la discr&#233;tisation des &#233;quations diff&#233;rentielles stochastiques et sur le th&#233;or&#232;me de la limite centrale presque s&#251;re pour les martingales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;La premi&#232;re Partie est compos&#233;e de trois chapitres: Le premier chapitre introduit le cadre de l'&#233;tude et pr&#233;sente les r&#233;sultats obtenus.

Elle aborde cette question en s'int&#233;ressant aux conditions d'&#233;laboration et de partage des repr&#233;sentations dans les situations d'action collective. Le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne du quiproquo, &#233;tonnement peu &#233;tudi&#233; dans la litt&#233;rature, sert ici de mod&#232;le arch&#233;typal dans la mesure o&#249; les repr&#233;sentations des acteurs (savoirs, conversations, informations..) les conduisent &#224; une mise en danger collective alors que tout leur semble &#234;tre conforme aux r&#232;gles en place et aux observations qu'ils peuvent faire. Ce mod&#232;le s'est av&#233;r&#233; d'une grande pertinence &#224; la fois pour relire des cas c&#233;l&#232;bres de la litt&#233;rature (Weick sur Tenerife) et pour analyser des accidents r&#233;cents (l'effondrement du tunnel du nouveau m&#233;tro en plein Paris). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A partir de ce mod&#232;le initial, la th&#232;se pr&#233;sente une nouvelle approche contingente de la gestion des risques en analysant diff&#233;rents r&#233;gimes de repr&#233;sentation du danger et de conception des r&#232;gles de gestion associ&#233;es. Cette analyse aboutit &#224; mettre en &#233;vidence des formes d'organisations nouvelles notamment celles qu'adoptent des firmes produisant des logiciels antivirus ou celles des organisations humanitaires en cas de catastrophe naturelle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle permet donc de construire un tableau raisonn&#233; des strat&#233;gies possibles allant des strat&#233;gies traditionnelles bas&#233;es sur la multiplication des r&#232;gles (Syst&#232;me International d'Evaluation de la S&#233;curit&#233; (SIES) &#233;tudi&#233;e chez ATOFINA) o&#249; l'on pense pouvoir r&#233;duire les risques de quiproquo au minimum, aux strat&#233;gies les plus r&#233;centes qui se pr&#233;parent activement &#224; l'&#233;volution rapide et &#224; l'ind&#233;termination de la nature des dangers.

Il appara&#238;t cependant clairement aujourd'hui qu'il sera difficile de d&#233;passer significativement ce niveau de performance avec un dispositif de ce type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L'utilisation d'une transition optique, toutes choses &#233;tant &#233;gales par ailleurs, ouvre la perspective d'une am&#233;lioration de 4 ou 5 ordres de grandeur de la stabilit&#233; et de l'incertitude relative sur la plupart des effets syst&#233;matiques.
