<add><doc><field name="title">Social justice after Kant: Between constructivism and deconstruction (Rawls, Habermas, Levinas, Derrida)</field><field name="creator">Bankovsky, Miriam Ann, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relation between two contrasting approaches to justice: the constructive and reconstructive projects of Rawls and Habermas on the one hand, and the deconstructive projects of Levinas and Derrida on the other. First, I identify the central difference between the two projects, reconstructing each account of justice as it develops in relation to Kant??s practical philosophy. I then argue that the two projects are complementary.               [New Paragraph]               Whilst Rawls and Habermas emphasise the possibility of objectively realising Kant??s idea of an impartial standpoint among autonomous persons, Levinas and Derrida defend the impossibility of determining the content of justice. Rawls and Habermas subscribe to the ??art of the possible??, rendering Kant??s impartial standpoint by means of the ??original position?? (Rawls) or the ??procedures of discourse ethics?? (Habermas). By contrast, Levinas argues for justice??s failure, discovering, in Kant??s moral law, a principle of responsibility for the particular other which conflicts with impartiality. Distinguishing himself from both the reconstructive tradition and Levinas, Derrida affirms, in part through his readings of Kant, the ??undecidability?? of the critical function of justice. Committed to the possibility of justice, Derrida also acknowledges its impossibility: no local determination can reconcile responsibility before the other with impartiality among all.               [New Paragraph]               Having identified the central difference between the two traditions, I then defend their complementarity. ??Reasonable faith?? in the possibility of justice must be supplemented by the acknowledgment of its impossibility. Conversely, attesting to justice??s failure is unsatisfactory without commitment to the possibility of constructing just social forms. Distancing myself from the liberal critique whereby deconstruction withdraws from the political (Fraser, McCarthy, Benhabib, Gutmann), I instead add my voice to a dissenting group (Young, Cornell, Mouffe, Honig, Honneth, Patton, Thomassen) which affirms that deconstruction can productively engage with the constructive tradition. Deconstruction is at home in Rawls?? view that ??the ideal of a just constitution is always something to be worked toward??.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Derrida</field><field name="subject">Rawls</field><field name="subject">Habermas</field><field name="subject">Levinas</field><field name="subject">Kant</field><field name="subject">Justice</field><field name="subject">Liberalism</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="subject">Moral philosophy</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Politics</field><field name="subject">Political philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">URANIUM (VI) INTERACTIONS WITH MINERAL SURFACES: CONTROLLING FACTORS AND SURFACE COMPLEXATION MODELLING</field><field name="creator">Payne, Timothy Ernest, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The objective of the work described in this thesis was to improve the scientific basis for modelling the migration of U in the sub-surface environment. The project involved: ?? studying the sorption of U on model minerals (Georgia kaolinite and ferrihydrite) in laboratory experiments ?? carrying out experimental studies of U sorption on complex natural substrates ?? studying the mechanisms influencing U retardation in the natural environment, including transformation processes of iron oxides ?? identifying chemical factors which control U sorption on model and natural substrates ?? developing a mechanistic model for U sorption on ferrihydrite and kaolinite using the surface complexation adsorption model , and ?? assessing and modelling the effect of complexing ligands on uranyl adsorption.  Uranium (VI) sorption on geological materials is influenced by a large number of factors including: pH, ionic strength, partial pressure of CO2, adsorbent loading, total amount of U present, and the presence of inorganic and organic ligands. The sorption of UO22+ typically increases with increasing pH (the 'low pH sorption edge') up to about pH 7. In systems equilibrated with air, there is a sharp decrease in sorption above this pH value (the 'high pH edge'), due to strong complexation between uranyl and carbonate. The adsorption model being used for ferrihydrite is a surface complexation model with a diffuse double layer, and both strong and weak sites for U sorption. Based on the analysis of EXAFS data, the U surface complexes were modelled as mononuclear bidentate surface complexes of the form (&amp;gtFeO2)UO20. Ternary surface complexes involving carbonate with the form (&amp;gtFeO2)UO2CO32- were also required for the best simulation of U sorption data. There was a slight decrease in U sorption on ferrihydrite in systems that contained sulfate. It was necessary to consider competition between UO22+ and SO42- for surface sites, as well as complexation between UO22+ and SO42- to model the data. The presence of citrate considerably reduced U sorption and caused dissolution of ferrihydrite. Complexation of citrate with both uranyl and ferric ions was taken into account in modelling this system. The model required the optimisation of the formation constant for a postulated mixed metal (U/Fe/citrate) aqueous complex. Humic acid increased U uptake at pH values below 7, with little effect at higher pH values.	In terms of the amount of U sorbed per gram of adsorbent, U uptake on kaolinites KGa-1 and KGa-1B was much weaker than U uptake on ferrihydrite under similar experimental conditions. Electron microscope examination showed that titanium-rich impurity phases played a major role in the sorption of U by these standard kaolinites. A relatively simple model for uranyl sorption on the model kaolinites was able to account for U sorption under a wide range of experimental conditions. The model involved only three surface reactions on two sites (&amp;gtTiOH and &amp;gtAlOH), with a non-electrostatic surface complexation model. The relative amounts of the sites were estimated from AEM results. Precipitation was taken into account in modelling the experimental data obtained with high U concentrations. The effects of sulfate and citrate on U sorption by kaolinite were also assessed and modelled. Sulfate had a small effect on U sorption, which may be explained by aqueous complexation. Citrate had a greater effect, and this was not wholly explained by the formation of aqueous U-citrate complexes. The most likely explanation would also involve competition for surface sites between U and citrate. Uranyl uptake on ferrihydrite was greatly increased by the presence of phosphate. This was not due to precipitation, and was attributed to the formation of a ternary surface complex with a proposed structure of (&amp;gtFeO2)UO2PO43-. The log K value for the formation of this complex was optimised using FITEQL. Phosphate also increased uptake of uranyl on kaolinite, and this was also attributed to the formation of ternary uranyl phosphate surface species. Uranium sorption on weathered schist samples from the vicinity of the Koongarra U deposit in northern Australia was generally similar to the model minerals (in terms of the effects of pH, ionic strength, total U, etc). Many experiments with the natural materials were spiked with an artificial U isotope (236U), which allowed adsorption (of 236U) and desorption (of 238U) to be distinguished, and provided a means of estimating the 'labile' or 'accessible' portion of the natural U content. A significant advantage of this method is that (unlike chemical extractions) it does not rely on the assumptions about the phases extracted by 'selective' reagents. Uranium sorption experiments were also carried out with Koongarra samples which had been treated with citrate / dithionite / bicarbonate (CDB) reagent to remove iron oxides. Uranium sorption was greatly decreased by the CDB extraction, which reduced the surface area of the samples by about 30-40%. To further elucidate the impact of iron minerals on U mobility in the natural environment, the transformation of synthetic ferrihydrite containing adsorbed natural uranium was studied. In these experiments, the ferrihydrite was partially converted to crystalline forms such as hematite and goethite. The uptake of an artificial uranium isotope (236U) and the leaching of 238U from the samples were then studied in adsorption / desorption experiments. The transformation of ferrihydrite to crystalline minerals substantially reduced the ability of the samples to adsorb 236U from solution. Some of the previously adsorbed 238U was irreversibly incorporated within the mineral structure during the transformation process. Therefore, transformation of iron minerals from amorphous to crystalline forms provides a possible mechanism for uranium immobilisation in the groundwater environment. In considering the overall effect on U migration, this must be balanced against the reduced ability of the transformed iron oxide to adsorb U. The experiments with the model and natural substrates demonstrated that trace impurities (such as Ti-oxides) and mineral coatings (such as ferrihydrite) can play a dominant role in U adsorption in both environmental and model systems. Although the various substrates had different affinities for adsorbing U, the effects of chemical factors, including pH, ionic strength, and carbonate complexation were similar for the different materials. This suggests that a mechanistic model for U sorption on model minerals may eventually be incorporated in geochemical transport models, and used to describe U sorption in the natural environment.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Uranium Absorption and adsorption</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Construction of the National Holocaust Memorial in Berlin</field><field name="creator">Mangos, Simone, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">At the beginning of 1998 the final round of the 1997 Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe artists?? competition was taking place in Berlin. As an artist whose work is inspired and realized in direct relation to sites, I became interested in and began to investigate the site designated for the Memorial. I discovered, that the Memorial organizers, comprised of the Federal Government of Germany, the State of Berlin and the ??Citizens Association Memorial for the Murdered Jews of Europe?? (F??rderkreis Denkmal f??r die ermordeten Juden Europas), had omitted any reference to the history of the site, and subsequently misrepresented its contemporary condition and status. To what extent does deceit play a role in the construction of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe? What bearing does it have on the completed artwork? Taking the site as a starting point, I decided to investigate the above by observing and documenting the actual stages of construction from direct first hand observation as an eye witness. This included the management and promotion of the memorial. The official ten-years long debate (1989-1999) about the memorial ostensibly represented a thorough analysis of the undertaking. But what would take place in the actual practice of constructing the national Holocaust Memorial in the new capital of reunited Germany? What would the intervention, editing and promotion of the object during the years of construction, reflect about the intentions of the German people (the Memorial organizers, the media and the public), and the intended function of the object? How would the German people receive the memorial and what would their response indicate? This research would initially take place prior to construction, as well as during construction, at a time when the realization of the actual memorial was somewhat in jeopardy. Most sections of the thesis would be written immediately following the events that took place. My research did not stop with the inauguration of the memorial, and I was thus able to observe the completed memorial??s existence and address the evident final question. Why does the resulting memorial fail to elicit an appropriate respectful response from the public? In what ways did the management, promotion and editing of, as well as activities on and around the site of the memorial, contribute to this failure? Procedures followed: Prior to formally undertaking the PhD, my investigative procedures were those of an artist and someone outside of the official discussion (without the privileges of the press, an organized lobby group or any officially recognized status) attempting to glean insight, understanding and information, as available to any member of the general public (albeit, as a foreigner). This included weekly visits to the site and photographic documentation and observation of both the allotted terrain and vicinity. Embarking on the formal PhD, the procedure is solidified by a methodical investigation and review of the press in consultation with historical sources and unpublished documents. Parallel to the investigation, I develop an exhibition of artwork that is consequential to the research. I attempt to make the work public through an exhibition in a central state museum in Berlin. General results obtained: A written account, addressing the period of construction of the memorial from 1998 to 2005 and the subsequent reception and life of the completed object, post inauguration. The thesis reconstructs and documents the stages of construction as well as the final outcome of the memorial. A body of artworks comprising sculpture, photography, video and installation has been produced out of the research. Major conclusions reached: An appraisal of the completed memorial??s reception has raised new questions about the finished object two years on from its inauguration. It presents a critical analysis of the completed memorial??s failure in an atmosphere of post World Cup euphoric indifference. A solo exhibition at the only museum in Berlin dedicated in part to a Jewish artist, as well as the opportunity to realize an artwork with a historical building in the central business district of Berlin, which is still in a state of ruin following its bombing at the end of WWII. To my knowledge, this is the only thesis on the memorial, which addresses thefindings of Nazi ruins on site in 1998, their subsequent removal and the quasisecrecy surrounding it, as well as the level of deceit in the construction process and its effects on the resulting memorial. It is the only thesis, which acknowledges and addresses the outright failure of the memorial to elicit a respectful commemoration of the Holocaust.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular characterisation of membrane transporters associated with saxitoxin biosynthesis in cyanobacteria</field><field name="creator">Pengelly, Jasper John Lobl, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The release of the neurotoxic alkaloid saxitoxin by cyanobacterial cells was previously thought to occur primarily after cell lysis, yet recent evidence also suggests active toxin export by membrane transporters.  Transporter proteins associated with STX biosynthesis in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3 (sxtF and sxtM) and Anabaena circinalis 131C (naDt) were predicted to be involved in the export of STX from cyanobacterial cells.  The main aim of this project was to characterise the transporters associated with STX biosynthesis, by investigation of their genetic prevalence, functional substrates and specific regulation.	An sxtM homologue was discovered in A. circinalis 131C, as part of an sxt cluster, and found to be uniquely associated with STX-producing strains. Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis showed that the translated sxt transporters clustered with the NorM prokaryotic MATE sub-family and membrane topology analysis predicted 12 membrane-spanning regions.  To characterise the functional substrates of the putative STX-transporters, they were heterologously expressed in the antibiotic-sensitive E. coli strain KAM32.  Expression of the sxt MATES complemented host sensitivity to the cationic fluroquinolone antibiotics, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.  Disruption of gene homologues of naDt and the sxt MATE genes in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 yielded mutant strains with increased sensitivity to the toxic organic cations, methyl viologen and acriflavine.	Transcription of the putative STX transporters, and the putative STX biosynthesis gene sxtA, was studied in C. raciborskii T3 and A. circinalis 131C under alkali and Na+ stress. Alkali stress (pH 9) decreased total STX levels in A. circinalis 131C and was correlated with a down-regulation of the putative transport and biosynthetic genes.  In C. raciborskii T3, alkali stress promoted higher extracellular but lower intracellular STX levels, which also correlated with large increases in transcription of the putative STX transport genes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Saxitoxin</field><field name="subject">MATE transporter</field><field name="subject">Anabaena</field><field name="subject">Cylindrospermopsis</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41429</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antibody and Antigen in Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia</field><field name="creator">Newman, Peter Michael, Pathology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Immune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a potentially serious complication of heparin therapy and is associated with antibodies directed against a complex of platelet factor 4 (PF4) and heparin. Early diagnosis of HIT is important to reduce morbidity and mortality. I developed an enzyme immunoassay that detects the binding of HIT IgG to PF4-heparin in the fluid phase. This required techniques to purify and biotinylate PF4. The fluid phase assay produces consistently low background and can detect low levels of anti-PF4-heparin. It is suited to testing alternative anticoagulants because, unlike in an ELISA, a clearly defined amount of antigen is available for antibody binding. I was able to detect anti-PF4-heparin IgG in 93% of HIT patients. I also investigated cross-reactivity of anti-PF4-heparin antibodies with PF4 complexed to alternative heparin-like anticoagulants. Low molecular weight heparins cross-reacted with 88% of the sera from HIT patients while half of the HIT sera weakly cross-reacted with PF4-danaparoid (Orgaran). The thrombocytopenia and thrombosis of most of these patients resolved during danaparoid therapy, indicating that detection of low affinity antibodies to PF4-danaparoid by immunoassay may not be an absolute contraindication for danaparoid administration. While HIT patients possess antibodies to PF4-heparin, I observed that HIT antibodies will also bind to PF4 alone adsorbed on polystyrene ELISA wells but not to soluble PF4 in the absence of heparin. Having developed a technique to affinity-purify anti-PF4-heparin HIT IgG, I provide the first estimates of the avidity of HIT IgG. HIT IgG displayed relatively high functional affinity for both PF4-heparin (Kd=7-30nM) and polystyrene adsorbed PF4 alone (Kd=20-70nM). Furthermore, agarose beads coated with PF4 alone were almost as effective as beads coated with PF4 plus heparin in depleting HIT plasmas of anti-PF4-heparin antibodies. I conclude that the HIT antibodies which bind to polystyrene adsorbed PF4 without heparin are largely the same IgG molecules that bind PF4-heparin and thus most HIT antibodies bind epitope(s) on PF4 and not epitope(s) formed by part of a PF4 molecule and part of a heparin molecule. Binding of PF4 to heparin (optimal) or polystyrene/agarose (sub-optimal) promotes recognition of this epitope. Under conditions that are more physiological and sensitive than previous studies, I observed that affinity-purified HIT IgG will cause platelet aggregation upon the addition of heparin. Platelets activated with HIT IgG increased their release and surface expression of PF4. I quantitated the binding of affinity-purified HIT 125I-IgG to platelets as they activate in a plasma milieu. Binding of the HIT IgG was dependent upon heparin and some degree of platelet activation. Blocking the platelet Fc??? receptor-II with the monoclonal antibody IV.3 did not prevent HIT IgG binding to activated platelets. I conclude that anti-PF4-heparin IgG is the only component specific to HIT plasma that is required to induce platelet aggregation. The Fab region of HIT IgG binds to PF4-heparin that is on the surface of activated platelets. I propose that only then does the Fc portion of the bound IgG activate other platelets via the Fc receptor. My data support a dynamic model of platelet activation where released PF4 enhances further antibody binding and more release.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">heparin</field><field name="subject">thrombocytopenia</field><field name="subject">platelet factor 4</field><field name="subject">PF4</field><field name="subject">platelets</field><field name="subject">antibody avidity</field><field name="subject">antibody affinity</field><field name="subject">epitope</field><field name="subject">heparinoid</field><field name="subject">low molecular weight heparin</field><field name="subject">HIT</field><field name="subject">HITS</field><field name="subject">HITT</field><field name="subject">HAT</field><field name="subject">white clot syndrome</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A pragmatic approach to area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Ahmed, Nadeem, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Success of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) largely depends on whether the deployed network can provide desired area coverage with acceptable network lifetime. In hostile or harsh environments such as enemy territories in battlefields, fire or chemical spills, it is impossible to deploy the sensor nodes in a predeter- mined regular topology to guarantee adequate coverage. Random deployment is thus more practical and feasible for large target areas. On the other hand, random deployment of sensors is highly susceptible to the occurrence of coverage holes in the target area. A potential solution for enhancing the existing coverage achieved by random deployments involves the use of mobility capable sensors that would help fill the coverage holes. This thesis seeks to address the problem of determining the current coverage achieved by the non-deterministic deployment of static sensor nodes and subsequently enhancing the coverage using mobile sensors.  The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of MAPC (Mobility Assisted Probabilistic Coverage), a distributed protocol for ensuring area coverage in hybrid wireless sensor networks. The primary contribution is a pragmatic approach to sensor coverage and maintenance that we hope would lower the technical barriers to its field deployment. Most of the assumptions made in the MAPC protocol are realistic and implementable in real-life applications e.g., practical boundary estimation, coverage calculations based on a realistic sensing model, and use of movement triggering thresholds based on real radio characteristics etc. The MAPC is a comprehensive three phase protocol. In the first phase, the static sensors calculate the area coverage using the Probabilistic Coverage Algorithm (PCA). This is a deviation from the idealistic assumption used in the binary detection model, wherein a sensor can sense accurately within a well defined (usually circular) region. Static sensors execute the PCA algorithm, in a distributed way, to identify any holes in the coverage. In the second phase, MAPC scheme moves the mobile nodes in an optimal manner to fill these uncovered locations. For different types of initial deployments, the proposed movement algorithms consume only 30-40% of the energy consumed by the basic virtual force algorithm. In addition, this thesis addresses the problem of coverage loss due to damaged and energy depleted nodes. The problem has been formulated as an Integer Linear Program and implementable heuristics are developed that perform close to optimal solutions. By replacing in-operational nodes in phase three, MAPC scheme ensures the continuous operation of the WSN.  Experiments with real mote hardware were conducted to validate the boundary and coverage estimation part of the MAPC protocol. Extensive discrete event simulations (using NS2) were also performed for the complete MAPC protocol and the results demonstrate that MAPC can enhance and maintain the area coverage by efficiently moving mobile sensor nodes to strategic positions in the uncovered area.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coverage Issues.</field><field name="subject">Wireless sensor networks.</field><field name="subject">Computer networks.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44280</field></doc><doc><field name="title">THE SMELL OF DISLOCATION -  AMBERGRIS, a novel, and The smell of dislocation: Olfactory imagery in selected works of Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="creator">Petter, Sylvia Astrid, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">My thesis comprises a creative and a critical component. The creative component is a novel entitled Ambergris. Ambergris in both its synthetic and natural states is a fixative to contain the evanescence of scent; it is also a metaphor for my novel which is set against the background of perfume making and deals with expatriates and migrants. Through the formal structure of the novel I hope to make a contribution to literature and to engage with critical and social concerns of the expatriate condition such as the place of home, the experience of longing, and whether or not one can really &#145;belong&#146;. My critical essay is entitled "The Smell of Dislocation: Olfactory Imagery in Selected Works of Janette Turner Hospital". The words 'olfactory imagery' may seem to be a contradiction in terms due to the difficulty of containing scent and the paucity of olfactory language. Scent, however, has strong links to memory and place, and through its non-visual and associative qualities may bypass language. I argue that engagement with the representation of scent in fiction can expand the current categories of formalist criticism found in narrative theory and Creative Writing pedagogy. My essay examines how Janette Turner Hospital employs olfactory imagery in her &#145;Australian&#146; stories and novels to represent the recurring themes of dislocation underscoring the lives of many of her characters. Despite the difficulty of representing smell in fiction, I explore possibilities for thematic considerations triggered by the percept of smell as experienced by Janette Turner Hospital's characters, narrators, and possibly readers. Such explorations deal with the links between scent and memory, the liminality of both scent and the expatriate condition, as well as a narrative methodology which considers psychological and cognitive reactions to scent and culminates in their 'mapping' and the 'slippage' of personal associations.  Both thesis components examine expatriate identity and approach its fictional representation through the filter of expatriate perceptions. Awareness by readers of such perceptions may serve to amplify their own appreciation of the dislocation of such identities in fiction, and in our current world of growing and even shifting diasporas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Janette Turner Hospital</field><field name="subject">Olfaction</field><field name="subject">Dislocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41530</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural mechanisms involved in cross-limb transfer of strength and ballistic motor learning</field><field name="creator">Lee, Michael, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate the potential mechanisms and sites of neural adaptations that mediate cross-limb transfer of strength and motor learning that can occur subsequent to unilateral training. Better understanding of the mechanisms should allow therapeutic benefits of this effect to be assessed. There are two main classes of mechanisms that could contribute to cross-limb transfer. The first is described by the ??bilateral access?? hypothesis, which suggests that neural adaptations induced by training reside in bilaterally projecting motor areas that are accessible to the untrained (ipsilateral) hemisphere during task execution to facilitate performance. According to the alternative ??cross-activation?? hypothesis, activation of the untrained hemisphere during unilateral training leads to adaptations in the untrained hemisphere that cause improved performance with the opposite untrained limb. A series of studies were conducted in this research. We directly tested the cross-activation hypothesis via a reliable twitch interpolation technique involving transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Four-weeks of strength training for the right wrist increased neural drive (from the untrained motor cortex) to the untrained left wrist. The data demonstrate that strength training of one limb can influence the efficacy of corticospinal pathways that project to the opposite untrained limb, consistent with the cross-activation hypothesis.  To investigate the contribution of each hemisphere in cross-limb transfer, we applied repetitive TMS (rTMS) to the trained or the untrained motor cortex to disrupt brain processing after unilateral ballistic training. Learning to produce ballistic movements requires optimization of motor drive to the relevant muscles in a way that resembles high-force contractions performed during strength training. Ballistic skill transferred rapidly to the untrained hand and the improved performance was accompanied by bilateral increases in corticospinal excitability. Performance improvement in each hand was specifically suppressed by rTMS of the opposite hemisphere. Thus the motor cortex ipsilateral to the trained hand is critically altered during unilateral training; and neural adaptations within this untrained hemisphere are crucial in cross-limb transfer of ballistic skill. Overall, the data are in agreement with the cross-activation hypothesis for high-force and ballistic tasks, although they do not exclude the potential involvement of bilateral access mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cross-limb transfer</field><field name="subject">Cross education</field><field name="subject">Strength training</field><field name="subject">Motor learning</field><field name="subject">Transcranial magnetic stimulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A metabolic approach to the GABAergic system</field><field name="creator">Nasrallah, Fatma, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Here, we investigated the effects of modulation of the GABAergic system using a targeted neuropharmacological, 1H/13C NMR spectroscopy and metabolomic approach in Guinea pig cortical brain slices. The effects of exogenous GABA, agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators at GABAA receptors were described and classified on the basis of metabolic activity; this corresponded to receptor location rather than pharmacology. The effects of agonists and antagonists at the GABAB receptor were described and classified into inhibitory and excitatory components, consistent with context dependent outcomes of receptor activity. Metabolic evidence for GABAC mediated activity in the cerebral cortex was identified for the first time indicating a strong role for this receptor in the control of neuronal activity. Inhibition of GABA uptake was examined using inhibitors of these transporters. The major effect of individual transporter subtype blockade was increased synaptic inhibition. The paradoxical activity of the GABA-transaminase inhibitor vigabatrin was resolved, with a direct demonstration of a single inhibitory mechanism mediated via this drug, via a mechanism also induced by antagonists at the GABAC receptor. These data were then integrated using multivariate statistics to identify 5 subclasses of activity which corresponded to receptor location (e.g. synaptic or extrasynaptic) rather than receptor pharmacology.

Increasing evidence suggests that precarious employment is associated with poorer occupational health and safety (OHS) outcomes in terms of injury rates, disease risk and psychological wellbeing. This study used a cross sectional survey of 255 employees to compare the OHS experiences of temporary (N = 156, 61.2%) and permanent (N = 99, 38.8%) workers employed in three companies involved in the seasonal processing of primary agriculture products (dairy, meat and produce) in two regions of New Zealand.  This research identified a clearly definable group of temporary workers (seasonals), who exhibit different characteristics to those commonly associated with precarious employment as they have an expectation of reasonable lengths of fairly secure employment (seasons exceed eight months).  Many respondents only undertook one period of employment per year and were re-engaged in subsequent seasons.  There are limited opportunities for alternative employment adjacent to these plants.  This creates a dependant employment market, potentially putting labour in a weak bargaining position.  This is countered by a high overall level of union membership (N = 181, 71%) and the operation of collective employment contracts.  This may be atypical in seasonal industries.  Injury numbers were similar (permanent N = 49, 49.5%, temporary N = 73, 46.8%) and serious injuries (permanent N = 23, 23.2%, temporary N = 31, 19.9%).  Once a factor was introduced to compensate for exposure time, thereby creating a frequency rate, results showed a statistically significant difference with temporary workers suffering injuries and serious injuries with less exposure than their permanent counterparts (t (193.821) = -5.566, p &lt; 0.05 and (t (236.928) = -2.160, p &lt; 0.05 respectively).  There was a significant difference in chronic injuries with permanent employees being more likely to have a chronic injury (F91,253) = 20.456, p&lt;0.05).  Most importantly, using the General Linear Model (logistic regression), when all other influences were controlled for, this research found employment status remained influential in determining whether a respondent was injured at work or not.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PRECARIOUS EMPLOYMENT</field><field name="subject">TEMPORARY WORKERS</field><field name="subject">SEASONAL</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41337</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Conservation genetics and reproduction in three Australian marsupial species</field><field name="creator">Miller, Emily Jane, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many Australian marsupial species require active population management to ensure their survival in the wild. Such management should be based on a sound understanding of species biology. This thesis explores how knowledge of reproduction and genetics can be applied to the management of three Australian marsupial species faced with contrasting management scenarios. The ??vulnerable?? greater bilby is the sole remaining desert bandicoot in Australia. They are a secretive, solitary species whose mating system is unclear. This research examined temporal changes in genetic diversity within two captive breeding programs utilising different management strategies. Using seven microsatellite loci, this study found the regular translocation of new individuals into the population maintained genetic diversity. Parentage analysis revealed the bilby to have a promiscious mating system. Sires and non-sires could not be distinguished by morphological traits.  The tammar wallaby is a polygynous, solitary species that is threatened on mainland Australia, but overabundant on some offshore islands. The population genetics of tammars from the Abrolhos Islands in Western Australia were examined using nine autosomal and four Y-linked microsatellite loci, and mitochondrial DNA. There was a relationship between island size, population size and genetic diversity. The Abrolhos populations have significantly lower genetic diversity and are more inbred than mainland tammars and all sampled populations were significantly differentiated. The Abrolhos and mainland populations should be treated as separate Management Units.  The eastern grey kangaroo is a gregarious, polygynous species that is often locally overabundant. To determine traits influencing male reproductive success, behavioural, morphological, physiological and genetic data were examined and showed dominance status, body size and testosterone concentrations were important factors. Sires were also significantly more heterozygous and genetically dissimilar to females, than non-sires. As body condition influences individual fitness, and management decisions; five body condition indices (BCI) calculated from morphological data were validated using serum biochemistry and haematology in two kangaroo populations with contrasting body condition. Blood parameters were found to be more reliable indicators of condition, questioning the credibility of BCIs currently used in management. These studies demonstrate the importance of reproductive and genetic data in assisting wildlife management, regardless of a species conservation status.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mating system</field><field name="subject">conservation genetics</field><field name="subject">reproductive success</field><field name="subject">body condition</field><field name="subject">phylogenetics</field><field name="subject">wildlife management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42779</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cross-cultural study of Australian and Chinese university academics?? work motivation</field><field name="creator">Li, Feng Edward, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examined university academics?? valence for teaching and research, and the relationships between the valence and self-efficacy for teaching and research, with an Australian and a Chinese sample.

In this work, new techniques and strategies were developed to improve the quality of cartilage produced in vitro by methods of tissue engineering. Chondrocytes were isolated from the hip and knee joints of aborted human foetuses. The cells were expanded and seeded into scaffolds and the seeded scaffolds were cultured in perfusion bioreactors. The quality of the final cartilage constructs was assessed biochemically by measuring their content of glycosaminoglycan (GAG), total collagen and collagen type II and histologically by staining cross-sections of the constructs for GAG, collagen type I and collagen type II. The amount of proteoglycan released in the culture medium was also measured at regular intervals.  Proteoglycans from tissue-engineered cartilage and spent culture medium were compared and analysed for degradation and capability of aggregation. During monolayer expansion, the chondrocyte differentiation indices decreased, the cell size increased and the percentage of cells present in G2/S??M phase decreased with the greatest changes occurring during the first passage. Expanding chondrocytes in PGA or PGA??alginate scaffolds produced cells with a higher level of differentiation than monolayer-expanded cells. However, PGA and PGA??alginate could not be justified as suitable systems for the routine expansion of chondrocytes mainly because of the relatively low cell proliferation obtained. Two new methods for seeding of cells into scaffolds were investigated using PGA and PGA??alginate as scaffold materials. Both methods produced high seeding efficiencies and homogeneous distribution of cells.  When seeded PGA??alginate scaffolds were cultured in perfusion bioreactors, they produced good quality constructs with higher concentrations of extracellular matrix (ECM) components compared with previously described methods. However, when seeded PGA scaffolds were cultured in perfusion bioreactors, they produced small constructs of poor quality. Investigation of the effect of medium flow rate on the PGA scaffolds showed that a low flow rate was needed at the beginning of the culture to enable the cells to form a framework onto which other synthesised elements could deposit. Applying a gradual increase in medium flow rate to PGA scaffolds cultured in perfusion bioreactors solved the shrinkage problem and produced constructs with quality similar to those produced using PGA??alginate scaffolds.  A novel compression bioreactor that mimicked the physiological stimulation of cartilage by joint movement was constructed. Using this bioreactor, compressed constructs showed significantly higher wet weight and higher concentrations of GAG, total collagen and collagen type II compared with non-compressed constructs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chondrocyte</field><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">Cartilage</field><field name="subject">Bioreactor</field><field name="subject">perfusion</field><field name="subject">Compression</field><field name="subject">Differentiation</field><field name="subject">Seeding</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42945</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of scaffold geometries on spatial cell distribution</field><field name="creator">Ko, Henry Chung Hung, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A limitation to engineering viable thick tissues (greater than a few hundred microns in thickness) has been the lack of vascularisation and a vascular supply. A key element in engineering such tissues is the generation of a supporting scaffold with a defined and wellcharacterized architecture. To date relatively little attention has been paid to characterization. The objective of this research was to develop well-characterized structures which will inform the rational design of the next generation of engineered thick tissues. Specifically, this research aimed to test combinations of various culturing environments, cell mono- and co-cultures, and scaffold architectures; develop improved imaging techniques and structural/spatial analytical methods to characterise porous polymer scaffolds; and use various spatial and morphological measures to quantify the relationships between scaffold geometric structure and cell distribution. Isotropic and anisotropic pore scaffolds were manufactured and then processed with nondestructive and destructive imaging methods, and characterised using image analysis methods to measure geometric parameters such as the degree of anisotropy/isotropy, porosity, and fractal parameters of pore and strut networks. Cells were introduced into scaffolds using a range of seeding methods and cultured in static and hydrodynamic environments. Quantification of the spatial cell distribution in cell-seeded scaffolds was done with first-order spatial statistics and fractal analysis. Findings comparing various destructive and non-destructive imaging methods found that cryotape cryohistology was the most accurate method for processing bare polymer scaffolds and eliminated histological artefacts common to other techniques. It was found with the various image analysis methods, surface and internal scaffold geometric architectures were strongly isotropic for porogen-fused porogen-leached scaffolds and anisotropic for TIPS scaffolds. For both isotropic and anisotropic pore scaffolds, collagen hydrogel infusion and droplet methods gave the highest cell seeding efficiencies (at 100% efficiency). The key finding in this study was that first-order spatial statistics and fractal analysis of cell distribution revealed that the geometric structure of the scaffolds had the strongest effect on spatial cell infiltration and distribution compared to the influence of culture environment or mono- and co-culture. Isotropic pore scaffolds had a higher level of cell distribution. Further work with optimizing the growth environment parameters, and utilizing collagen-infused cell-seeded scaffolds, may assist in achieving better cell growth. The work presented therefore provides the analytical basis for the rational design of tissue engineering scaffolds.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">tissue engineering</field><field name="subject">vascularisation</field><field name="subject">biomaterial scaffold</field><field name="subject">image analysis</field><field name="subject">scaffold architecture</field><field name="subject">spatial cell distribution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43342</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Asymmetrical dispersal in simulation analysis</field><field name="creator">Maio, Gianluca, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Asymmetrical dispersal is when dispersal rates differ in opposite directions. This is expected to be common in natural populations. This work aims to study the symmetrical and asymmetrical dispersal through the use of a simulation program, simuPOP. The main questions were (i) "what are the differences between asymmetrical and symmetrical dispersal in relation to genetic differentiation and equilibrium?" and (ii) "Is it possible to identify asymmetrical dispersal structure from observed patterns of genetic differentiation between populations, and variation within populations?". To address these questions, simulations were conducted with two and three subpopulations subject by three different dispersal rate contrasts and several spatial patterns of dispersal. Variables were estimated at drift-dispersal equilibrium included genetic differentiation between subpopulations (&#952;) and heterozygosity. With pairwise &#952; for three subpopulations it was possible to determine whether the metapopulations were subject to symmetrical or asymmetrical dispersal and sometimes to identify the structure of dispersal. Equilibrium heterozygosities did not aid diagnosis of asymmetrical dispersal patterns. I also checked the applicability of two predictions originally made for symmetrical dispersal: Wright's expectations for &#952; at equilibrium, and Whitlock's expectations fro time to half of equilibrium &#952;. In most cases these expectations were not applicable.

However, the use of 1, 25 (OH)2VD3 is hampered due to the development of hypercalcaemia. Current treatment using hepatic arterial delivery of drug solution is inconvenient since repetitive invasive treatments are required. This work aims to tackle this problem by utilizing crosslinked microspheres prepared by suspension polymerization as a carrier to control the release of 1, 25 (OH)2VD3 or hydrophobic drug in general at targeted sites over a long period. Poly(vinyl neodecanoate crosslinked ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) microspheres in the size range of 35 &#61549;m were prepared via suspension polymerization. Different parameters in suspension polymerization such as temperature, concentration and crosslinker percentage were studied in details. The effect of stabilizer on the formation of spheres was carefully investigated by using RAFT polymerization to produce various structures of the stabilizer, poly (vinyl pyrrolidone). Core- shell microspheres were also produced to enhance the hydrophilicity of the surface of microspheres. Hydrophobic drugs were loaded to these microspheres after reaction by the evaporation method. These microspheres were then used for drug loading and drug release study. Release study has shown that up to 10% of drug was released after 40 days. Cytotoxicity test reveals the suitability of this polymer for application in biomedical field. The MTT assay of Clofazimine loaded microspheres on the colorectal cancer cell lines HT29 has shown that the cell number was decreased about 50% after drug treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug loading</field><field name="subject">Microspheres</field><field name="subject">Liver cancer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41528</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of community-based protest movement continuity against construction projects</field><field name="creator">Teo, More Mei Melissa, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the social forces that shape and sustain community-based protest against proposed projects in the construction industry. It builds on current research which highlights the tendency for community concerns about proposed developments to escalate into long-term protests that have far-reaching implications for both the construction industry and the local community. A theoretical framework merges the facilitative role of movement networks, contagion theory and the cultural experience of activism to investigate their relationship with protest movement continuity. Three research propositions emerged from the model and are investigated within a grounded theory framework. The research method adopts a single case study of a mature protest movement and utilises a triangulation of methods that integrates qualitative and ethnographic approaches across two interrelated phases of data collection that continues to the point of theoretical saturation. The data is analysed in three ways: A thematic story telling approach is used to ground the data derived so as to identify patterns of influences on protest participation and their effect on movement continuity. Concept maps and network diagrams are also used to connect the themes and guide the use of stories to reveal influences on movement continuity.  The research concludes by proposing a refined theoretical model of protest movement continuity against construction projects. The model also forms the basis for a grounded theory which consisted of three interrelated parts. The first part concludes that protest networks are deliberately complex and dynamic to cope with the transient nature of protest participation and promote movement continuity. The second part points to the contagious influence of network to generate two opposing network conditions that are both conducive and detrimental to movement continuity. The last part points to the importance of social relationships as shaping the context in which cultural meanings of activism are understood and have a direct effect on sustaining movement continuity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protest</field><field name="subject">Construction projects</field><field name="subject">Stakeholder management</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust speaker verification system</field><field name="creator">Nosratighods, Mohaddeseh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Identity verification or biometric recognition systems play an important role in our daily lives. Applications include Automatic Teller Machines (ATM), banking and share information retrieval, and personal verification for credit cards. Among the biometric techniques, authentication of speakers by his/her voice is of great importance, since it employs a non-invasive approach and is the only available modality in many applications. However,the performance of Automatic Speaker Verification (ASV) systems degrades significantly under adverse conditions which cause recordings from the same speaker to be different.The objective of this research is to investigate and develop robust techniques for performing automatic speaker recognition over various channel conditions, such as telephony and recorded microphone speech. This research is shown to improve the robustness of ASV systems in three main areas of feature extraction, speaker modelling and score normalization. At the feature level, a new set of dynamic features, termed Delta Cepstral Energy (DCE) is proposed, instead of traditional delta cepstra, which not only greatly reduces thedimensionality of the feature vector compared with delta and delta-delta cepstra, but is also shown to provide the same performance for matched testing and training conditions on TIMIT and a subset of the NIST 2002 dataset. The concept of speaker entropy, which conveys the information contained in a speaker's speech based on the extracted features, facilitates comparative evaluation of the proposed methods. In addition, Frequency Modulation features are combined in a complementary manner with the Mel Frequency CepstralCoefficients (MFCCs) to improve the performance of the ASV system under channel variability of various types. The proposed fused system shows a relative reduction of up to 23% in Equal Error Rate (EER) over the MFCC-based system when evaluated on the NIST 2008 dataset. Currently, the main challenge in speaker modelling is channel variability across different sessions. A recent approach to channel compensation, based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) is Nuisance Attribute Projection (NAP). The proposed multi-component approach to NAP, attempts to compensate for the main sources of inter-session variations through an additional optimization criteria, to allow more accurate estimates of the most dominant channel artefacts and to improve the system performance under mismatched training and test conditions. Another major issue in speaker recognition is that the variability of score distributions due to incompletely modelled regions of the feature space can produce segments of the test speech that are poorly matched to the claimed speaker model. A segment selection technique in score normalization is proposed that relies only on discriminative and reliable segments of the test utterance to verify the speaker. This approach is particularly useful in noisy conditions where using speech activity detection is not reliable at the feature level. Another source of score variability comes from the fact that not all phonemes are equally discriminative. To address this, a new score re-weighting technique is applied to likelihood values based on the discriminative level of each Gaussian component, i.e. each particular region of the feature space. It is found that a limited number of Gaussian mixtures, herein termed discriminative components are responsible for the overall performance, and that inclusion of the other non-discriminative components may only degrade the system performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Delta Cesptral Energy</field><field name="subject">Speaker Recognition</field><field name="subject">Score Modiffication</field><field name="subject">Channel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42796</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of structured nonbinary quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check codes</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yue, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the rediscovery, LDPC codes attract a large amount of research efforts. In 1998, nonbinary LDPC codes were firstly investigated and the results shown that they are better than their binary counterparts in performance. Recently, there is always a requirement from the industry to design applied nonbinary LDPC codes.  In this dissertation, we firstly propose a novel class of quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes. This class of QC-LDPC codes embraces both linear encoding complexity and excellent compatibility in various degree distributions and nonbinary expansions. We show by simulation results that our proposed QC-LDPC codes perform as well as their comparable counterparts. However, this proposed code structure is more flexible in designing. This feature may show its power when we change the code length and rate adaptively. Further more, we present two algorithms to generate codes with short girth and better girth distribution. The two algorithms are designed based on progressive edge growth (PEG) algorithm and they are specifically designed for quasi-cyclic structure. The simulation results show the improvement they achieved. In this thesis, we also investigate the believe propagation based iterative algorithms for decoding of nonbinary LDPC codes. The algorithms include sum-product (SP) algorithm, SP algorithm using fast Fourier transform, min-sum (MS) algorithm and complexity reduced extended min-sum (EMS) algorithm. In particular, we present the proposed modified min-sum algorithm with threshold filtering which further reduces the computation complexity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LDPC.</field><field name="subject">Error control coding.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43616</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial data quality management</field><field name="creator">He, Ying, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The applications of geographic information systems (GIS) in various areas have highlighted the importance of data quality. Data quality research has been given a priority by GIS academics for three decades. However, the outcomes of data quality research have not been sufficiently translated into practical applications. Users still need a GIS capable of storing, managing and manipulating data quality information. To fill this gap, this research aims to investigate how we can develop a tool that effectively and efficiently manages data quality information to aid data users to better understand and assess the quality of their GIS outputs. Specifically, this thesis aims:  1.	To develop a framework for establishing a systematic linkage between data quality indicators and appropriate uncertainty models; 2.	To propose an object-oriented data quality model for organising and documenting data quality information; 3.	To create data quality schemas for defining and storing the contents of metadata databases; 4.	To develop a new conceptual model of data quality management; 5.	To develop and implement a prototype system for enhancing the capability of data quality management in commercial GIS.  Based on reviews of error and uncertainty modelling in the literature, a conceptual framework has been developed to establish the systematic linkage between data quality elements and appropriate error and uncertainty models. To overcome the limitations identified in the review and satisfy a series of requirements for representing data quality, a new object-oriented data quality model has been proposed.  It enables data quality information to be documented and stored in a multi-level structure and to be integrally linked with spatial data to allow access, processing and graphic visualisation. The conceptual model for data quality management is proposed where a data quality storage model, uncertainty models and visualisation methods are three basic components. This model establishes the processes involved when managing data quality, emphasising on the integration of uncertainty modelling and visualisation techniques. The above studies lay the theoretical foundations for the development of a prototype system with the ability to manage data quality. Object-oriented approach, database technology and programming technology have been integrated to design and implement the prototype system within the ESRI ArcGIS software. The object-oriented approach allows the prototype to be developed in a more flexible and easily maintained manner. The prototype allows users to browse and access data quality information at different levels. Moreover, a set of error and uncertainty models are embedded within the system. With the prototype, data quality elements can be extracted from the database and automatically linked with the appropriate error and uncertainty models, as well as with their implications in the form of simple maps. This function results in proposing a set of different uncertainty models for users to choose for assessing how uncertainty inherent in the data can affect their specific application. It will significantly increase the users' confidence in using data for a particular situation.  To demonstrate the enhanced capability of the prototype, the system has been tested against the real data. The implementation has shown that the prototype can efficiently assist data users, especially non-expert users, to better understand data quality and utilise it in a more practical way. The methodologies and approaches for managing quality information presented in this thesis should serve as an impetus for supporting further research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data quality management.</field><field name="subject">Data quality.</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty model.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43323</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low power processor design</field><field name="creator">Zhou, Yu, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Power consumption is a critical design issue in embedded processors. As part of our low power processor design project, this thesis work aims to reduce power consumption on two typical processor components: Register File (RF), and Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU).  Register File is one of the most power hungry components in the processor, consuming about 20% of the processor power. The ALU is the working horse in the processor, responsible for almost all basic computing operations. Although ALU does not consume as high power as the register file, we observe that it can be power intensive in terms of power dissipation per silicon area unit and may result in a thermal hot spot in the processor.  Existing approaches to reduce power on the register file and ALU are effective. However, most of them either entail extensive hardware design efforts, or require a significant amount of work on post-compilation software code modification. The approaches proposed in this thesis avoid such problems. We only customize the internal structure of the processor components and keep the components&#146; interface to other system parts intact, so that the customization to a component is transparent to its external hardware design and no modification/alteration to other hardware components or to the software code is required. This customization strategy is well suitable to our whole low power processor design project and can be applied to any customization of an existing system for a given application.  We have applied our customization approaches to a set of benchmarks in a variety of application domains. Our experimental results show that the power savings on register file are in a range from 18.8% to 45.5%, an average of 29.7% register file power can be saved. For the arithmetic and logic unit, the power savings are from 43.5% to 49.6% and the average saving is 46.9% as compared to the original designs.  We also combine the customization of both the ALU and the register file. With the customizing of the ALU and the register file simultaneously, the processor power consumption can be reduced from 3.9% to 10.1%; on average, 6.44% processor power can be saved.  Most importantly, the power saving achievement is at the cost of neither hardware complexity nor processor performance, and the implementation is extremely straightforward and can be easily incorporated into a processor design environment, such as ASIPMeister  (a design tool, to automatically generate a VHDL model for application specificinstruction set processors) used in our research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Register files</field><field name="subject">Low power</field><field name="subject">ALU</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mounting evidence: Traces of things to come</field><field name="creator">Chan, Janet Bick Lai, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis documents a project that investigates the nature of painting in the digital age. Accounts of ??what painting is?? have focused on the quality of its product, its production process, and its relationship with the artworld. This thesis describes how the student has developed a form of digital painting practice that consciously engages with and reconstructs the aesthetic space once occupied by Chinese landscape painting. The works combine both realist and surrealist techniques in a way that transgresses the processes and conventions of traditional Chinese painting while at the same time appropriates its presentation format. Drawing on popular culture??s fascination with forensic science, the artist plays with physical evidence and literally generates mountains out of molehills. In manipulating proofs of where things have been, she creates a fantasy of how things can become when taken out of context. Focusing on the legal system as a symbol of the superiority of Western civilisation, the project explores the ??majesty?? of justice as it is manifested in the everyday administration of criminal cases, where the prosecution builds its argument out of the fragments of evidence collected, analysed and presented as a coherent story of actions and intentions.  Mountains are evocative symbols for the justice system. Lofty mountains depicted in Chinese painting are, like Western justice, fascinating, awe-inspiring and spiritual realms that are beyond the reach of most ordinary people.  Mountains are often sacred places where believers pay pilgrimage to seek health and longevity and where scholars and intellectuals seek self-improvement and enlightenment. If drawing is a way of making marks, this project turns the act of drawing upside down. Just like the forensic scientist, the artist makes visible the traces created by objects by ??dusting?? objects with powder and ??lifting?? the traces on sticky tapes. These traces are then converted into digital images using a computer scanner. In the same way that a prosecutor puts together a criminal case, the artist builds cases from the evidence that has been made visible. Instead of making a direct mark, the artist ??paints?? the image using the palettes of physical traces as pigments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital art</field><field name="subject">Painting</field><field name="subject">Fine arts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42058</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthetic equity and franked debt: capital markets savings cures</field><field name="creator">Rumble, Tony, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Micro-economic reform is a primary objective of modern Australian socio-economic policy. The key outcome targetted by this reform is increased efficiency, measured by a range of factors, including cost reduction, increased savings, and a more facilitative environment for business activity. These benefits are sought by the proponents of reform as part of a push to increase national prosperity, but concerns that social equity is undermined by it are expressed by opponents of that reform. The debate between efficiency and equity is raging in current Australian tax policy, a key site for micro-economic reform.  As Government Budget restructuring occurs in Australia, demographic change (eg, the ageing population) undermines the ability of public funded welfare to provide retirement benefits. Responsibility for self-funded retirement is an important contributor to increasing private savings. Investment in growth assets such as corporate stock is increasing in Australia, however concerns about volatility of asset values and yield stimulate the importance of investment risk management techniques. Financial contract innovation utilising financial derivatives is a dominant mechanism for that risk management. Synthetic equity products which are characterised by capital protection and enhanced yield are popular and efficient equity risk management vehicles, and are observed globally, particularly in the North American market. Financial contract innovation, risk management using financial derivatives, and synthetic equity products suffer from an adverse tax regulatory response in Australia, which deprives Australian investors from access to important savings vehicles.  The negative Australian tax response stems from anachronistic legislation and jurisprudence, which emphasises tax outcomes based on legal form. The pinnacle of this approach is the tax law insistence on characterisation of financial contracts as either debt or equity, despite some important financial similarities between these two asset types. Since derivatives produce transactions with novel legal forms this approach is unresponsive to innovation. The negative tax result also stems from a perception that the new products are tax arbitrage vehicles, offering tax benefits properly available to investment in stocks, which is thought to be inappropriate when the new products resemble debt positions (particularly when they are capital protected and yield enhanced). The negative tax response reflects administrative concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage. This approach seeks to impose tax linearity by proxy: rather than utilising systemic reform to align the tax treatment of debt and equity, the current strategy simply denies the equity tax benefits to a variety of innovative financial contracts. It deprives Australians of efficiency enhancing savings products, which because of an adverse tax result are unattractive to investors.  The weakness of the current approach is illustrated by critical analysis of three key current and proposed tax laws: the ???debt dividend??? rules in sec. 46D Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the ???Tax Act???); the 1997 Budget measures (which seek to integrate related stock and derivative positions); and the proposals in the Taxation of Financial Arrangements Issues Paper (which include a market value tax accounting treatment for ???traded equity,??? and propose a denial of the tax benefits for risk managed equity investments).  The thesis develops a model for financial analysis of synthetic equity products to verify the efficiency claims made for them. The approach is described as the ???Tax ReValue??? model. The Tax ReValue approach isolates the enhanced investment returns possible for synthetic equity, and the model is tested by application to the leading Australian synthetic equity product, the converting preference share. The conclusions reached are that the converting preference share provides the key benefits of enhanced investment return and lower capital costs to its corporate issuer. This financial efficiency analysis is relied upon to support the assertion that a facilitative tax response to such products is appropriate. The facilitative response can be delivered by a reformulation of the existing tax rules, or by systemic reform.  The reformulation of the existing tax rules is articulated by a Rule of Reason, which is proposed in the thesis as the basis for the allocation and retention of the equity tax benefits. To avoid concerns about taxpayer equity and revenue leakage the Rule of Reason proposes a Two Step approach to the allocation of the equity tax benefits to synthetics. The financial analysis is used to quantify non-tax benefits of synthetic equity products, and to predict whether and to what extent the security performs financially like debt or equity. This financial analysis is overlayed by a refined technical legal appraisal of whether the security contains the essential legal ???Badges of Equity.??? The resulting form and substance approach provides a fair and equitable control mechanism for perceived tax arbitrage, whilst facilitating efficient financial contract innovation.  The ultimate source of non-linearity in the taxation of investment capital is the differential tax benefits provided to equity and debt. To promote tax linearity the differentiation needs to be removed, and the thesis makes recommendations for systemic reform, particularly concerning the introduction of a system of ???Franked Debt.??? The proposed system of ???Franked Debt??? would align the tax treatment of debt and equity by replacing the corporate interest deduction tax benefit with a lender credit in respect of corporate tax paid. This credit would operate mechanically like the existing shareholder imputation credit. The interface of this domestic tax credit scheme with the taxation of International investment capital, and the problems occasioned by constructive delivery of franking credits to Australian taxpayers via synthetics, are resolved by the design and costings of the new system, which has the potential to be revenue positive.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Derivative securities  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Dividends  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Stocks  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Investments  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Corporations  Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="subject">Taxation  Law and legislation  Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17591</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What attributions do teachers ascribe to student academic achievement?</field><field name="creator">Thomas, David Anthony, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study seeks to provide empirical evidence regarding teacher attributions of achievement for gifted students and those students not considered gifted. An examination is made of the extent to which teachers hold an entity or incremental theory of intelligence. It is also considered that the entity view of intelligence may be varied to come into line with the incremental approach. Concurrently, teacher attributions are examined to determine if there is a relationship between attributions for achievement and the gender of the student and teacher, the length of teaching experience, and the major subject area taught. The teachers?? attributions of achievement in four separate disciplines (English, Mathematics, Science and HSIE) are examined to determine if a difference exists amongst teachers in these four disciplines with reference to the attribution of achievement. This study investigates the possibility that teachers?? concern for their own self-interest to some extent influences their attributions of student achievement. The respondents are more than 200 high school teachers in the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), New South Wales Chapter, who completed three questionnaires, each comprising 20 questions. Questionnaire 1 sought to discover high school teachers?? general views of intelligence, while Questionnaires 2 and 3 considered the attributions made by teachers for student academic achievement (among the gifted and those not identified as gifted respectively). This study finds that teachers are more likely to see effort as the major indicator of student academic achievement. As well, teachers attribute male student success to ability and failure to lack of effort, and female student success to effort and failure to a lack of ability. Female teachers are more likely to consider that student achievement is more due to effort than are the male teachers and it is found that teachers across the four major subject areas are more likely to hold an incremental view of intelligence and will thus focus upon a learning approach to education rather than to a performance approach. The findings of this study provide a greater understanding of the attributional influences that affect the achievement levels of gifted students and students not considered gifted, and may have significant implications for educational practices in schools.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42783</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chris Marker:  A stylistic analysis of his film and media work</field><field name="creator">Broad, Lynne, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the poetics of editing in the films and multimedia works of Chris Marker.  From his first essay films of the 1950s to his 1998 CD-ROM Immemory, the director&#146;s work has attracted critical attention for its beauty and originality of expression.  Much existing analysis engages with this work in terms of its subject matter and themes and their relationship with its associational, rather than linear, narrative form, with relatively little focus on the stylistics of Marker&#146;s editing.  While questions of the director&#146;s thematic concerns also arise in my study, I argue that Marker&#146;s contribution to cinema and the visual arts cannot be fully appreciated without a systematic understanding of his stylistics&#151;his expressive use of cinematic forms and patterns.  In developing such an understanding, this thesis utilises the work of a number of film writers explicitly concerned with the expressive use of cinematic space and time.  From Andr?? Bazin, I take the idea of rapprochement to mean the way the comparison between two juxtaposed events or images suggests or expresses the meaning of their juxtaposition.  From Jean-Andr?? Fieschi, I draw on the idea that the dialectical interaction of the plastic, formal and narrative elements of a film gives meaning to its cinematic space and time.  My approach synthesises and builds upon both ideas for its account of the stylistics of Marker&#146;s work.   Starting with a preliminary analysis of one cinematic comparison in The Case of the Grinning Cat (2004), I then consider Marker&#146;s exploration of the imaginative potential of a single image sequence in The Last Bolshevik (1993).  After this, I explore examples of the stylistic figure of rapprochement in Letter from Siberia (1958), and the stylistic figure of transformation in Sunless (1982).  The thesis then studies articulations of rapprochement and transformation in the museum installations Zapping Zone: Proposals for an Imaginary Television (1991), Silent Movie (1995) and the CD-ROM Immemory.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stylistic analysis</field><field name="subject">Chris Marker</field><field name="subject">Essay film</field><field name="subject">Media work</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The great houses of Kolkata  1750- 2006</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Joanne Lea, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">British colonial rule in India provided opportunities for certain indigenous groups to profit in both wealth and status. With the rise of the East India Company in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) during the eighteenth century, the mainly Hindu merchant class embraced British rule in many ways, a significant and lasting one is the architecture of their residential mansions and palaces, known as the Great Houses. This study traces the architectural history of these buildings through the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries and examines the style that developed as a consequence.  The main objectives of the thesis are to demonstrate that:  1.	The architecture and style of the Great Houses of Kolkata&#146;s indigenous elites were inspired by their colonial experience. 2.	Despite the British architectural models available during the colonial period, the Great Houses feature hybrid designs and eclectic architectural forms. The thesis examines the meaning behind this anomaly. 3.	The Great Houses embody a particular time and place in the history of Kolkata and are unique. They are part of Kolkata&#146;s heritage. 4.	In spite of the influence of British colonial rule, traditional Hindu ways of life continued unabated in the private domains of the Great Houses. 5.	Their rise and decline parallels the socio-economic and political history of Kolkata.   The thesis approaches the complex reasons behind the transition and decline of the Great Houses by examining the history and architecture of these buildings in a chronologically linear order, beginning in 1757 with the Battle of Plassey, the political changes of the nineteenth century, and the subsequent relative decline of the importance of Bengal in the twentieth century to focus on the relevance of the Great Houses in the twenty first century.  The research has been undertaken on a number of levels. Primary and secondary sources have been used, both colonial and post Independence, in India and Australia. These methods have been supplemented by archival material including drawings of plans, by interviews with descendents of the Great Families, historians and architects in Kolkata and by an extensive photographic documentation of the houses as they are today.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">India</field><field name="subject">Architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42691</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of low-cost systems for safe drinking water in areas of Bangladesh and India affected by arsenic</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Ahmedul, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Safe water options for five arsenic-affected villages (Sarupie, Manikganj; Daniapara, Shirajdekhan; Babutepara, Muradnagar; Iruaien, Laksham; Rahulllabad, Nabinagar) in central Bangladesh were studied in order to assist the local people and to obtain an indication of general solutions to the arsenic problem that is currently affecting ~100 million people on the Indian subcontinent. Arsenic concentrations were measured in all drinking waters believed to be safe and in a random sample of "red" (unsafe) tubewell waters. Depending on geography, history of safe water sources and availability of pond/river, the options of dugwells, deep tubewells and sand filters were recommended for core village areas, combined with sustainable output testing and a distribution system to maximise the benefits of sustainable water output. Very shallow tubewells were recommended for testing in villages where dugwells were successful. Rainwater harvesting was not recommended, due to expense, small storage capacity and summer dry periods. Two dugwells of optimised design were constructed in Iruaien and Daniapara, each serving 50-100 families. The knowledge gained in the villages was incorporated into the first draft of a "Safe Water Book" for dissemination of honest and accurate information about solutions to the arsenic problem.  An air/iron treatment system was developed for removal of arsenic from tubewell water in locations where water treatment is the only option available. The system is based on the Bangladeshi "three kalshi" method, but optimised for efficient contact of water with air and iron. It can be constructed like a sand filter, and requires no chemical input, except for clean scrap iron. Spent scrap iron containing arsenic can be incorporated into concrete for safe disposal. A model air/iron system was constructed and run for two years to demonstrate the long-term viability of the device.  A colorimetric method, using silver diethyldithiocarbamate, was developed for determination of arsenic in the villages of Bangladesh. The equipment was adapted for rugged field use, and performed successfully without electricity or running water in improvised laboratory space in villages, providing linear calibrations 0-500 ??g/L and a 2&#963;  limit of detection of 5 ??g/L.  The appropriate technologies that should be developed or optimised for the arsenic affected region are described and preliminary suggestions are given about means by which self-propagating solutions might be developed in villages to solve the arsenic problem.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of precise microbiological reference materials</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Charlotte Ann, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Quality Control (QC) reference materials are widely used in microbiology to demonstrate the efficacy of testing methods and culture media.  The current method for preparation of QC materials is by serial dilution of a microbial broth culture to obtain a suspension that contains an estimated number of colony forming units (cfu).  Commercial reference material products are available with dried microbial cells, however, the numbers of cells are variable between batches as the production processes are reliant on cell suspensions of estimated cell number.  This study developed a method to produce precise microbial reference materials with a accurate number of viable cells.  Flow cytometry was used to count and dispense precise numbers of cells into a single droplet of fluid.  The droplets were then mixed with a lyoprotectant solution and subjected to freeze-drying.  The resultant freeze-dried pellets showed consistent average cfu counts between 28-33 cfu with a standard deviation &lt; 3 cfu.  The freeze-drying methodology and developed conditions of cell growth enabled &gt; 90% of the cells to survive freeze-drying and remain viable for one year at a storage temperature below -18??C.  The methodology for the production of freeze-dried pellet was applied to a range of genera including, different E. coli strains, Gram positive bacteria such as Listeria and Staphylococcus, the yeast Candida albicans and a spore-producing Bacillus cereus.  The precision of cell numbers was comparable between different microbial genera and strains and a consistent standard deviation below 3 cfu was achieved.  The same freeze-dried pellet method was used for the different micro-organisms, except for changes to preparation of cell suspensions.  Different methods of broth culture were developed to ensure freeze-dried cell survival.  A measurement of method reproducibility was obtained when 99 batches of pellets were produced, and within batch and between batch variation was determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Freeze drying.</field><field name="subject">Flow cytometry.</field><field name="subject">Precision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41848</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinforcement learning by incremental patching</field><field name="creator">Kim, Min Sub, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how an autonomous reinforcement learning agent can improve on an approximate solution by augmenting it with a small patch, which overrides the approximate solution at certain states of the problem. In reinforcement learning, many approximate solutions are smaller and easier to produce than ???flat??? solutions that maintain distinct parameters for each fully enumerated state, but the best solution within the constraints of the approximation may fall well short of global optimality. This thesis proposes that the remaining gap to global optimality can be efficiently minimised by learning a small patch over the approximate solution.  In order to improve the agent???s behaviour, algorithms are presented for learning the overriding patch. The patch is grown around particular regions of the problem where the approximate solution is found to be deficient. Two heuristic strategies are proposed for concentrating resources to those areas where inaccuracies in the approximate solution are most costly, drawing a compromise between solution quality and storage requirements. Patching also handles problems with continuous state variables, by two alternative methods: Kuhn triangulation over a fixed discretisation and nearest neighbour interpolation with a variable discretisation.  As well as improving the agent???s behaviour, patching is also applied to the agent???s model of the environment. Inaccuracies in the agent???s model of the world are detected by statistical testing, using a selective sampling strategy to limit storage requirements for collecting data.  The patching algorithms are demonstrated in several problem domains, illustrating the effectiveness of patching under a wide range of conditions. A scenario drawn from a real-time strategy game demonstrates the ability of patching to handle large complex tasks.  These contributions combine to form a general framework for patching over approximate solutions in reinforcement learning. Complex problems cannot be solved by brute force alone, and some form of approximation is necessary to handle large problems. However, this does not mean that the limitations of approximate solutions must be accepted without question. Patching demonstrates one way in which an agent can leverage approximation techniques without losing the ability to handle fine yet important details.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reinforcement learning.</field><field name="subject">Markov decision processes.</field><field name="subject">Patchwork.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39716</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The incidence of and risk factors for contact lens related microbial keratitis in Australia and New Zealand</field><field name="creator">Edwards, Catherine Patrice, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microbial keratitis is the most serious, and only potentially blinding complication of contact lens wear. To further understand and reduce the risk of this disease, incidence rates and risk factors have been estimated in numerous studies.  Since these studies were conducted, new lens types have been introduced designed to reduce the risk of infection. It was hypothesised that the issues of contact lens related hypoxia and poor lens hygiene could be addressed by the introduction of silicone hydrogel and daily disposable lenses respectively. This thesis describes the incidence of and risk factors for contact lens related microbial keratitis in Australia and New Zealand.  The incidence of infection was determined by capturing all cases of contact lens related presumed microbial keratitis in a 12-month surveillance study, and by estimating the number of lens wearers using a population-based phone survey. Characteristics of the cases and controls were compared to estimate risk factors. In Australia, rates of infection with daily and overnight wear of hydrogel lenses were similar to previously published reports (1.9 [95%CI]:1.8-2.0] and 19.5 [95%CI:14.6-29.5] per 10,000 wearers respectively). Compared to the incidence of infection with hydrogel lenses, silicone hydrogel lenses had a higher rate in daily wear (11.9 [95%CI: 10.0-14.6]), and a similar rate in extended wear (19.5 [95%CI:14.6-29.5]). Daily disposable lenses had a similar rate of infection to daily wear of hydrogel lenses (2.0 [95%CI:1.7-2.4]), but appeared to reduce the incidence of severe or vision loss keratitis (0.5 [95%CI: 0.5-0.6] and 0.0 [95%CI: 0.0-0.0] respectively).  Conducting the study in New Zealand confirmed the increase in incidence for overnight use of lenses, irrespective of lens type.  Comparison of the incidence rates in New Zealand and Australia show that the rates in the two countries are comparable, bar an unexplained lower rate of infection for extended wear of soft hydrogel lenses in New Zealand. Risk factors for infection were overnight use of lenses, from occasional overnight to extended wear use, poor lens case hygiene, smoking, high socio-economic status and less than 6 months experience in current lens type. Amongst daily wearers, Internet or mail order purchasing of lenses was also associated with a higher risk of infection. This study is unique in terms of the study design and sample size, and the wide scope of risk factors considered. The determination of these incidence rates of infection and identification of risk factors is of extreme value to lens wearers and lens care practitioners around the world, particularly as the strongest and most prevalent risk factors are modifiable.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">microbial keratitis</field><field name="subject">contact lenses</field><field name="subject">incidence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neo-normativity, the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, and latrinalia: The demonstration of a concept on non-heterosexual performativities</field><field name="creator">Liu, Edgar Yue Lap, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis uses the theory of abjection to understand differentiations in non-heterosexual identity performances in two distinct spaces - the 2005 Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras (SGLMG) parade and its associated press coverage, and latrinalia (graffiti found inside public toilets). At the same time, this thesis also presents evidence for a new concept of neo-normativity, where the stereotypical is normalised, both internally and externally, and actively reproduced. Neo-normativity, in turn, succeeds in explaining the many abjected relationships that between non-heterosexual communities and the stereotypical and quintessentialised performances. At the 2005 SGLMG parade such quintessentialised (or neo-normalised) performances were treated with both contempt - for being stereotypical and narrowly representative of the very diversity of non-heterosexual communities - as well as a tool for attracting commercial sponsorships which have growingly become an integral part to the continued survival of the annual parade. On a different level, another expression of abject was also revealed when these neo-normalised performances are persistently criticised by academics, news reporting and official photography for being stereotypical and non-representative which in itself are both a recognition as well as an ejection of the non-normative aspects of non-heterosexualities. Such an expression of abject was also evident in latrinalia found in several public toilet facilities throughout Greater Sydney were the interplay of desire and ejection were played out in a more covert manner, all the while highlighting the marginality of non-heterosexualities in these presumably heteronormative spaces. This application of abject theory emphasises neo-normative performances as permanently peripheral, a marginality of which makes these performances (and identities) intrinsically Queer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Latrinalia</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Mardi Gras</field><field name="subject">Abjection</field><field name="subject">Queer</field><field name="subject">performativity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43377</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutual fund investment bias around the world</field><field name="creator">Tian, Shu, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of three stand-alone but interrelated empirical studies investigating various aspects of the well-documented ??home bias anomaly?? in international investment. The findings help to understand the international investment allocation behaviour of mutual funds as well as their implications for asset pricing and mutual fund evaluation.  The first study investigates the roles of various firm attributes that encapsulate the deadweight costs in determining firm level investment bias. The main findings suggest that firm characteristics related to transaction costs, corporate governance and information asymmetry create significant barriers for fund managers. In addition, foreign funds are more constrained than domestic funds by information asymmetry, even in developed and liberalized markets. Moreover, this study stylises the international investment allocation model in Cooper and Kaplanis (1986) with a quadratic cost function, which reveals the marginal influence of market level deadweight costs on the relationship between firm characteristics and investment bias. It is found that when market level cross-border barriers are exacerbated, as in the case of emerging and restricted financial markets, foreign fund managers become more sensitive to market level deadweight costs and ignore firm characteristics. In general, these findings imply that the market level ??home bias anomaly?? is an outcome of the complementary effects of investment barriers at both firm and market levels. The second study examines the role of firm level investment bias in predicting future stock returns. It is found that both firm level foreign and domestic biases contain valuable information with respect to firm prospects. However, domestic bias is more informative than foreign bias in terms of subsequent stock returns, partially because of information asymmetry. The third study explores the determinants of fund level investment bias and its ability to predict fund performance. It is found that fund portfolio attributes determine fund level investment biases after controlling for market and fund investment objective specific effects, and fund level investment bias is positively related to fund performance due to lower deadweight costs. Moreover, good macroeconomic environments foster the development of the mutual fund industry.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information asymmetry</field><field name="subject">home bias</field><field name="subject">mutual fund</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Do managers look beyond cost when making outsourcing decisions? The role of innovation benefits and value appropriation</field><field name="creator">Perm-Ajchariyawong, Nidthida, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The question of whether outsourcing is a good or bad organizational practice has traditionally come down to whether the positive financial impact of outsourcing overcomes the potential organizational liabilities. The theoretical model proposed in this thesis argues that such thinking underestimates the positive organizational benefits that arise from outsourcing by giving inadequate consideration to impacts that outsourcing has on the innovation cycle of outsourcing providers.  This research adds to our understanding of outsourcing decision-making in three important ways. First, the thesis presents how innovation benefits can arise from outsourcing and proposes four potential innovation benefits from outsourcing &#150; the motivation for creativity, innovation scale, innovation scope and complementarity of capability. The central hypotheses argue that these beneficial factors should increase the likelihood of a decision to outsource an activity. Second, this research extends our understanding of outsourcing by examining the moderating effect of value appropriation on the decision to outsource. Third, the thesis provides a rigorous empirical utility theoretical approach &#150; best-worst scaling and discrete choice modeling &#150; to understanding managerial preferences and the components of outsourcing decision making.  The findings reveal that a significant segment of managers do indeed look beyond cost in choosing to outsource, focusing instead to concentrate broadly on a supplier&#146;s commitment to innovation, complementarity of capabilities and the ability of an outsourcing contract to appropriate value created in a relationship. This implies that the managerial application of outsourcing is not restricted to a short-term solution for cost savings, but can potentially be thought of, and used as, a strategic mechanism to drive innovation in organizations. Some benefits may not be immediately obvious (e.g., a supplier&#146;s motivation for innovation) and require more awareness from managers. Together, the theory and empirics provide insight into outsourcing decision-making and the opportunities for extending outsourcing as a strategic mechanism to drive innovation more broadly.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Value appropriation</field><field name="subject">Strategic outsourcing</field><field name="subject">Innovation</field><field name="subject">Choice experiment</field><field name="subject">Managerial decision-making</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42116</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical study of children's musical experiences in Italy, South Africa and Bali, discussing the nature of the transmission of musical knowledge</field><field name="creator">De Francesco, Luca, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The central interest of this thesis is the nature of the transmission of musical knowledge, and its meaning and purpose to different societies and within different contemplations of life and beliefs. In my case, I will specifically refer to what I learnt from the fieldwork I carried out in Southern Italy (2004), in some South African contexts (2005), and in the village of Batuan (Bali, Indonesia; 2006, 2007). All such experiences will be put, so to say, in a 'dialogue' with each other in order to suggest a few considerations.  The methodological tools employed to sustain my argument are Clifford Geertz's concept of thick description, and the audio-visual material collected throughout my fieldwork, which will further support my commentary. Using Clifford Geertz's approach, I suggest that in exploring the relationship between human beings and the various practices of 'music' existing, as well as their contents and aims, we need to look at music not as an isolated element on its own, as mostly conceived of in the West, but rather as an integral aspect of life itself. The facts and observations reported from my fieldwork show that what in the West is called music and music education can elsewhere be experienced and thought of in very dissimilar ways. In the village of Batuan, for example, music is not a special event, but an ingredient of the local community's life and its spirituality.  The final ruminations will speculate on the fact that in the West the fragmentation through which life is understood, and that has destroyed the bond between life and the arts, is also reflected in the educational system. In modern Western societies, the detachment of arts from life has created a craving and a need for artistic exclusivity, which celebrates the individualistic rather than the communal, and aesthetics rather than spirituality, unlike Bali, for example. As a starting point, we are asked to ponder whether, and how, in the West we can still entertain the hope to reconcile such a fragmentation with a more holistic approach, where music becomes equal to the other daily activities taking place within our community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fieldwork in Italy, South Africa and Bali</field><field name="subject">Musical knowledge</field><field name="subject">Children and music</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unnatural production of natural products: Heterologous expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of cyanobacterial-derived compounds</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Alexandra Anne, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cyanobacteria produce a myriad of structurally unique secondary metabolites with useful bioactive properties. Heterologous expression of a variety of microbial natural compounds has been used to harness their diversity and facilitate their combinatorial biosynthesis. However, these genetic techniques have not been developed for secondary metabolite-producing cyanobacteria. Therefore the genetically manipulable Escherichia coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered in order to develop effective heterologous hosts and promoters for the expression of cyanobacterial-derived compounds. The phosphopanthetheinyl transferase (PPT), Sppt, from Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 was characterised to determine its ability to activate carrier proteins from secondary metabolite pathways. Despite in silico evidence which suggested Sppt was able to activate a wide range of carrier proteins, biochemical analysis revealed that it is dedicated for fatty acid synthesis. Consequently, E. coli and Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 were engineered to encode a broad-range PPT, from the filamentous cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena NSOR10, for the activation of carrier proteins from nonribosomal peptide synthesis. Cyanobacterial natural product engineering was also explored with the characterisation of two relaxed specificity adenylation domains (A-domains) from the biosynthetic pathway of the toxin microcystin. The wide variety of microcystin compounds produced by cyanobacterial species suggests that multiple amino acids can be activated by the same A-domain. This was supported by preliminary ATP-[32P]PPi exchange assays and was subsequently harnessed in the production of a variety of dipeptides using two reconstituted modules in vitro. Transposition was investigated as a potential mechanism for the transfer of nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene clusters to heterologous hosts. This was performed via the characterisation of the putative transposase, Mat, physically linked with the microcystin synthetase gene cluster (mcyS). PCR screening, in silico analysis and nitrocellulose filter binding assays indicated that this transposase may have mediated mcyS gene cluster rearrangements but not entire gene cluster mobilisation between species. The potential role of transposases in the natural combinatorial biosynthesis of microcystin has evolutionary implications for the dynamic nature of cyanobacterial genomes and applications for use in the engineering of novel bioactive compounds. Therefore, the results from this study may provide a biotechnological platform for the transfer, expression and combinatorial biosynthesis of novel cyanobacterial-derived natural products.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phosphopantetheinyl transferase</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">Transposase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of hypnotic reading disruptions</field><field name="creator">Hung, Lynette Faye, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated hypnotic reading disruptions to identify parameters of hypnosis that may influence reading and to inform the broader issue of whether hypnotic suggestions impact phenomenal experience versus perceptual-cognitive processing.  Chapter 1 reviews the relevant literature and identifies core issues addressed by this program.  Chapter 2 presents two experiments and two case studies, which focused on establishing a paradigm for investigating hypnotic reading disruptions; in particular, modulation of the Stroop effect.  Findings indicated that disruptions of reading experience and/or reading processing may be influenced by the complexity of the suggestion and the natural response strategies of individuals.  Chapter 3 presents two experiments that examined the influence of test time and test demands, and explored the experiential factors underlying response to different suggestions.  Findings indicated that both hypnotic and posthypnotic suggestions produced disruptions of reading experience but not reading processing.  Also, individuals?? experiences and cognitive strategies varied depending on the suggestion they received.  Chapter 4 presents two experiments that compared the impact of three suggestions on reading experience and reading processing.  Findings indicated that highs were more likely to achieve disruptions of reading experience in response to a suggestion compatible with their natural strategies.  Notably, some highs altered their reading processing and hypnotically modulated Stroop interference.  Other highs and lows modified their reading processing, but independent of hypnosis, hypnotisability and a suggestion.  Chapter 5 presents one experiment that examined the time course of hypnotic reading disruptions and the influence of test context.  Findings indicated that highs could maintain disruptions of reading experience over time.  They also modified their reading processing independent of hypnosis and a suggestion.  Chapter 6 presents one experiment that examined implicit perception, and the impact of hypnosis and hypnotisability.  Findings indicated that highs were influenced by information from reading processing despite their experiences of disrupted reading.  Chapter 7 interprets the findings of this program within a proposed model of hypnotic disruptions of reading and Stroop performance.  This model differentiates between the mechanisms that may underlie reading experiences, the mechanisms that may underlie reading processing and their interaction, and highlights the value of hypnotic models of cognitive processes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stroop</field><field name="subject">Hypnosis</field><field name="subject">Reading</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42613</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A telemedicine-based energy monitor for managing diabetes mellitus</field><field name="creator">Voon, Rudi, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin or in which the body has high insulin resistance thus making the regulation of blood glucose metabolism difficult. Currently, diabetes is still incurable. All patients need to well manage their blood glucose levels to reduce the risk of complications.  This dissertation is comprised of two major studies. In diabetes type I, the blood glucose can only be managed by multiple daily injection of insulin. However, most patients tend to have difficulty in deciding the right amount of insulin dose. The first study is the development of a mathematical model of blood glucose levels, which leads to the development of a decision support system for diabetes type I using the Markov theory.  In some type II and gestational diabetes, blood glucose can be managed by choosing diet properly and by exercising regularly. However, people tend to overestimate their activity levels. The second study describes the design and development of a wearable device based on the triaxial accelerometer that estimates the energy levels of normal daily physical activity with comparable accuracy to the gas analysis.  This device development leads to two clinical studies. The first clinical study investigates whether the energy monitor could help people with diabetes in promoting and managing their daily activity and help to improve the glycosylated haemoglobin and body mass index. The second clinical study investigates whether the energy monitor could help pregnant women with gestational diabetes in managing their daily activity, blood glucose levels and body weight gain.  This thesis also develops a telemedicine system to automate the data collection during the clinical trial period. The system would securely transmit all diabetes and energy data from the participants' home to a remote server.  A key finding of this study was that a higher activity score results in smaller fluctuations in blood glucose levels between measurements in both diabetes and gestational diabetes subjects. This suggests that higher activity levels would make the management of diabetes more effective by reducing the fluctuation in blood glucose levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Energy expenditure</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="subject">Markov model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41328</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite dimensional representability of forward rate and LIBOR models</field><field name="creator">Corr, Anthony, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines finite dimensional representability of Forward Rate and LIBOR models. A new approach is examined. This approach is more general, elementary, and relevant to finance when compared with existing approaches. This new approach is applied to the following infinite dimensional equations used in finance: ?Gaussian Heath, Jarrow and Morton model; ?Free 1 Heath, Jarrow and Morton model; ?Brace, G?atarek and Musiela???s LIBOR model.

The causal role of Human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer has been firmly established. However, there have been only a few studies of HPV infection of the cervix in Vietnam, and in cervical cancer in particular. This project was conducted to investigate infectious and genetic factors that may be involved in cervical cancer in Vietnam. The study comprises two parts: the first part examines the relationship between HPV and Chlamydia trachomatis infections and cervical cancer, and the second part focuses on the impact of HPV infection on microRNA expression. The aims of the first part were to assess prevalence of HPV and its subtypes, C.trachomatis infection and their relationship in cancer of the cervix. The investigation was performed on two populations: Vietnamese (cancer and non-cancer groups), Australian (normal cytology and abnormal cytology groups). The results reveal that (i) both HPV, especially high ?? risk types, and C.trachomatis are significantly more prevalent in cervical cancer and in cytologically abnormal cervix; (ii) C.trachomatis is a cofactor with HPV and is associated with high-risk HPV types in cervical cancer; (iii) 75% non-cancer women in this Vietnam cohort were infected with high-risk HPVs; (iv) Most of HPV-16 positive Vietnamese samples harbor E6 East-Asia variant whose oncogenicity is potentially greater than the prototype (Europe variant). Together these findings explain in part high rate of cancer of the cervix in Vietnam. The main aim of the second part was to investigate miRNA expression in HPV-16 E6/E7 transfected keratinocytes, in HeLa, SiHa, and C33A cell lines in order to ascertain whether or not HPV and different HPV types affect cellular miRNA expression. These experiments revealed overexpression of some miRNA oncogenes in E6/E7 containing keratinocytes together with underexpression of some miRNA tumor suppressors in (HPV positive) HeLa and SiHa compared with (HPV negative) C33A suggesting that regulation of miRNA expression is an addtional pathway for HPV-induced carcinogenesis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies on beta 2 glycoprotein I and antiphospholipid antibodies</field><field name="creator">Rahgozar, Soheila, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Beta 2 glycoprotein I (&#946;2GPI) is a major antigenic target in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS).

The possible interaction of &#946;2GPI with thrombin is investigated using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays and surface plasmon resonance based studies.

I argue that rethinking community directly entails a rethinking of temporality. This is initially suggested in my examination of the work of anthropologists Carol Greenhouse and Johannes Fabian, who argue that conceptions of time play an important role in social methods of ??managing?? difference. I then turn to an analysis of a number of different feminist accounts of community in order to show that, in each case, the attempt to rethink community in terms of an openness to diversity is invariably accompanied by a contestation of dominant linear temporal concepts. I suggest that these accounts represent a shift to an understanding of time as fractured, dislocated or out of joint. While this shift is explicit in some of the work I examine, specifically in Linnell Secomb and Rosalyn Diprose??s work, for the most part, the problem of temporality is not explicitly thematised. I therefore seek to uncover an emerging critique of linear temporality within feminist accounts of community, while also arguing for a greater recognition of the way time systems shape the way we understand and relate to difference. In order to extend the contestation of linear temporality developed in the first section, I turn to the work of Jacques Derrida. I extend the gesture towards a dislocated time by examining Derrida??s deconstruction of Aristotle??s account of time and his quasi-concept, diff??rance. Both of these accounts challenge the self-presence of the now. What proves to be particularly important for the problem of community is the way this fundamental dislocation suggests a reworking of social understandings of the heritage, transformation and political action. This suggestion is developed through an analysis of two of Derrida??s later essays ??The Other Heading?? and ??Psyche: Inventions of the other??, where I draw out his claim that an openness to the coming of the other involves both the active disruption of convention and tradition as well as a passive relation to an open and incalculable future. I conclude this thesis by arguing that Derrida??s account of time, as a disruptive exposure to alterity, is a provocative candidate for a model of temporality congenial to feminist projects of reconceptualising community. Accordingly, this thesis makes a unique contribution to feminist theory by connecting two significant but often separate concerns, in the process providing new avenues for feminist theorisations of community.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Derrida</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="subject">Feminist theory</field><field name="subject">Temporality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41489</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and application of an evaluation framework for injury surveillance systems</field><field name="creator">Mitchell, Rebecca Jane, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Information from injury data collections is widely used to formulate injury policy, evaluate injury prevention initiatives and to allocate resources to areas deemed a high priority.  Obtaining quality data from injury surveillance is essential to ensure the appropriateness of these activities.  This thesis seeks to develop a framework to assess the capacity of an injury data collection to perform injury surveillance and to use this framework to assess the capacity of both injury mortality and morbidity data collections in New South Wales (NSW) Australia to perform work-related or motor vehicle crash (MVC)-related injury surveillance.  An Evaluation Framework for Injury Surveillance Systems (EFISS) was developed through a multi-staged process, using information from the literature to identify surveillance system characteristics, SMART criteria to assess the suitability of these characteristics to evaluate an injury data collection, and by obtaining feedback on the characteristics from a panel of surveillance experts using a two round modified Delphi study.  At the conclusion of development, there were 18 characteristics, consisting of 5 data quality, 9 operational, and 4 practical characteristics, that were identified as important for inclusion within an EFISS.  In addition, a rating system was created for the EFISS characteristics, based on available evidence and reasonable opinion.  The evaluation of six injury data collections using the EFISS for their capacity to perform either work- or MVC-related injury surveillance illustrated the inability of any of the data collections to enumerate all cases of either work- or MVC-related injury mortality or morbidity in NSW or to capture all of the data considered necessary for work- or MVC-related injury surveillance.  This evaluation has identified areas for improvement in all data collections and has demonstrated that for both work- and MVC-related injury surveillance that multiple collections should be reviewed to inform both work- and MVC-related policy development and injury prevention priority setting in NSW.  The development of an EFISS has built upon existing evaluation guidelines for surveillance systems and provides an important step towards the creation of a framework specifically tailored to evaluate an injury data collection.  Information obtained through an evaluation conducted using an EFISS would be useful for agencies responsible for injury data collections to identify where these collections could be improved to increase their usefulness for injury surveillance, and ultimately, for injury prevention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">framework</field><field name="subject">injury surveillance</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generalisations of the fundamental theorem of projective geometry</field><field name="creator">McCallum, Rupert Gordon, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The fundamental theorem of projective geometry states that a mapping from a projective space to itself whose range has a sufficient number of points in general position is a projective transformation possibly combined with a self-homomorphism of the underlying field.

A systematic evaluation of the GC x GC/TOFMS configuration for high-speed applications has received little attention in the literature. The feasibility of High Speed Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography coupled to Mass Spectrometry (High speed GC x GC/MS) for complex mixtures has been investigated in this thesis. A particular focus was placed on comparing conventional scanning quadrupole mass spectrometry (qMS) with a newly available non-scanning time-of-flight instruments (TOFMS). Experiments were carried out using GC/qMS, GC x GC/qMS, GC/TOFMS and GC x GC/TOFMS both in normal (slow) and fast temperature rates coupled with high frequency modulation in GC x GC. Initially a complex mixture consists of 24 semivolatile compounds was used as the analyte for the above purpose. In the initial experiments parameters like acquisition rate and duty cycle for qMS were determined to evaluate the effectiveness of the instrument for fast analysis. The practical duty cycle value obtained for the qMS was only about 18 % for single ion and one compound at a dwell time of 10 ms in SIM mode. In both high-speed GC/qMS and high-speed GC x GC/qMS techniques only about 40 % of the components in the complex mixture were found to be well separated. The acquisition rate of scanning instruments like qMS is incompatible for fast eluting peaks in high speed GC. TOFMS that has an acquisition rate of several hundred spectra per second offer the potential to define the fast GC peaks accurately. The high quality spectra from TOFMS also enable deconvolution of coeluting peaks in the complex mixtures. The advantage of the automated spectral deconvolution is demonstrated for the identification of the coeluting peaks in the complex mixtures. Coelution of peaks is also observed with highspeed GC/TOFMS technique. The high-speed GC x GC/TOFMS was also tested with two different analyte system ??? A pesticide mixture and platformate (an aromatic mixture) to evaluate the suitability for high-speed analysis of complex mixtures. A poor resolution was observed for the pesticide mixture in the two-dimensional plane and it appeared, as there was nearly no orthogonal separation in the second dimension. The platformate mixture displayed a better two-dimensional separation. Chromatographic peak resolution is not really a primary requirement for locating and identifying the coeluting compounds in high-speed GC x GC/TOFMS technique. However, it was observed that the high-speed GC x GC/TOFMS too faced problem to unscramble the mass spectra of those compounds with similar structure and sharing the same unique masses.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">quadrupole mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography,</field><field name="subject">Time of-flight Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="subject">duty cycle</field><field name="subject">dwell time</field><field name="subject">acquisition rate</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining the role of &#946;-tubulin isotypes in drug resistance and tumourigenesis in lung cancer cells</field><field name="creator">Gan, Pei Pei, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and in its advanced stage, has a poor clinical outcome. Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, either intrinsic or acquired, is the primary cause of treatment failure in NSCLC. Tubulin binding agents (TBAs), such as paclitaxel and vinorelbine are important components in the treatment of NSCLC. Upregulation of the neuronal specific class III &#946;-tubulin (&#946;-III-tubulin) is frequently found in drug resistant cancer cell lines and human tumours, lending support that &#946;III-tubulin might play a role in the development of drug resistance in cancer cells. However, to date, compelling evidence supporting its direct role in drug resistance and response has been lacking.  To address its role in NSCLC, RNA interference (RNAi) was employed to knock down &#946;III-tubulin expression in two drug naive NSCLC cell lines, Calu-6 and H460. Specific knockdown of &#946;III-tubulin resulted in increased sensitivity to TBAs and DNA damaging agents, two classes of agents that are commonly used in the treatment of NSCLC. Increased sensitivity to TBAs and DNA damaging agents in the &#946;III-tubulin knockdown cells was due to an increased propensity of the cells to undergo apoptosis, suggesting that this tubulin isotype may be a cellular survival factor. Interestingly, specific knockdown of &#946;II- or &#946;IVb-tubulin hypersensitised the cells to Vinca alkaloids but not taxanes, demonstrating that each isotype is unique in terms of drug-target interactions. Moreover, the &#946;-tubulin isotype composition of a cell can influence response, and therefore resistance to TBAs.  To determine whether &#946;III-tubulin differentially regulates microtubule behaviour and influences cell proliferation via an effect on microtubule dynamics, siRNAs were used to knockdown &#946;III-tubulin expression in H460 cells stably expressing GFP-&#946;I-tubulin and the dynamic instability behaviour of individual microtubules was measured by time-lapse microscopy. In the absence of drug, silencing of &#946;III tubulin alone did not significantly affect the dynamic instability of interphase microtubules. However, at the IC50 for proliferation of either paclitaxel or vincristine, the overall dynamicity was suppressed significantly in the &#946;III-tubulin silenced cells as compared to the control, indicating that &#946;III-tubulin knockdown induces paclitaxel or vincristine sensitivity by enhancing the ability of these agents to suppress microtubule dynamics. At a concentration of drug that represented the IC50 for mitotic arrest, for either paclitaxel or vincristine, increased apoptosis induction was found to play a dominant role in &#946;III-tubulin knockdown, further supporting a role for &#946;III-tubulin as a cellular survival factor. Collectively, when &#946;III-tubulin is overexpressed in tumours cells, it is highly likely to be promoting cellular survival and resistance to TBAs.  In addition to its proposed role in drug resistance, high expression of &#946;III-tubulin in tumours of non-neuronal origin such as NSCLC, has been positively correlated with the degree of tumour aggressiveness. H460 cells are known to display substrate- independent growth in soft agar and tumourigenicity in nude mice and provided an ideal model to investigate the role of &#946;III-tubulin in tumourigenesis. To address the role of &#946;III-tubulin, H460 cells stably expressing &#946;III-tubulin shRNA were generated, validated and examined using both in vitro and in vivo methods of tumourigenesis. Colony formation of H460 cells stably expressing &#946;III-tubulin shRNA was dramatically reduced in soft agar and significantly delayed tumour growth and reduced tumour incidence of subcutaneous xenografted tumours in nude mice when compared to respective controls. These results provide new insights into the function of &#946;III-tubulin and suggest that &#946;III-tubulin may play an important role in tumour development and progression in lung cancer.  In conclusion, &#946;-tubulin isotype status can serve as a valuable molecular marker capable of distinguishing patients with differential sensitivity to TBAs. These results not only shed new light on the role of specific &#946;-tubulin isotypes in the response to TBAs, but also the role of &#946;III-tubulin in the biology of cancer that will lead to new treatment strategies for NSCLC.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumourigenesis.</field><field name="subject">&#946;-tubulin.</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust Control For Gantry Cranes</field><field name="creator">Costa, Giuseppe, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis a class of robust non-linear controllers for a gantry crane system are discussed. The gantry crane has three degrees of freedom, all of which are interrelated. These are the horizontal traverse of the cart, the vertical motion of the goods (i.e. rope length) and the swing angle made by the goods during the movement of the cart. The objective is to control all three degrees of freedom. This means achieving setpoint  control for the cart and the rope length and cancellation of the swing oscillations. A mathematical model of the gantry crane system is developed using Lagrangian dynamics. In this thesis it is shown that a model of the gantry crane system can be represented as two sub models which are coupled by a term which includes the rope length as a parameter. The first system will consist of the cart and swing dynamics and the other system is the hoist dynamics. The mathematical model of these two systems will be derived independent of the other system. The model that is comprised of the two sub models is verified as an accurate model of a gantry crane system and it will be used to simulate the performance of the controllers using Matlab. For completeness a fully coupled mathematical model of the gantry crane system is also developed. A detailed design of a gain scheduled sliding mode controller is presented. This will guarantee the controller's robustness in the presence of uncertainties and bounded matched disturbances. This controller is developed to achieve cart setpoint and swing control while achieving rope length setpoint control. A non gain scheduled sliding mode controller is also developed to determine if the more complex gain scheduled sliding mode controller gives any significant improvement in performance. In the implementation of both sliding mode controllers, all system states must be available. In the real-time gantry crane system used in this thesis, the cart velocity and the swing angle velocity are not directly available from the system. They will be estimated using an alpha-beta state estimator. To overcome this limitation and provide a more practical solution an optimal output feedback model following controller is designed. It is demonstrated that by expressing the system and the model for which the system is to follow in a non-minimal state space representation, LQR techniques can be used to design the controller. This produces a dynamic controller that has a proper transfer function, and negates the need for the availability of all system states. This thesis presents an alternative method of solving the LQR problem by using a generic eigenvalue solution to solve the Riccati equation and thus determine the optimal feedback gains. In this thesis it is shown that by using a combination of sliding mode and H??? control techniques, a non-linear controller is achieved which is robust in the presence of a wide variety of uncertainties and disturbances. A supervisory controller is also described in this thesis. The supervisory control is made up of a feedforward and a feedback component. It is shown that the feedforward component is the crane operator's action, and the feedback component is a sliding mode controller which compensates as the system's output deviates from the desired trajectory because of the operator's inappropriate actions or external disturbances such as wind gusts and noise. All controllers are simulated using Matlab and implemented in real-time on a scale model of the gantry crane system using the program RTShell. The real-time results are compared against simulated results to determine the controller's performance in a real-time environment.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robust Control</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear Control</field><field name="subject">Sliding mode Control</field><field name="subject">Model Following Control</field><field name="subject">Gantry Crane Control</field><field name="subject">Non-linear Control</field><field name="subject">Gantry Cranes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective attention in human causal learning and recognition memory</field><field name="creator">Griffiths, Oren Dennis, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">It was hypothesized that similar selective attention processes might underlie two important empirical phenomena from traditionally distinct fields of cognitive psychology; the effect of divided attention on memory, and the blocking effect in associative learning. To investigate this hypothesis, ten experiments were conducted to investigate the role of selective attention in recognition and causal learning. In order to do so, a new category-based causal judgment task was constructed (Chapter 1), which allowed measurement of both causal strength and cue recognition. This procedure was then used to examine the blocking effect, in which pre-training with one cue, A, typically results in impaired learning about a second cue, B, when those two cues are trained in compound (AB+). Participants also demonstrated decreased recognition performance for the causally redundant cue B, suggesting that less attention had been paid to it in training (Chapter 3). Neither blocking in recognition, nor in causal judgment, was influenced by an additivity manipulation (Chapter 4). These results are consistent with the idea that attention is preferentially allocated towards the more predictive cue A, and away from the less predictive cue B (e.g., Mackintosh, 1975). Contrary to this hypothesis, poorer recognition was observed for predictive cues than for novel, or unreliable predictors (Chapter 5). Finally, in Chapter 6, a dissociation was observed between memory encoding and the rate at which causal learning occurred; participants learned more rapidly about previously predictive cues (e.g. A) than previously non-predictive cues (e.g. E), but demonstrated equivalently poor recognition for both types of cues (e.g. A and E). In Chapter 7, the present data are discussed in relation to models of associative learning, categorization and memory. A new model, based upon Mackintosh (1975) and Kruschke (1992) is proposed to account for the observed relationship between the extent to which each cue is attended to, learned about and later recognized.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Freedom to worship: frameworks for the realisation of religious minority rights</field><field name="creator">Ngui, Samantha, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A comparative study of the development of places of worship in Sydney was conducted primarily through the collection of data from development applications to construct or to use premises as a place of worship over a five year period from 2000-2005. The data indicated that a greater and disproportionately higher number of applications by religious minorities were rejected. The significance of the findings does not lie exclusively in identifying the likelihood of development applications gaining approval. The process of determining development applications and the impacts of the outcome of the process were also important. This is why the content of the objections raised to development applications was analysed. The underlying themes in the opposition to development applications related strongly to citizenship, particularly how the boundaries of local forms of citizenship are negotiated. In establishing places of worship religious groups seek to have their citizenship claims recognised. These citizenship claims include: the right to access, mark and use space (Dunn 2005), equality of citizenship with local residents and with other religious groups, and importantly, the right to freedom of worship. One of the main assertions made in this thesis is that by restricting access to sites that people can worship and by restricting the practice of religion, the right to freedom of worship is compromised. Churches dominate the religious landscape of Sydney. This dominance can be partially attributed to the significant levels of historical assistance from the state with the building of Churches. This included access to land, free labour, support for clergy and income support which assisted in the development of early Churches. The appropriateness of giving this type of assistance is not debated in this thesis. However, the assistance itself is significant for two main reasons. Firstly it is emblematic of the privileged relationship between the Church and the state in Australia, and secondly, it raises questions over the lack of privileges afforded to religious minorities. In responding to the question of whether secularism is likely to assist religious minorities, the establishment of places of worship demonstrates how pluralising the Church state link may be of greater utility to religious minorities than strict forms of secularism. The examination of this issue introduces the importance of an equal relationship between the state and religious groups to equality of citizenship for religious minorities. The extent to which multicultural citizenship can assist religious minorities in realising their right to freedom of worship was critically examined in this thesis. The adequacy of the institutional responses to religious diversity was assessed. This included an examination of local government, courts, the media, heritage programs and the planning profession. The planning process demonstrates how a supposedly neutral or colour-blind approach can generate uneven outcomes, which discriminate against religious minorities. The broader policy and legislative responses to religious diversity were examined in order to identify how deficiencies in the multicultural framework contributed to difficulties for religious minorities establishing places of worship.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Place of worship</field><field name="subject">Secularism</field><field name="subject">Religious minorities</field><field name="subject">Multicultural citizenship</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42969</field></doc><doc><field name="title">vNUMA: Virtual shared-memory multiprocessors</field><field name="creator">Chapman, Matthew, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Shared memory systems, such as SMP and ccNUMA topologies, simplify programming and administration.  On the other hand, systems without hardware support for shared memory, such as clusters of commodity workstations, are commonly used due to cost and flexibility considerations.  In this thesis, virtualisation is proposed as a technique that can bridge the gap between these architectures.  The resulting system, vNUMA, is a hypervisor with a unique feature: it provides the illusion of shared memory across separate nodes on a fast network.  This allows a cluster of workstations to be transformed into a single shared memory multiprocessor, supporting existing operating systems and applications.  Such an approach could also have applications for emerging highly-parallel architectures, allowing a shared memory programming model to be retained while reducing hardware complexity.  To build such a system, it is necessary to meld both a high-performance hypervisor and a high-performance distributed shared memory (DSM) system.  This thesis addresses the challenges inherent in both of these tasks.  First, designing an efficient hypervisor layer is considered; since vNUMA is implemented on the Itanium processor architecture, this is with particular reference to Itanium processor virtualisation.  Then, novel DSM protocols are developed that allow SMP consistency models to be reproduced while providing better performance than a simple atomically-consistent DSM system.  Finally, the system is evaluated, proving that it can provide good performance and compelling advantages for a variety of applications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DSM</field><field name="subject">virtualisation</field><field name="subject">hypervisor</field><field name="subject">ccNUMA</field><field name="subject">cluster</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the SiN Deposition and effect of the hydrogenation on solid-phase crystallisation of evaporated thin-film silicon solar cells on glass</field><field name="creator">Sakano, Tomokazu, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">One of the poly-Si thin-film cells developed at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is the EVA cell. In this work, SiN films for EVA cells as an antireflection/barrier coating were investigated. In addition, the effect of hydrogenation pre-treatment of solid phase crystallisation (SPC) on grain size and open-circuit voltage (Voc) was investigated. The SiN films deposited by PECVD were examined for uniformity of the thickness and the refractive index of the films across the position of the samples in the PECVD deposition system. A spectrophotometric analysis was used to determine these film properties. It was found that these properties were very uniform over the deposition area. Good repeatability of the depositions was also observed. A series of SiN film depositions by reactive sputtering were also performed to optimize the deposition process. Parameters adjusted during the deposition were nitrogen flow rate, substrate bias, and substrate temperature. By investigating the deposition rate, refractive index, and surface roughness of the films, the three deposition parameters were optimised. The effects of post SiN deposition treatments (a-Si deposition, SPC, RTA, and hydrogenation) on thickness and refractive index of both SiN films deposited by PECVD and reactive sputtering were investigated by using samples which have the same structure as the EVA cells. The thickness of the PECVD SiN films decreased about 6 % after all the treatments. On the other hand, the thickness reductions of the reactively sputtered SiN films were very small. The refractive index of the PECVD SiN films increased about 0.6 % after the treatments, whereas that of the reactively sputtered SiN films decreased 1.3 % after the treatments. As a possible method to improve the performance of EVA cells, hydrogenation of a-Si was investigated as a pre-treatment of SPC process. There were no obvious differences in the grainsize and the Voc of the EVA cells with and without the hydrogenation. Therefore it is likely that the hydrogenation pre-treatment of SPC does not have a beneficial effect on the performance of EVA cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrogenation</field><field name="subject">Thin-film solar cells</field><field name="subject">Poly-Si</field><field name="subject">Solid phase crystallisation</field><field name="subject">SiN</field><field name="subject">Silicon nitride</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42134</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis and characterization of titanium dioxide thin films</field><field name="creator">Gan, Wee Yong, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, titanium dioxide (TiO2)-based thin film photocatalysts of different morphologies were synthesized and studied for their photoelectrocatalytic and photocatalytic properties. The superhydrophilicity of selected TiO2 films were also assessed. The work started with the synthesis of nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films with minimal porosity. A photoelectrocatalytic study was performed to evaluate the films?? photocurrent response in the presence of various organic compounds. At low concentrations, the amount of photocurrent generated was found to be influenced by the molecular structure of the organic compounds. As the concentration increased, the photocurrent response became dependent on the level of interaction of the organic compounds and their partially degraded intermediates with the TiO2 surface. Highly dispersed platinum (Pt) were added onto TiO2 films by a photo-deposition method, and their photocatalytic and photoelectrocatalytic activities were assessed using a novel thin-layer photo(electrochemical)-catalytic system. The system allowed the photocurrent data that originated from the photoelectrocatalysis process to be collected in the reaction cell, and the amount of organic compound being oxidized to be quantified. The Pt deposits were found to enhance photocatalysis by increasing the photogenerated charge-carriers separation, but conversely they retarded the photoelectrocatalysis process. The next part of the work covered the development of mesoporous TiO2 films via the evaporative-induced self-assembly procedure. The structural characteristics of the films were altered by controlling the relative humidity and temperature during the coating and thermal treatment processes. The effect of key structural parameters, such as film porosity, surface area and crystallinity, on the photoelectrocatalytic activity was investigated. These parameters were found to affect the photoelectrocatalysis because the performance of a catalyst in the photoelectrocatalysis application relies strongly on attributes such as the photocatalyst particles?? interconnectivity and the contact to the conducting substrate. The last part of this thesis demonstrated the effort undertaken to improve the UV-induced superhydrophilic effect of a TiO2 film. A multilayer structure of TiO2 nanoparticles was assembled to create a novel TiO2 film that required no UV-activation to induce a uniform water sheeting across its surface. The novel TiO2 thin film exhibited stable superhydrophilic wetting and anti-fogging behaviors after repetitive cycles of heat and wetting treatment, and this performance was affected by the porosity and surface hydroxyl (-OH) contents.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Thin film</field><field name="subject">Photoelectrocatalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43310</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolutionary consequences of sexual conflict</field><field name="creator">Hall, Matthew, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The difference in evolutionary interests of males and females can select for traits that favour an individual??s fitness at the expense of their mate??s lifetime fitness. Despite the widespread occurrence of this sexual conflict over reproductive interactions, however, research to date has largely focused on the fitness costs imposed on females by manipulative males. Empirical evidence is particularly sparse for how mating can also be costly for males, the genetic structure of traits involved in reproductive interactions, and how sexual conflict can modify sexual selection in general. My aim was to explore the broader evolutionary consequence of sexual conflict and male-female interactions. In the nuptial-feeding Australian ground cricket, Pteronemobius sp., I used an experimental evolution approach to explore how diet and sexual conflict interact to determine the costs of mating.  In the Australian black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, I used molecular and quantitative genetic approaches to characterise the fitness consequences and genetic basis of spermatophore attachment, a trait at the centre of inter-locus sexual conflict, and then related this to both condition and male attractiveness. Finally, in T. commodus, I quantified how sexual conflict alters the sexual selection acting on male sexual traits and how this in turn shapes genetic architecture and the persistence of additive genetic variance. My results demonstrate the complex nature of reproductive interactions between males and females. Importantly, I show that diet can mediate the expression of sexual conflict in a mating system and shape the evolution of male life-span. I also show that reproductive interactions influence the fitness benefits that both male and females obtain from mating in ways that are not predicted by current theory and that much of the potential for such traits to co-evolve is via a common genetic association with condition. Finally, I demonstrate that sexual conflict can profoundly modify the process and outcome of sexual selection, thereby influencing how additive genetic variation is maintained in a suite of male sexual traits. These results highlight the need for a greater integration of sexual conflict and sexual selection theory as the evolutionary potential and significance of sexual conflict may currently be underestimated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quantitative Genetics</field><field name="subject">Sexual Conflict</field><field name="subject">Sexual Selection</field><field name="subject">Life-history Tradeoffs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41284</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of novel anticancer agents in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</field><field name="creator">Liaw, Tracy Yun En, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tubulin-binding agents (TBAs) are employed widely in cancer treatment, including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Despite their success, resistance to TBAs can be a major clinical problem. Mechanisms mediating resistance to TBAs that target the colchicine-binding site on &#946;-tubulin, along with novel therapeutic strategies were investigated. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a multi-targeted TBA active in various cancer types, yet its efficacy and mechanisms(s) of action in haematological malignancies are not well evaluated. To improve understanding of mechanisms(s) of action and drug resistance, leukaemia cells, CCRF-CEM, were selected for resistance to 2ME2. These resistant cells displayed reduced drug-induced mitotic arrest and increased tubulin polymer levels. Moreover, the resistant cells also acquired &#946;-tubulin mutations that affected microtubule stability and induced conformational change(s) to the 2ME2-binding site on &#946;-tubulin. Two of the mutations resided in the colchicine-binding site, yet did not affect colchicine sensitivity, suggesting that 2ME2 and colchicine differ in their binding to &#946;-tubulin. These 2ME2-resistant leukaemia cells have provided novel insights into microtubule stability and drug-target interactions to the tubulin molecule. Differential proteomics analysis identified alterations in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins in the 2ME2-resistant leukaemia cells, including a significant increase in class II &#946;-tubulin. Furthermore, &#947;-enolase and galectin-1 were up-regulated and class IVb &#946;-tubulin was down-regulated in 2ME2-resistant cells. Gene specific knockdown of class II &#946;-tubulin expression in neuroblastoma cells using small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to 2ME2 and other colchicine-binding agents, suggesting that class II &#946;-tubulin plays a functional role in drug resistance and sensitivity. In a clinically relevant NOD/SCID ALL mouse xenograft model, orally active 2ME2 and its analogue, ENMD-1198, increased survival rates in human ALL xenografts compared to control mice. ENMD-1198 showed better activity than 2ME2 against the ALL xenografts. Combining two microtubule-destabilising agents, ENMD-1198 and vincristine, demonstrated synergistic effect by causing microtubule disruption, angiogenesis and cell proliferation inhibition, and apoptosis induction in leukaemia cells. Importantly, ENMD-1198 and vincristine combination was more potent than single agent treatment in a vincristine-resistant ALL xenograft. In conclusion, this thesis identified novel mechanisms of resistance to 2ME2 and developed a new therapeutic strategy that could improve the treatment of drug refractory childhood ALL.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43558</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Politically unbecoming: critiques of "democracy" and postsocialist art from Europe</field><field name="creator">Gardner, Anthony Marshall, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a theoretical and historical account of how artists have responded to politics of democracy since the late-1980s. Three questions guide the direction of this analysis. Firstly: why, during its apparent apotheosis in recent years, have numerous artists critiqued democracy as the political, critical and aesthetic frame within which to identify their work? Secondly: how have artists undertaken this critique? Thirdly, and most importantly: what aesthetic and political discourses have artists proposed in lieu of the democracy that they critique?  Particular case studies of art from Europe help us to address these questions, for Europe has been an important crucible for vociferous, and often fraught, arguments about democracy in recent aesthetic, philosophical and political discourses. The first chapter of this thesis rigorously contextualises these discourses in relation to historical mobilisations of democracy since the Iron Curtain??s collapse. Relying on writings by Pat Simpson, Slavoj ??i??ek, Alain Badiou and Mario Tronti, I chart the significant imbrications of political ideology, philosophy and what I call ??aesthetics of democratisation?? from the end of European communism, through the democratisations of postcommunism to the militarised democratisations of Iraq and Afghanistan after 2001. Notions of democracy shift and change during this period, becoming what ??i??ek calls a problematic ??transcendental guarantee?? of assumed values and self-legitimation. These shifting values in turn propel the concurrent critiques of democracy that are the subjects of the five subsequent chapters: Ilya Kabakov??s ??total?? installations; Neue Slowenische Kunst??s mimicry of the nation-state during the 1990s; Thomas Hirschhorn??s large-scale works from the late-1990s onwards; Christoph B??chel and Gianni Motti??s collaborative ventures; and the co-operative practices of Dan and Lia Perjovschi. Through examination of the artists?? installations and voluminous writings, and based primarily on archival research and interviews, this thesis examines how their aesthetic politics emerge from the remobilisation of nonconformist art histories, through self-instituted contexts and alternative models for art production, exhibition and interpretation. These models, I argue, counter our usual understandings of art practice and its politics in Europe. They cumulatively assert ??postsocialist aesthetics?? as an impertinent, yet urgent, prism through which to analyse contemporary art.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Post-socialism</field><field name="subject">Contemporary Art</field><field name="subject">Democracy</field><field name="subject">Post-communism</field><field name="subject">Ilya Kabakov</field><field name="subject">Manifesta Biennial</field><field name="subject">IRWIN</field><field name="subject">Thomas Hirschhorn</field><field name="subject">Christoph B??chel</field><field name="subject">Gianni Motti</field><field name="subject">Perjovschi</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42880</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of the role of novel hormone regulated genes in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis</field><field name="creator">Hilton, Heidi Nicole, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mammary gland development is controlled by hormones such as progesterone and prolactin, which activate a genomic regulatory network. Identification of the components and regulatory links that comprise this network will provide the basis for defining the network's dynamic response during normal development and its perturbation during breast carcinogenesis. This thesis investigates two molecules in detail, Elf5 and KIBRA, which were identified as potential prolactin targets in a transcript profiling screen for key members in this genetic program of mammary morphogenesis. We examined the effect of expression of Elf5, a transcription factor critical in alveolar differentiation, in a 3D culture model of non-transformed mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. We discovered that Elf5 expression was selectively repressed over time in these cells when cultured on a basement membrane, and that Elf5 overexpression disrupted the architecture of acini resulting in luminal filling. This occurred due to an increase in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with repressed the induction of the pro-apoptotic molecule, Bim. We also observed that Elf5 is up-regulated with progesterone treatment, and that suppression of Elf5 expression in T47D breast cancer cells inhibits proliferation. Data obtained from the suppression of Elf5 expression in the presence of progesterone suggested that the role played by Elf5 in the Pg signalling pathway in T47D cells is relatively minor, and that rather than being a major downstream factor, the induction of Elf5 expression is utilised more to influence and potentiate other signalling pathways, such as the Prl pathway.  We characterised expression of KIBRA in the mammary gland and breast cancer cell lines, and observed that KIBRA was also up-regulated with progesterone treatment. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified the tyrosine kinase receptor DDR1 as a binding partner of KIBRA. We have demonstrated that the WW domains of KIBRA bind to a PPxY motif in DDR1, and that these molecules dissociate upon treatment with the DDR1 ligand, collagen. Finally, overexpression and knockdown studies demonstrate that KIBRA promotes the collagen-stimulated activation of the MAPK cascade. Thus KIBRA may play a role in how the reproductive state influences the mammary epithelial cell to respond to changing cell-context information, such as experienced during the tissue remodelling events of mammary gland development. Overall, the data presented in this thesis contributes to our growing knowledge of the genetic program responsible for mammary development and carcinogenesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">progesterone</field><field name="subject">mammary development</field><field name="subject">prolactin</field><field name="subject">KIBRA</field><field name="subject">Elf5</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of institutional factors on disclosure level of director and executive remuneration in Australia</field><field name="creator">Riaz, Zahid, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the role of three institutional factors (regulative; normative and cultural-cognitive pillars of institutions) in addressing agency problems of Australia. In the wake of the series of corporate collapses of current decade, director and executive remuneration was identified as one of the major causes behind these scandals. The Australian government and other related organisations made both regulative and non-regulative institutional reforms to manage this agency conflict. These reforms, encapsulated in Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP) Act 2004 demanded an increased level of disclosure of director and executive remuneration particularly, the disclosure of performance based salary. Subsequently, these amendments provided an opportunity through a non-binding vote to shareholders to participate in executive remuneration decisions.  This study proposes a new synthesis of institutional and agency theories by examining how institutional interventions addresses agency conflicts in the Australian context. A conceptual model is developed to measure both the conjoined and distinctive institutional impact on the disclosure level of director and executive remuneration in Australia. To measure and quantify the aforementioned impact a mixed method research strategy was used. First, content analysis as an investigative tool was used to develop a disclosure index which determined the level of disclosure of director and executive remuneration from top 100 Australian listed entities. Second, a conceptual model, positing the relationships between independent and dependent variables was verified through an econometric analysis of collected data, performed through the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15.  The findings of this research reveal that there exists a significant difference between the levels of disclosure in the pre and post stages of the introduction of the CLERP Act 2004. This result highlights the significance of regulatory intervention in addressing agency conflicts. The study also indicates that regulative and normative pillars have a higher impact than the culture-cognitive pillar on disclosure practices of Australian firms. In light of these results, the new blend between agency and institutional theories highlight the role of different institutions, particularly the government, in stabilising the organisational practices for good governance and creating national competitive advantages.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disclosure of executive remuneration.</field><field name="subject">Agency conflicts.</field><field name="subject">Institutional theory.</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43581</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the zebrafish scube gene family in Hedgehog signalling and slow muscle development.</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Jacque-Lynne Francine Annette, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hedgehog (Hh) signalling from the notochord induces the slow muscle cell fate in the adaxial cells of the developing zebrafish embryo.  Slow muscle formation is disrupted in zebrafish ??you-type?? mutants resulting in U-shaped somites.  In many you-type mutants, genes encoding components of the Hh signalling pathway are mutated.  scube2, a gene not previously known to be involved in Hh signalling, is disrupted in the you-type mutant ??you??.   you mutants are deficient in several Hh dependent cell types and show decreased expression of Hh target genes.  The Scube (signal peptide-CUB domain-EGF-related) family of proteins act as secreted glycoproteins or cell-surface proteins and are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions and ligand binding.  At the protein level, the Scube family resembles the endocytic receptor Cubilin.  Cubilin is known to interact with another endocytic receptor Megalin, which can function as an endocytic receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) in vitro.  Megalin endocytosis of Shh may be an important part of the Hh signal transduction pathway.  An anti-Scube2 antibody was developed during this work to investigate the intracellular localization pattern of Scube2 and facilitate the identification of potential Scube2 binding partner(s).  In addition, this work identified and characterized two homologs of scube2 in zebrafish, scube 1 and scube 3.  The high level of similarity amongst the Scube family of proteins and the weak phenotype of the you mutant suggested scube1 and scube3 might also be involved in slow muscle development.  Loss of function experiments performed by antisense morpholino knockdown of scube1 and scube3 in the you mutant decreases the expression of Hh target genes to levels seen in embryos lacking Hh signalling and dramatically enhances the loss of slow muscle fibres compared to you mutants alone.  Thus, injecting both scube1 and scube3 morpholinos into you blocks Hh signalling and these embryos fail to develop slow muscle.  Inhibition of the three partially redundant scube genes inhibits Hh signalling in zebrafish embryos, thereby demonstrating the essential requirement for scube gene function in the Hh signalling pathway.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">zebrafish</field><field name="subject">muscle development</field><field name="subject">Hedgehog signalling</field><field name="subject">scube gene family</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43316</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constructive neural networks : generalisation, convergence and architectures</field><field name="creator">Treadgold, Nicholas K., Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Feedforward neural networks trained via supervised learning have proven to be successful in the field of pattern recognition. The most important feature of a pattern recognition technique is its ability to successfully classify future data. This is known as generalisation. A more practical aspect of pattern recognition methods is how quickly they can be trained and how reliably a good solution is found. Feedforward neural networks have been shown to provide good generali- sation on a variety of problems. A number of training techniques also exist that provide fast convergence. Two problems often addressed within the field of feedforward neural networks are how to improve thegeneralisation and convergence of these pattern recognition techniques. These two problems are addressed in this thesis through the frame- work of constructive neural network algorithms. Constructive neural networks are a type of feedforward neural network in which the network architecture is built during the training process. The type of architecture built can affect both generalisation and convergence speed. Convergence speed and reliability areimportant properties of feedforward neu- ral networks. These properties are studied by examining different training al- gorithms and the effect of using a constructive process. A new gradient based training algorithm, SARPROP, is introduced. This algorithm addresses the problems of poor convergence speed and reliability when using a gradient based training method. SARPROP is shown to increase both convergence speed and the chance of convergence to a good solution. This is achieved through the combination of gradient based and Simulated Annealing methods. The convergence properties of various constructive algorithms are examined through a series of empirical studies. The results of these studies demonstrate that the cascade architecture allows for faster, more reliable convergence using a gradient based method than a single layer architecture with a comparable num- ber of weights. It is shown that constructive algorithms that bias the search direction of the gradient based training algorithm for the newly added hidden neurons, produce smaller networks and more rapid convergence. A constructive algorithm using search direction biasing is shown to converge to solutions with networks that are unreliable and ine??cient to train using a non-constructive gradient based algorithm. The technique of weight freezing is shown to result in larger architectures than those obtained from training the whole network. Improving the generalisation ability of constructive neural networks is an im- portant area of investigation. A series of empirical studies are performed to examine the effect of regularisation on generalisation in constructive cascade al- gorithms. It is found that the combination of early stopping and regularisation results in better generalisation than the use of early stopping alone. A cubic regularisation term that greatly penalises large weights is shown to be benefi- cial for generalisation in cascade networks. An adaptive method of setting the regularisation magnitude in constructive networks is introduced and is shown to produce generalisation results similar to those obtained with a fixed, user- optimised regularisation setting. This adaptive method also oftenresults in the construction of smaller networks for more complex problems. The insights obtained from the SARPROP algorithm and from the convergence and generalisation empirical studies are used to create a new constructive cascade algorithm, acasper. This algorithm is extensively benchmarked and is shown to obtain good generalisation results in comparison to a number of well-respected and successful neural network algorithms. A technique of incorporating the validation data into the training set after network construction is introduced and is shown to generally result in similar or improved generalisation. The di??culties of implementing a cascade architecture in VLSI are described and results are given on the effect of the cascade architecture on such attributes as weight growth, fan-in, network depth, and propagation delay. Two variants of the cascade architecture are proposed. These new architectures are shown to produce similar generalisation results to the cascade architecture, while also addressing the problems of VLSI implementation of cascade networks.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks Computer science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A UI-driven approach to facilitating effective development of rich and composite web applications</field><field name="creator">Yu, Jin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is well-recognized that the development of user interfaces is one of the most time-consuming tasks in the overall application development process. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for rich and fluid user interfaces from web users. As a result, developers are facing increasing challenges in delivering web applications, especially those with rich UI requirements.  In this thesis we present two solutions to facilitate the execution and rapid development of web applications with rich user interfaces. The first solution is a rich internet application (RIA) framework aimed at providing high usability and productivity to web applications, while the second solution is a UI integration framework that simplifies web application development by facilitating the composition of reusable UI components.  The foundation of our RIA framework is an XML-based high-level protocol for communicating asynchronous events and incremental UI updates on the web. The protocol facilitates rich and highly interactive UI, while at the same time eliminates frequent and slow page refreshes and provides a more responsive user experience.  Built on top of the protocol, a server-side runtime allows UI logic code to be executed on the server side, while a set of server-side event-driven API enables developers to implement sophisticated application-specific UI behavior. On the client side, a thin client renders UI and processes native events, but leaves application-specific logic to the server side. The thin client thus allows end users to enjoy a rich UI experience in a safe client environment, without executing any downloaded code.  The proposed UI integration framework includes an abstract UI component model which allows UI components to be programmatically manipulated via events, operations, and properties, essentially exposing UI as services. To facilitate component interactions, the framework offers an event-based composition model, which allows integration logic to be specified in the form of event listeners.  Composite applications are executed via a lightweight runtime middleware, which provides component adapters that allow the middleware to communicate with native UI components implemented in a variety of languages and platforms. Finally, a graphical development environment allows composite applications to be built in a drag-and-drop fashion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43350</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Attentional coping strategies in the management of pain in children</field><field name="creator">Jaaniste, Tiina, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this series of studies was to investigate the efficacy of attentional coping strategies in altering children's responses to a painful experience. After a review of the theoretical and empirical links between pain experience and attention, Studies 1-4 compared the efficacy of imagery-based strategies that focussed attention away from a painful experience (distraction) or towards a painful experience (sensory-focussing) on 7- to 14-year-old children??s responses to cold-pressor pain. Image calibration studies (Studies 1-2) ensured that the imagery interventions were matched for other important parameters including affect and vividness. Studies 3 and 4 found that imagery-based attentional coping strategies led to increased tolerance of cold-pressor pain relative to a no-treatment control. Study 3 found that younger children (7-9 years) had better pain outcomes when assigned to the distraction condition than the sensory-focussing condition. For older children (10-14 years) the efficacy of different attentional interventions depended on the degree to which the strategy matched the child's preferred use of distraction as a coping style, providing partial support for the congruence hypothesis. Studies 5-6 tested the novel hypothesis that provision of sensory information before a painful experience may enhance the efficacy of an attentional coping strategy such as distraction. In line with self-regulation theory, children who received preparatory sensory information as well as a distraction intervention showed longer pain tolerance, lower pain intensity ratings, and a trend towards less facial pain expressions than if they received either intervention alone. These findings are discussed in terms of key attentional theories, and theories of attentional development. Implications for theory, clinical practice and further research are also considered.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">child</field><field name="subject">pain</field><field name="subject">attention</field><field name="subject">coping</field><field name="subject">distraction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on international financial integration, international equity holdings and financial volatility</field><field name="creator">Vo, Xuan Vinh, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to analyse international financial integration. Chapter 2 investigates the determinants of international financial integration. Variables including the capital control policy dummy variable, openness to international trade, domestic credit and economic growth are candidates for explaining variation in the degree of international financial integration.  Chapter 3 analyses cointegration between the US and several European Union equity markets. Between 1993 and 1998, there is mixed evidence of cointegration ties with the US equity market. Over the period covering the introduction of the euro, most of the European markets did not show any evidence of cointegration with the US market. Granger causality tests reveal significant causality running from the US to the European markets. Chapter 4 estimates time series of market and idiosyncratic volatilities for the firms composing the index DJ Eurostoxx 50 following the volatility decomposition method of Campbell et al. (2001). There was a positive trend in both market and firm-level volatility and average correlation among firms has increased. This contrasts with the US evidence in Campbell et al. (2001) of a strong positive trend in firm-level volatility, no trend in market volatility and a decrease in the average correlation. Results confirm a statistically significant market risk-return trade-off and that firm-level volatility has no predictive power for subsequent market returns.  Chapter 5 analyses the link between FDI and economic growth using panel data.  FDI has a stronger positive impact on economic growth in countries with higher levels of education attainment, those that are more open to international trade, have better stock market development and lower rates of population growth and levels of risk. Chapter 6 investigates the determinants of the home bias. Results indicate that capital controls and transaction costs are factors driving the home bias of Australian equity portfolio investment. The home bias lessens if the bilateral trade is higher. Australian investors invest a higher share of their portfolio in countries with better institutions and larger market size.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equity integration</field><field name="subject">International Financial Integration</field><field name="subject">Home bias</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An In Vivo histological, and In Vitro biomechanical study of nucleus replacement with a novel polymeric hydrogel</field><field name="creator">Pelletier, Matthew Henry, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nucleus replacement has recently come into favor as a possible treatment for Degenerative Disc Disease. Replacing degenerative nucleus tissue with a synthetic material that mimics healthy nucleus tissue may restore normal function and biomechanics to the disc and delay or obviate the need for more invasive procedures such as total disc replacement and fusion. This thesis evaluated a novel protein polymer hydrogel composed of silk and elastin as a nucleus replacement material. There are three experimental components; one in vivo and two in vitro portions. In the first experimental portion, a large animal model was developed to evaluate the biocompatibility of the material as well as the effect on surrounding boney and soft tissues. Three discs were evaluated in each animal; sham, discectomy and discectomy treated with hydrogel. Discs were evaluated at 4, 26 and 52 weeks. The hydrogel group showed a quiet cellular response, as well as decreased boney remodeling and fewer degenerative changes when compared to the discectomy group. The second experimental portion evaluated the biomechanics of 9 cadaveric motion segments loaded in axial rotation, lateral bending, flexion/extension (FE) and compression. Specimens were tested sequentially in the intact state, following annulotomy, discectomy and after hydrogel treatment. Range of Motion (ROM) in FE was shown to increase from the intact state (8.50+/-1.44&#730;) to the discectomy state (9.86+/-1.77&#730;) and decrease following hydrogel treatment (8.66+/-0.76&#730;) to be similar to the intact ROM. The third experimental portion investigates the effect of three commonly applied testing conditions on the mechanical properties of spinal segments. 27 motion segments were tested at 18&#730;C wrapped with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS), at 37&#730;C in a PBS bath, and at 37&#730;C and 100% humidity. Specimens were tested hourly for 6 hours. The heated conditions were shown to have lower stiffness and increased range of motion when compared 18 &#730;C tests. Repeated testing with time increased neutral zone and ROM for all modes of bending. As tests are repeated over time, tissue properties change and may mask the ability of a nucleus replacement to restore biomechanics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biomechanics</field><field name="subject">spine</field><field name="subject">nucleus pulposus</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43319</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of bladder cancer progression</field><field name="creator">Hung, Tzong Tyng, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bladder cancer (BlCa) is the second most common genitourinary cancer, affecting both men and women. Most (70%) cases present at the superficial stage; 20% of these recur with muscle-invasive disease. Major genetic alterations associated with BlCa include: loss/gain in expression or mutations in Retinoblastoma (RB) gene, human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs), H-ras, p53 and FGFR3. Only p53 mutations are well correlated with invasive BlCa; other changes show variable correlations with disease status. To understand the progression of BlCa, a model of nine human BlCa cell sublines derived from a single parent but differing in in vivo characteristics, has been developed previously. These cells represent a heterogenous population from a single tumour and a model of different stages of BlCa progression, from non-tumourigenic to invasive. Two sublines were selected for further investigation: C3 (non-tumourigenic) and B8 (invasive). These were transfected with green (C3-GSP-2) and red fluorescent reporters (B8-RSP-gck) respectively to investigate the effects of their co-injection in vivo, specifically, promotion of C3 tumour growth by B8 cells. Surprisingly, B8 tumour growth was inhibited by C3 cells in vivo at different cell numbers and proportions of cells injected. Microarray analysis of C3 and B8 cells revealed differential expression of 1367 genes with dramatic differences in the transforming growth factor-?? and integrin-mediated pathways. Gene expression of BMP2, INHBB, FST, NOG, ID4 and TGF- ??1, in the TGF- ?? pathway was further analysed with qRT-PCR in all nine sublines. Expression of BMP2 was significantly related to tumourigenic potential (p=0.0238, Mann-Whitney) and INHBB to invasive ability (p=0.0476, Mann-Whitney). The BlCa model did not include a metastatic component. To broaden the model, cell lines were established from an invaded lymph-node (B8-RSP-LN) and a bone-metastasis (B8-RSP-BN) after subcutaneous and intra-cardiac injection of B8-RSP-gck cells. No significant differences were observed in the migratory capability and anchorage-independent colony formation of these metastatic cells compared with B8 cells. Evaluation of expression of the panel of TGF-beta genes (BMP2, INHBB, FST, NOG, ID4 and TGF- ??1) and metastasis-related genes (MMP9, MMP2 and KAI1) indicated that expression of BMP2, FST, ID4 and MMP9 was decreased or lost in the metastatic sublines.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Progression</field><field name="subject">Bladder cancer</field><field name="subject">Transforming growth factor beta</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Australian perspective on talent development in music: The influence of environmental catalysts upon the provision of opportunities for learning, training and practice in the musical domain</field><field name="creator">Chadwick, Felicia, School of Education Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study explored the influence of environmental catalysts, upon the provision of field specific opportunities for learning, training, and practice, for a sample population of musically involved young Australians. The findings enhance understandings of the conditions in which children's musical aptitudes are developed. Research bases in the fields of gifted education and music education were employed to support the investigation. Components of Gagn??'s Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (1995a) provided the theoretical framework for this investigation. Two survey questionnaires, completed by Australian parents (N = 194 and N = 182 respectively), sought information pertaining to the subject child's musical involvements and undertakings. Some details of the musical interests and involvements of the child's parents and siblings were also obtained. Quantitative and qualitative data contribute to an extensive profile of the types of music programs and provisions which support the normative and expert development of Australian children's musical behaviours.  Parents' musical interests and involvements appear to have strongly influenced the choice of home-based recreational pursuits for their children. The convincingly articulated, positive, field specific views espoused by Australian parents appear to have been translated into the provision of multiple, simultaneous opportunities for their children to engage with musical undertakings. Notable amongst the data are the structured involvements of young musicians with music composition engagements. The data also indicate that many of the sample of Australian children received high levels of support and encouragement for musical undertakings from parents who were themselves musically interested and knowledgeable. Parental involvements with their children's music lesson and practice related engagements, were found to be characterised by features of deliberate practice.  The home-based environments of young Australian musicians were found to be characterised by opportunities for exposure to rigorous and challenging musical engagements, undertaken at an optimally early age, thereby enhancing normative musical development. Such engagements provided the necessary foundation for expert levels of musical skill acquisition. An ascending progression of musical skill development was demonstrated to correspond to increasing age further reinforcing the developmental perspective on the acquisition of musical expertise. Some parents indicate that musical engagement has been pursued as a means of appropriately challenging children exhibiting the cognitive and affective characteristics of giftedness.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gifted children Australia</field><field name="subject">Musical ability</field><field name="subject">Music Instruction and study Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic threshold range aggregate query processing over uncertain data</field><field name="creator">Yang, Shuxiang, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Uncertainty is inherent in many novel and important applications such as market surveillance, information extraction sensor data analysis, etc. In the recent a few decades, uncertain data has attracted considerable research attention. There are various factors that cause the uncertainty, for instance randomness or incompleteness of data, limitations of equipment and delay or loss in data transfer.  A probabilistic threshold range aggregate (PRTA) query retrieves summarized information about the uncertain objects in the database satisfying a range query, with respect to a given probability threshold. This thesis is trying to address and handle this important type of query which there is no previous work studying on.  We formulate the problem in both discrete and continuous uncertain data model and develop a novel index structure, asU-tree (aggregate-based sampling-auxiliary U-tree) which not only supports exact query answering but also provides approximate results with accuracy guarantee if efficiency is more concerned. The new asU-tree structure is totally dynamic. Query processing algorithms for both exact answer and approximate answer based on this new index structure are also proposed. An extensive experimental study shows that asU-tree is very efficient and effective over real and synthetic datasets.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">asU-tree</field><field name="subject">Uncertain data</field><field name="subject">Range aggregate query</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dangerous liaisons: the predation risks of receiving olfactory signals</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Nelika Karen, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Individuals are at risk when communicating because conspicuous signals attract both conspecifics and eavesdropping predators. This predation cost of communicating has typically been attributed to signalling individuals because of their conspicuous role. But if predators are attracted to signals, then receivers, both intended or otherwise, may also find themselves at risk of predation. In this thesis, I used olfactorily communicating house mice Mus domesticus to address several key questions regarding the predation risks to receivers of conspecific signals. Using field experiments, I established that several predator species are rapidly attracted to the scent signals of their mouse prey. Male house mice were sensitive to this risk of predation when receiving conspecific signals. Mice traded off the predation risks of receiving with the perceived social value of a conspecific scent signal, however, and were more willing to receive signals of high social value than those of low social value when in the presence of a predation cue. But mice did not relinquish all antipredatory behaviours to receive signals. Instead, spatial point pattern analyses revealed that they used small-scale changes in space use to maintain receiving rates of conspecific signals, while minimising excess movements likely to attract a predator??s attention. Mice were also sensitive to the risks posed by scents in different spatial configurations. They perceived patchily distributed scents as more risky than randomly or regularly distributed scents, highlighting the importance of considering scale when examining predator:prey interactions. I further extended the concept of risky receiving to show that it includes interspecific eavesdropping ?? greatly generalising our concept of the landscape of fear. In a final laboratory experiment, I reveal a mechanism for the otherwise maladaptive maintenance of receiving under predation risk. The effects of social isolation on aggressive and anti-social behaviours were gradually attenuated by exposing male mice to the scents of an increasing number of conspecifics, despite a lack of physical contact. Thus, while prey are sensitive to the increased risks of predation when receiving con- and hetero-specific signals, they must balance this risk against the perceived social benefits of receiving a signal, and the potentially severe social costs of not doing so.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">No alarms and no surprises; the rise of the domestic non-place</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Tim, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The term non-place is defined by Marc Aug?? as 'a space that cannot be defined as relational, or historical, or concerned with identity.' The key defining factor for Aug?? is that non-places are transitory; they are spaces we flow through. As such any effect they have on us is temporary. This thesis charts the spread of the non-place from spaces of transit to spaces of habitation and the consequences which ensue.  The appearance of the non-place in high schools is examined, looking specifically at the spate of random mass shootings that have occurred in America since 1992. The shootings are an act of extreme performance, facilitated by the architectonics of the non-place. In the contemporary office we see how the principles of late capitalism have incorporated the principles of the non-place to isolate and control the precariat employee. The mall presents the first example of how the non-place has become both habitable and desirable. The pure singularity of the mall&#146;s consumer community not only makes us feel comfortable but it also enables the oxymoronic position of sincerely performing. The home, the so-called foundation of identity, memory and place, is revealed as a non-place in which we are required to be both the producer and consumer of performed identity. The Internet is not a non-place in itself but it is used as a means of expressing non-place sexuality. The Internet is vital to our understanding of the quotidian practicalities of the non-place individual. The non-place is also examined through the poetics of practice. Produced with this thesis is a series of works which wallow in, critique and challenge the non-place.  If the non-place's ambition is universality then the temporary effects becomes permanent. Jean-luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben and George Bataille provide the philosophic platform from which these effects can be properly examined. Through an extensive engagement with constructs of community, identity and performance the true ramifications of the domestication of the non-place is revealed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43718</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time and memory in the novels of Eleanor Dark</field><field name="creator">O'Reilly, Helen Edna, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I will demonstrate that Eleanor Dark's over-riding themes are time and memory. Time informs the structure of her novels, she juxtaposes past and present. Memory in all its aspects, personal, cultural, racial dominates both her contemporary novels and The Timeless Land trilogy. The thesis considers Dark's fiction in sequence to chart her treatment of time and memory.  Simultaneously Dark was reaching into her own reservoir ofmemory and transfiguring her own experience in the characters, events and locations of her novels. In this oblique way, and through this unique form of modelling, Dark reveals little known areas of her life. Biographically Dark remains elusive; the surface events of her life are well documented but do not account for the drama of her character portrayals, the immediacy of her perceptions of the natural world, her deep intellectual responses to art, literature and politics, as well as her preoccupation with time.  It is my contention that Dark's creative thrust was inwards; she developed the inner processes of memory and imagination. Time and memory cohere in her novels; under scrutiny they bring new interpretations to her work, and new insights into her life.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43355</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The efficacy of a pedometer based intervention in increasing physical activity in cardiac patients in the community</field><field name="creator">Butler, Lyra, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rationale Within Australia, cardiac rehabilitation attendance is poor, with typically thirty percent of eligible patients attending programs. The majority of cardiac patients are not receiving the support or detailed information required to increase physical activity participation after hospitalisation. Further, many cardiac patients are not exercising independently, regardless of their attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. As physical activity is important in the prevention and treatment of heart disease, there could be substantial benefits to the individual and cost savings for the health system if cardiac patients were more active. Physical activity interventions based on social cognitive theory have demonstrated success in improving physical activity among people with chronic diseases. However, there is little research conducted with cardiac patients, in particular, with those who do not attend cardiac rehabilitation. This research addresses this gap in public health practice by providing an intervention to cardiac patients, irrespective of their attendance at cardiac rehabilitation, thereby addressing a population that is often overlooked and hard to reach.  Research aims ??	To determine the uptake rate of cardiac rehabilitation in the north Illawarra and Shoalhaven areas of New South Wales and identify the characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation attendees and non attendees. ??	To evaluate the efficacy of a pedometer based physical activity intervention in cardiac patients referred to cardiac rehabilitation. Methodology This thesis consisted of three related studies: a cross sectional analysis of the characteristics of cardiac rehabilitation referrals (n = 944) over a 10 month period; and two randomised controlled trials conducted simultaneously. The Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial participants (n = 110) were patients who had attended cardiac rehabilitation; Community Trial participants (n = 215) were those who did not attend cardiac rehabilitation. The six week intervention evaluated in the trials included self monitoring of daily physical activity using a pedometer and step calendar, and two behavioural counselling and goal setting sessions delivered via telephone. Additional support for intervention group participants was provided through two brief telephone calls made after the six week intervention period. Self reported physical activity levels were collected at baseline, six weeks and six months. The questionnaire also collected information about psychosocial factors affecting physical activity participation. The exercise capacity of the participants in the Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial was objectively measured at baseline, six weeks and six months using a gas exchange analysis system. Results The cardiac rehabilitation uptake rate was 28.8 per cent of referred patients. Cardiac rehabilitation attendees were significantly younger and more likely to have had a coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABGS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure than non attendees.  Study groups in both trials were not significantly different at baseline. In the Cardiac Rehabilitation Trial, improvements in total weekly physical activity sessions (p=0.002), walking time (p=0.013) and walking sessions (p&lt;0.001) in the intervention group were significantly greater than the change in the control group at the end of the six week intervention. At six months, improvements in the intervention group remained significantly greater than the control group in total physical activity time (p=0.044), total physical activity sessions (p=0.016) and walking sessions (p=0.035) after adjusting for baseline differences. These self reported behavioural changes were corroborated by improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness at six months in the intervention group (p=0.010). Improvements in the intervention group in behavioural (p=0.039) and cognitive (p=0.024) self management strategy use were significantly greater than the controls at six weeks after adjusting for baseline differences. The improvement in cognitive strategy use (p=0.001) remained significantly greater in the intervention group compared to controls at six months after adjusting for baseline differences. Self efficacy, outcome expectancies and psychological distress were not significantly different between groups at six weeks or six months after adjusting for baseline differences. In the Community Trial, improvements in total weekly physical activity time (p=0.027), total physical activity sessions (p=0.003), walking time (p=0.013) and walking sessions (p=0.002) in the intervention group were significantly greater than the control group at six weeks after adjusting for baseline differences. At six months, improvements in total physical activity time (p=0.015), total physical activity sessions (p=0.019), walking time (p=0.002) and walking sessions (p=0.026) in the intervention group remained significantly greater than the control group after adjusting for baseline differences. Improvements in outcome expectancies (p=0.038) and cognitive self management strategy use (p=0.028) in the intervention group were significantly greater than the change in the control group at six weeks, after adjusting for baseline differences. However, these differences did not remain significant at six months.  Conclusion This research showed that participation in a six week pedometer based intervention significantly increased the physical activity level and psychosocial status of people with heart disease. These findings suggest the pedometer based intervention could be offered as an effective and accessible option for those who do not attend cardiac rehabilitation to increase their physical activity levels. This intervention could also be promoted as an important adjunct to existing cardiac rehabilitation programs to promote adherence to physical activity after cardiac rehabilitation attendance. These studies provide community based evidence of an effective physical activity intervention for those eligible for cardiac rehabilitation, including those who do not attend. This provides a public health approach to cardiac rehabilitation programs and has the potential to improve health outcomes in this population.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pedometer</field><field name="subject">cardiac rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="subject">randomised controlled trial</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The magic of the city: representing places of the dead in the contemporary Western metropolis</field><field name="creator">Trigg, Rachel Helen, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis posits that throughout history, the Western city has been made and understood according to a shared image of the cosmos. It argues that though the contours of this cosmos have changed over time and place, collectively held understandings of the city endure to the present day. Drawing on literary and cultural theory, this way of understanding the city may be conceptualised as ??magical??, that is incorporating knowledge which is hermeneutic and mythical, as well as empirical.  The specific example of places of the dead, understood as cemeteries, memorials and other locations at which the dead are actually or symbolically interred, is used in this thesis to test the notion that that the city may continue to be understood as a reflection of world view. Places of the dead provide an appropriate test case for this task, as their forms and locations have clear associations with temporally and culturally specific understandings of the city. This thesis applies textual analysis and discourse analysis to seven case studies of contemporary places of the dead in order to examine the way in which the magic of the city may operate in one typology of place. It considers the representation of these case studies in a large array of texts, with particular emphasis on fictional, and thus potentially ??magical??, texts such as novels, television series and architectural drawings, as well as postcards, movies, cartoons, photographs, songs and paintings.  The results of the case studies are used to argue not only that the city continues to be understood using a wide variety of ways of knowing, but also that these alternative epistemologies offer insights into contemporary cities which are not gained through the use of conventional methodologies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Western city</field><field name="subject">Cemeteries</field><field name="subject">Memorials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43339</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The dream ?? or, an unthinkable history: written in memory of women transported to Botany Bay 1787-1788</field><field name="creator">Phillip, Joan Contessa, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Written in memory of the first women convicts transported to Botany Bay, this unthinkable history, a concept posed by the historian, Paul Carter, is an experiment in extending the boundaries of academic remembering, so that the complex lives of those resilient women might be given recognition. Researching the women??s lives required an ethnographic method, or ??spatialized?? history, based on original archival research, together with research of rituals, art, literature, newspapers and music; and, importantly, the laws which circumscribed their behaviour.  A research focus was thus the administration of criminal codes and the character of prominent judges, including the significance of the Recorder of London. Theories of history based on the work of philosophers such as Heidegger, Deleuze, Guattari, Derrida, Foucault and the ethical philosopher, Wyschogrod, with her feminist perspective, have influenced narrative themes and tropes.  This experimental hybridization of historical methods and the poetics of fiction might be classified as ficto-critical historiography, where ficto-critical functions as an epithet, not a polarity, as is the case with ficto-historiography and the coinage, faction. As a meditation on the ??maybe?? of historiography, the experiment enters the debates about the relationship between history and fiction and the significance of remembering. The incompleteness of records, their silences and partialities, the forensic reading required to contextualize them, the perspective from which the narrative is told, together with the metaphorical levels of all writing, are explicitly acknowledged.  Fundamental to that acknowledgement is the narrative trope of simulacra. The narrative figures are thus copies without originals; they are an acknowledgement of the absence which haunts memories, while avoiding scepticism or relativity.  The semi-omniscient, intrusive voice of the narrator, the dialogic placement of other ??voices??, variously contrary, affirmative, informative or philosophical; together with the acknowledged artifice of narrative dramatizations in which the figures are assembled from multiple sources, are important elements in the grammar of this transgressive act of remembering with its footnotes and phantoms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">1787 1788</field><field name="subject">Botany Bay</field><field name="subject">Convict women</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">802.11 positioning using signal strength fingerprinting</field><field name="creator">Salter, James William, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effectiveness of location aware applications is dependent on the accuracy of the supporting positioning system.

In this thesis, two surveying methods, five positioning algorithms, and two spatial output averaging methods are trialled. Accuracy is determined by empirical testing in two separate environments: a 100m square domestic house and the 1,333m square third floor of the University of New South Wales Computer Science and Engineering building. In the two environments, the lowest mean distance errors are 1.25m and 2.86m respectively.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Positioning.</field><field name="subject">802.11.</field><field name="subject">Wifi.</field><field name="subject">Fingerprinting.</field><field name="subject">Radio.</field><field name="subject">Localization.</field><field name="subject">Signal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Well defined stimuli-responsive cross-linked micelles as biocompatible drug/gene delivery system from RAFT polymerization</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Ling, Centre for Advanced Macromolecular Design, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The objective of this thesis is to investigate well-defined cross-linked particles synthesized via the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process that can be used for drug delivery. To achieve this aim, a wide range of cross-linked micelle systems have been synthesized and intensively investigated. Various biocompatible monomers were employed, including poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate, 2-hydroxyl ethyl acrylate, functionalized glucosamine and nucleotides containing monomers. Different cross-linked structures were used, for example, core-cross-linked, nexus-cross-linked and shell-cross-linked micelles. Diverse stimuli-responsive particles were used, such as pH-sensitive, thermo-sensitive and thiol-sensitive cross-linked systems. Evidences of the successful synthesis of all the resulting cross-linked products are given. They displayed better properties, as drug carriers, than non-cross-linked micelles. A thermo-responsive seven-arm star glycopolymer, synthesized via the RAFT process, was also investigated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RAFT polymerization</field><field name="subject">stimuli-responsive</field><field name="subject">cross-linked micelles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of the capacity for evidence-based policy and practice in Australian population health</field><field name="creator">Adily, Armita, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Evidence-based policy and practice (EBPP) in population health in Australia has been promoted largely without sound research.

Despite better diagnostic tools and improvement of surgical standards, the prognosis of this disease is still unsatisfactory with a mean 5-year cancer-specific survival of approximately 50%, mainly due to our inability to predict liver failure secondary to hepatic involvement and still poorly effective palliative treatments. The metastatic cascade is a complex, multistep process driven by progressive accumulation of genetic alterations which result in proto-oncogene activation and inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. Among the additional pathways involved in this process, secretion of angiogenesis factors, proteolysis of the extra-cellular matrix (ECM) molecules, and probably inhibition of apoptosis are also known to facilitate tumour progression. We undertook a retrospective study in a series of paraffin-embedded human colonic tissues to investigate the prognostic significance of new tumour markers as predictors of liver metastasis and survival in sporadic CRC. This research was conducted in three parts: first, immunohistochemical studies of protein markers and development of a new quantitative method of measurement in a subset of the immunostained sections using a colour video image analysis (VIA) procedure; second, concomitant determination of the expression of the bcl-2 gene at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, using a more specific methodology of in situ hybridisation (ISH) and investigation of the relationship between bcl-2 mRNA and its encoded protein expression; and third, investigation of microsatellite alterations at four loci using a fluorescent microsatelllite polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay coupled with an automated DNA sequencer. In our initial immunohistochemical experiment, we found a good correlation between colour VIA and semiquantitative evaluation of nm23 immunoreactivity (IR) confirming the validity of such quantitative analysis (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.88; P&lt;0.001). Furthermore, overexpression of nm23 was associated with an increased risk of developing liver metastases (logrank test for trend, P&lt;0.001) and cancer-related death (P=0.002). We used the same quantitative method to determine the expression of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and c-erbB-2 (HER2/neu) proteins and found that neither predicted patient outcome. However, CRC showing overexpression of u-PA (above 85 pixels) had an increased risk of liver metastasis (P=0.013). Since this was a post hoc analysis we can not be confident that this represents a real effect. There were significant positive correlations among expression of all three markers, u-PA, c-erbB-2 and nm23 proteins (u-PA vs c-erbB-2, Spearman rank correlation coefficient, P=0.003; u-PA vs nm23, P&lt;0.001; c-erbB-2 vs nm23, P=0.001) suggesting that, in vivo, all proteins interact or are similarly regulated. Semiquantitative analysis of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein showed that expression of VEGF was significantly reduced in the metastatic liver tumours compared to their matched primary ones (Wilcoxon test, P=0.002), suggesting VEGF activity to be secondarily down-regulated once the tumour cells reach the hepatic parenchyma. There was no strong evidence from our data that the level of VEGF in the primary tumour could predict risk of liver metastasis or survival duration. Finally, when semiquantitatively assessing five protein markers (nm23, p53, c-erbB- 2, u-PA, and VEGF) individually or in combination, we found that only nm23 protein expression was positively related to the risk of liver metastasis (logrank test, P&lt;0.001); p53 protein expression was only marginally associated (P=0.091). Furthermore, patients with Dukes' stage B tumours showing positive expression of nm23 protein also demonstrated an increased risk of liver metastasis (P=0.001). Although the risk of developing liver secondaries was statistically correlated with the number of positive markers (NPM) and the cumulative intensity score (CIS) (logrank test for trend, P=0.004 and P=0.001 respectively), these two parameters did not improve the predictive value over and above that of nm23 protein alone. These results suggest that the only marker of the five we studied that provides prognostic information about the risk of developing liver metastasis in CRC is nm23. Its evaluation may be particularly useful in selecting high risk Dukes' stage B patients who should be considered for adjuvant chemotherapy. In the second part of this study, immunohistochemical analysis using a monoclonal mouse antibody to the bcl-2 protein and in situ hybridisation using digoxigenin-labelled bcl-2 cRNA probes were carried out on the same paraffin-embedded specimens and semiquantitatively assessed. These specimens also included adenomas with various degrees of dysplasia. The expression of bcl-2 protein was gradually and significantly lost during the progression from moderately dysplastic adenoma to primary CRC [moderate/severe dysplasia: Mann-Whitney U-test, P=0.0001; severe dysplasia/primary CRC: P=0.027], whereas the cellular expression of bcl-2 mRNA was progressively increased during the dysplasia/adenoma-carcinoma neoplastic sequence. Our observation suggests that in a proportion of CRCs the bcl-2 proto-oncogene expression may be down-regulated at a post-transcriptional level. In the final section of this study, we investigated the possible relationship between loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MIN) at four microsatellite loci spanning the 17q21-23 region that includes the nm23-H1 and nm23- H2 genes, to the risk of liver metastasis and nm23 protein expression. Genomic DNA was extracted from the same series of paraffin-embedded colorectal specimens and a fluorescent PCR coupled with DNA fragment analysis in an automated DNA sequencer was applied. In 45% and 48% of the primary and secondary lesions, LOH was present in at least one locus. We found a positive correlation when looking for a trend comparing the fraction of sites with LOH at these loci to risk of liver recurrence (logrank test for trend, P=0.005). This remained an independent predictor after adjusting to T-stage (Multivariate Cox regression, P=0.022), N-stage (P=0.007), or Dukes' stage (P=0.012). MIN was present in 2 loci in 41% and 30% of the primary and secondary tumours respectively. Considering only the Dukes' B tumours, we found that an increasing number of sites showing MIN was associated with a reduced risk of liver recurrence (logrank test for trend, P=0.032). When comparing LOH and MIN status of the primary and matched liver secondary tumours with their corresponding normal tissue samples, we found concordant genomic alterations in 72% (NME1 locus) to 43% (D17S579). Finally, we observed a trend in association between the proportion of loci with LOH and nm23 positivity ( ?? 2 test for trend, P=0.024). These findings suggest that, genomic alterations in the 17q21-23 region may affect prognosis of CRC as well as regulation of the nm23 protein expression via a stillmechanism.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cancer</field><field name="subject">colon</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">rectum</field><field name="subject">metastasis</field><field name="subject">genetic markers</field><field name="subject">nm23</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B-related liver disease burden in Vietnam and Australia</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Van Thi Thuy, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infection (HBV) and estimates HBV-related liver disease burden in Vietnam and Australia using a cross-sectional study design and mathematical modelling.  A population-based seroprevalence survey was undertaken in rural Northern Vietnam. In a sample of 870 study participants, prevalence of anti-HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) was 68.2% and 19.0%, respectively, and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) was detected in 16.4% of the HBsAg-positive group. Factors associated with HBV infection (anti-HBc and/or HBsAg-positive) were age 60 years or older (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 3.82; 95% CI, 1.35??10.80; P = 0.01), residence in Vu Thu district (AOR, 3.00; 95% CI, 2.16??4.17; P &lt;0.001), hospital admission (AOR, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.33??4.13; P = 0.003) and history of acupuncture (AOR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.29??3.13; P = 0.002). Household contact with a person with liver disease (AOR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.29??3.52; P = 0.003), reuse of syringes (AOR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.25??2.62; P = 0.002) and sharing of razors (AOR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.03??2.79; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of HBsAg positivity. Alanine  aminotransferase (ALT) level was elevated (&gt;40 IU/L) in 43% of the HBsAg-positive group; the proportion of elevated ALT was higher in HBeAg-positive (65%) compared with HBeAg-negative (39%) (P = 0.02).  Based on data from the seroprevalence study, other prevalence estimates and HBV natural history parameters, a mathematical model was used to estimate HBV-related liver disease burden in Vietnam. Estimated chronic HBV prevalence increased from 6.4 million cases in 1990 to around 8.4 million cases in 2005 and was projected to decrease to 8.0 million by 2025. Estimated HBV-related liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence increased linearly from 21 900 and 9400 in 1990 to 58 650 and 25 000 in 2025. Estimated HBV-related mortality increased from 12 600 in 1990 to 40 000 in 2025. To estimate HBV-related HCC incidence among Australians born in the Asia-Pacific region (APR), a mathematical modelling was developed utilising HBV natural history parameters, HBV prevalence estimates in APR countries and immigration data. Chronic HBV cases among the APR-born population increased rapidly from the late 1970s, reaching a peak of 4182 in 1990. Chronic HBV prevalence increased to more than 53 000 in 2005. Estimates of HBV-related HCC increased linearly from one in 1960 to 140 in 2005, with a projected increase to 250 in 2025. Universal HBV vaccination programs in countries of origin had limited impact on projected HBV-related HCC to 2025.  HBV-related HCC survival was analysed in a population-based linkage study in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Between 1994 and 2002, 278 HCC cases notified to the NSW Cancer Registry were linked to chronic HBV infection notifications to the NSW Health Department. The majority of cases were male (83.5%) and overseas born (93.6%); Asian-born cases accounted for 72.1%. Median survival following HCC diagnosis was 15 months. HCC survival was poorer among older age groups (P &lt;0.001), and among cases with regional spread (HR 3.23; 95% CI, 1.83??5.69; P &lt;0.001) and distant metastases (HR 3.85; 95% CI, 2.44??6.08; P &lt;0.001). Sex, region of birth, and study period (1994??1997 versus 1998??2002) were not associated with HCC survival.  The results of these studies show that HBV infection remains a major public health challenge in highly endemic countries such as Vietnam. HBV-related liver disease burden in Vietnam was estimated to increase for at least two decades despite the introduction of a universal infant HBV-vaccination program. Similarly, HBV-related HCC among Australians born in the APR was estimated to continue to increase over the next two decades. Survival for HBV-related HCC even in settings such as Australia continues to be extremely poor. Strategies are required to expand HBV treatment to individuals with chronic HBV infection who are at greatest risk of progression to advanced liver disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis B virus</field><field name="subject">Liver disease burden</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42118</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for modelling spatial proximity</field><field name="creator">Brennan, Jane, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The concept of proximity is an important aspect of human reasoning. Despite the diversity of applications that require proximity measures, the most intuitive notion is that of spatial nearness. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the underpinnings of the notion of nearness, propose suitable formalisations and apply them to the processing of GIS data. More particularly, this work offers a framework for spatial proximity that supports the development of more intuitive tools for users of geographic data processing applications.  Many of the existing spatial reasoning formalisms do not account for proximity at all while others stipulate it by using natural language expressions as symbolic values. Some approaches suggest the association of spatial relations with fuzzy membership grades to be calculated for locations in a map using Euclidean distance. However, distance is not the only factor that influences nearness perception. Hence, previous work suggests that nearness should be defined from a more basic notion of influence area. I argue that this approach is flawed, and that nearness should rather be defined from a new, richer notion of impact area that takes both the nature of an object and the surrounding environment into account. A suitable notion of nearness considers the impact areas of both objects whose degree of nearness is assessed. This is opposed to the common approach of only taking one of both objects, seen as a reference to assess the nearness of the other to it, into consideration.  Cognitive findings are incorporated to make the framework more relevant to the users of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with respect to   their own spatial cognition. GIS users bring a wealth of knowledge about physical space, particularly geographic space, into the processing of GIS data. This is taken into account by introducing the notion of context. Context represents either an expert in the context field or information from the context field as collated by an expert. In order to evaluate and to show the practical implications of the framework, experiments are conducted on a GIS dataset incorporating expert knowledge from the Touristic Road Travel domain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial reasoning</field><field name="subject">Spatial proximity</field><field name="subject">Spatial cognition</field><field name="subject">Artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">Geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">Spatial knowledge representation</field><field name="subject">Spatial information theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43311</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alternative dispute resolution in local government planning in NSW: understanding the gap between rhetoric and practice</field><field name="creator">Rollinson, David Hugh, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) for local government planning and development disputes in New South Wales. Set within broader theoretical concerns around key concepts, this research comprehensively documents, for the first time, how the ADR process of mediation was introduced to NSW councils and then used by their staff and independent ADR practitioners for disputes over development applications and the formation of local planning policies. The thesis also provides a systematic overview of the use of mediation and conciliation for development appeals brought before the Land and Environment Court of NSW (LEC).  In the 1980s there was considerable interest in ADR in Australia. Mediation was in use for community, family and business disputes and by the early 1990s was being suggested for environmental, planning and development matters. Its use was encouraged by government agencies keen to see a reduction in the costs of often   delayed council decisions on development applications. There was also a desire by councils to find a way to reduce the community disharmony that often occurred over large or contentious applications, or when changes to planning policies were proposed. Mediation held great promise in these early years but as this research shows, its take-up has been modest and its use variable. A detailed analysis of the encouragement to use ADR for planning and development disputes before councils and the LEC, together with an examination of policy and survey evidence, uncovers a significant gap between the promotional rhetoric and actual practice. From extensive in-depth interviews with council staff and ADR practitioners and through personal knowledge, it can be seen that the initial enthusiasm for ADR has not continued, with council staff now more commonly seeking to directly negotiate solutions to development disputes. The thesis concludes by considering the likely future for ADR in local government planning and development disputes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">local government</field><field name="subject">alternative dispute resolution</field><field name="subject">town planning</field><field name="subject">mediation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42974</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Poor glycaemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Stone, Monique Lee, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) have suboptimal glycaemic control, increasing the risk of diabetic complications. This thesis explores some of the causes, consequences and therapeutic options for adolescents with T1DM and poor glycaemic control.  Insulin resistance occurs in T1DM and normal puberty and contributes to poor glycaemic control.  The effect of rosiglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, in addition to insulin on the glycaemic control of adolescents with T1DM was tested using a randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial. Treatment with rosiglitazone did not improve HbA1c, however there was a significant reduction in insulin dose and adiponectin, suggesting improved in insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity by euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp varied widely between individuals and there was no consistent pattern with rosiglitazone.  Potential markers of insulin resistance in T1DM were examined. Total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin levels were lower in children and adolescents with T1DM than controls. HMW adiponectin was significantly associated with other markers of insulin resistance, such as insulin dose, body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS), age, pubertal stage and duration of diabetes.  There is increasing evidence that insulin resistance may play a role in T1DM complications. The natural history and risk factors for the development of microalbuminuria was described using a retrospective cohort study of 972 children and adolescents.  Most cases of microalbuminuria were transient. Apart from baseline albumin excretion rate, HbA1c and age at diagnosis, other predictors of subsequently developing persistent microalbuminuria included several markers of insulin resistance (higher cholesterol, BMI-SDS, and insulin dose).  In addition to insulin resistance, there are many other factors that contribute to glycaemic control.  The role of the variability in carbohydrate intake was assessed using questionnaires and food diaries. Although carbohydrate consumption varied by approximately 45grams each day, it had no significant correlation with HbA1c. The impact of socioeconomic status, quality of life and health care delivery is discussed by comparing glycaemic control of children with T1DM in three diabetes centres. A model for the factors associated with poor glycaemic control in adolescents with T1DM is proposed, and the challenges of research and clinical practice in this population are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">type 1 diabetes</field><field name="subject">adolescents</field><field name="subject">glycaemic control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of trauma-related time distortions</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Leah, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current theories of dissociation are deficient, in that diverse symptoms are grouped under one global classification. This thesis used a multi-pronged approach employing clinical and analogue studies to deconstruct one commonly reported peritraumatic dissociative symptom:  time distortion.  Study 1 tested the proposal that time slowing during a traumatic event would be associated with the development and maintenance of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  The findings indicated that peritraumatic time slowing was associated with more severe PTSD symptoms and a threefold increase in the probability of PTSD three months later.  Study 2 examined qualitative aspects of time distortion experience during traumatic events.  The results indicated that time slowing was linked with the anticipation of aversive outcomes of the event.  Study 3 tested the hypothesis that increased arousal would be associated with overestimates of stimuli duration.  The findings indicated that higher levels of arousal were associated with longer time judgments.  Study 4 investigated hyperarousal in a naturalistic setting involving extreme stress in skydivers.  Higher ratings of fear were associated with a tendency to overestimate event duration.  Study 5 investigated hypnotically-induced temperature change and time perception.  The results indicated that highly hypnotisable hypnotised participants overestimated stimuli duration following a warming suggestion.  Studies 6a, 6b, 7 and 8 investigated whether emotional material was perceived differently to non-emotional material.  Studies 6a and 6b demonstrated that the duration of emotionally negative material was overestimated relative to neutral or positive material.  Study 7 examined the combined effect of valence and physiological arousal on time perception.  The results suggested that arousal mediated the effect of valence on time perception.  Study 8 employed clinical and non-clinical samples to investigate time perception for autobiographical memories.  The results indicated that people currently experiencing PTSD indexed greater estimates of trauma memory duration.  Study 9 examined the effect of perception of control on duration estimates.  The results suggested that perceived lack of control over negative stimuli was associated with longer duration estimates.  Together, the findings supported and extended existing models of time perception, and demonstrated that time distortions appear to be influenced by arousal, emotional valence, and avoidance reactions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42150</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of regulatory variation in multiple mouse tissues</field><field name="creator">Cowley, Mark James, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recently, it has been shown that genetic variation that perturbs the regulation of gene expression is widespread in eukaryotic genomes. Regulatory variation (RV) is expected to be an important driver of phenotypic differences, evolutionary change, and susceptibility to complex genetic diseases. Because trans-acting regulators of gene expression control mRNA levels of multiple genes simultaneously, we hypothesise that RV that affects these components will have a shared-influence upon the expression levels of multiple genes. Since genes are regulated in trans by combinations of basal and tissue specific factors, we further hypothesise that RV in these components may have different effects in each tissue.  We used microarrays to identify 755 genes that were affected by RV in at least one of the brain, kidney and liver of two inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and DBA/2J. Just 2% were affected in all three tissues, suggesting that the influence of RV is predominantly tissue specific. To study shared-RV, we measured the expression levels of these 755 genes in the same 3 tissues from a panel of recombinant inbred mice, and identified groups of correlated genes that are putatively under the influence of shared trans-acting RV. Using methods that we developed for studying the effects of RV in multiple tissues, we identified 212 genes that are correlated in all three tissues, which include 10 groups of at least 3 genes.  We developed a novel method called coherency analysis to show that RV consistently affected the expression levels of these groups of genes in different genetic backgrounds. Strikingly, the relative up- or down-regulation of genes in each group was markedly different in the three tissues of the same mouse, suggesting that the influence of RV itself is not tissue specific as previously expected, but that RV can influence genes with differing outcomes in each tissue. These observations are compatible with RV affecting combinations of basal and tissue specific regulatory factors. This is the first cross-tissue investigation into the influence of shared-RV in multiple tissues, which has important implications in humans, where access to the phenotypically relevant tissue may be necessarily limited.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Microarray</field><field name="subject">Bioinformatics</field><field name="subject">Regulatory Variation</field><field name="subject">Gene Expression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41559</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Study of Biomarkers of Protein Oxidative Damage and Aging by Mass Spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Yi, Dong-Hui, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The physiologically important free radicals, nitrogen monoxide and superoxide, can combine to form the reactive intermediate peroxynitrite.  Peroxynitrite can react with proteins and their constituent amino acids, such as tyrosine, resulting in protein peroxidation, oxidation and nitration.  The nitration of proteins, assessed by the analysis of 3-nitrotyrosine, is a proposed index of pathophysiological activity of peroxynitrite. The aim of the work was to investigate the reaction products between peroxynitrite and protein, develop an assay for 3-nitrotyrosine and measure its levels in biological samples. To study the amino acid products arising from the reaction of peroxynitrite and protein, both liquid chromatography (LC) and gas chromatography (GC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS) were adopted.  Approaches to 3-nitrotyrosine assay development were first, to take advantage of the intrinsic sensitivity of electron capture negative ionization GC-MS.  Secondly, to avoid possible artefactual problems associated with the derivatisation step in GC-MS, an assay for 3-nitrotyrosine based on combined LC-MS-MS was developed.  When a selection of peptides was exposed to peroxynitrite under physiological conditions in vitro, the hydrolysis products showed that 3-nitrotyrosine was the major product.  Detectable minor products were 3,5-dinitrotyrosine and DOPA.  The GC-MS assay was found to be fraught with difficulty due to artefactual formation of 3-nitrotyrosine.  In order to quantify and correct for artefact formation, this complication was approached by incorporating a second isotopomer. This method, however, was confounded by large errors that reduced the overall sensitivity.  Either negative or zero levels of endogenous 3-nitrotyrosine were found in tested samples after correction for artefact formation.  The LC-MS-MS assay was then used to analyse 3-nitrotyrosine levels in a range of biological samples, including human plasma from healthy volunteers, synovial fluid samples from arthritis patients and tissue extracts from a mouse model of amyotropic lateral sclerosis.  In contrast to published data, 3-nitrotyrosine levels were found to be below the limit of detection (1 pg/????L, 10 pg o/c) for all samples - a result somewhat consistent with the negative GC-MS data.  It is suggested that the high 3-nitrotyrosine levels previously reported in the literature might reflect artefactual generation of 3-nitrotyrosine and that other approaches to assessing pathophysiological nitration should be sought in future.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteins Oxidation</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Physiological oxidation</field><field name="subject">Biochemical markers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Violence suicide masculinity</field><field name="creator">King, Anthony James, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia has one of the highest suicide rates in the developed world. Epidemiological data indicate that young men (15-25 years of age) make up one of the most vulnerable groups. The print media regularly portray men in this age group as aggressive and violent in various ways (on the sporting field, at war, in their cups, in contests and in leisure, all of which which take on many different forms). This dissertation presents a collection of such images gleaned over a number of years, the purpose of which is to evoke Durkheim's notion of suicidogenic currents that flow through the ??collective consciousness??, finding, according to Durkheim, their clearest expression in suicide rates. Using the notion of ??suicidogenic current?? as a sensitizing concept, this thesis traces the way in which violence weaves its way through social life and influences social relations that may be conducive to suicide.  It will be argued that the images presented ?? arranged, for effect, as photomontages ?? express the celebration of violence as a powerful social trend which runs not only through social activity, but also through hearts and minds of contemporary persons; as such, it constitutes one of the suicide-inducing conditions in contemporary society.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Masculinity</field><field name="subject">Violence</field><field name="subject">Suicide</field><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="subject">Sacrifice</field><field name="subject">Durkheim</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards immunization of complex engineered systems: products, processes and organizations</field><field name="creator">Efatmaneshnik, Mahmoud, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Engineering complex systems and New Product Development (NPD) are major challenges for contemporary engineering design and must be studied at three levels of: Products, Processes and Organizations (PPO). The science of complexity indicates that complex systems share a common characteristic: they are robust yet fragile. Complex and large scale systems are robust in the face of many uncertainties and variations; however, they can collapse, when facing certain conditions. This is so since complex systems embody many subtle, intricate and nonlinear interactions. If formal modelling exercises with available computational approaches are not able to assist designers to arrive at accurate predictions, then how can we immunize our large scale and complex systems against sudden catastrophic collapse? This thesis is an investigation into complex product design. We tackle the issue first by introducing a template and/or design methodology for complex product design. This template is an integrated product design scheme which embodies and combines elements of both design theory and organization theory; in particular distributed (spatial and temporal) problem solving and adaptive team formation are brought together. This design methodology harnesses emergence and innovation through the incorporation of massive amount of numerical simulations which determines the problem structure as well as the solution space characteristics.  Within the context of this design methodology three design methods based on measures of complexity are presented. Complexity measures generally reflect holistic structural characteristics of systems. At the levels of PPO, correspondingly, the Immunity Index (global modal robustness) as an objective function for solutions, the real complexity of decompositions, and the cognitive complexity of a design system are introduced These three measures are helpful in immunizing the complex PPO from chaos and catastrophic failure.  In the end, a conceptual decision support system (DSS) for complex NPD based on the presented design template and the complexity measures is introduced. This support system (IMMUNE) is represented by a Multi Agent Blackboard System, and has the dual characteristic of the distributed problem solving environments and yet reflecting the centralized viewpoint to process monitoring. In other words IMMUNE advocates autonomous problem solving (design) agents that is the necessary attribute of innovative design organizations and/or innovation networks; and at the same time it promotes coherence in the design system that is usually seen in centralized systems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Engineering immunity.</field><field name="subject">Complex systems engineering.</field><field name="subject">Complexity product design.</field><field name="subject">Blackboard data bases.</field><field name="subject">Complexity measures.</field><field name="subject">Multi agent systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43358</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deformation behaviour of diamond-like carbon coatings on silicon substrates</field><field name="creator">Haq, Ayesha Jabeen, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The deformation mechanisms operating in diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings on (100) and (111) Si, has been investigated. The effect of coating thickness, indenter geometry, substrate orientation and deposition technique on the deformation of DLC coatings and the underlying substrate was studied by undertaking nanoindentation followed by subsurface microstructural characterization. Uncoated (111) Si was also investigated for comparison. The observed microstructural features were correlated to the indentation response of the coatings and compared with simulation studies, as well as observations on uncoated Si.  In uncoated (111) Si, phase transformation was found to be responsible for the discontinuities in the load-displacement curves, similar to (100) Si. However, slip was activated on {311} planes instead of on {111} planes. Moreover, the density of defects was also significantly lower and their distribution asymmetric.  The coatings were adherent, uniformly thick and completely amorphous. The load-displacement curves displayed several pop-ins and a pop-out, the indentation loads for the first pop-in and the pop-out depending primarily on the thickness of the coating. The coatings exhibited localized compressive deformation in the direction of loading without any through-thickness cracks. The extent of this localized deformation increased with indentation load. Hardness and thickness of the coatings and the geometry of the indenter influenced the magnitude of compressive strains. Harder and thinner coatings and a blunt indenter exhibited the minimum degree of deformation. Densification by rearrangement of molecules has been suggested as the mechanism responsible for plastic compression.  At indentation loads corresponding to the first pop-in, (100) and (111) silicon substrates initially deformed by &lt;111&gt; and &lt;311&gt; slip respectively. Higher indentation loads caused phase transformation. Therefore, unlike in uncoated Si, dislocation nucleation in the Si substrate has been proposed as the mode responsible for the first pop-in. Subsequent pop-ins were attributed to further deformation by slip and twinning, phase transformation and extensive cracking (median and secondary cracks) of the substrate. The pop-out, however, was ascribed to phase transformation. Extensive deformation in the substrate, parallel to the interface, is attributed to the wider distribution of the stress brought about by the DLC coating. Good correlation was obtained between the nanoindentation response, microstructural features and simulation studies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Diamond-like carbon</field><field name="subject">Nanoindentation</field><field name="subject">Deformation</field><field name="subject">Focussion ion beam microscopy</field><field name="subject">Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Powerplay: video games, subjectivity and culture</field><field name="creator">Tulloch, Rowan Christopher, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines single-player video gaming. It is an analysis of video game play: what it is, how it functions, and what it means. It is an account of how players learn to play. This is done through a set of close readings of significant video games and key academic texts. My focus is on the mechanisms and forces that shape gameplay practices. Building on the existing fields of ludology and media-studies video-game analysis, I outline a model of video game play as a cultural construction which builds upon the player's existing knowledge of real world and fictional objects, scenarios and conventions. I argue that the relationship between the video game player and the software is best understood as embodying a precise configuration of power. I demonstrate that the single-player video game is in fact what Michel Foucault terms a 'disciplinary apparatus'. It functions to shape players' subjectivities in order to have them behave in easily predicted and managed ways. To do this, video games reuse and repurpose conventions from existing media forms and everyday practices. By this mobilisation of familiar elements, which already have established practices of use, and by a careful process of surveillance, examination and the correction of play practices, video games encourage players to take on and perform the logics of the game system. This relationship between organic player and technological game, I suggest, is best understood through the theoretical figure of the 'Cyborg'. It is a point of intersection between human and computer logics. Far from the ludological assumption that play and culture are separate and that play is shaped entirely by rules, I show video game play to be produced by an array of complex cultural and technological forces that act upon the player. My model of video game play differs from others currently in circulation in that it foregrounds the role of culture in play, while not denying the technological specificity of the video gaming apparatus. My central focus on power and the construction of player subjectivities offers a way to move beyond the simplistic reliance on the notion that rules are the primary shaping mechanism of play that has, to date, dominated much of video game studies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer games</field><field name="subject">Video games</field><field name="subject">Ludology</field><field name="subject">Post-structuralism</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Active equity fund management: Benchmarking and trading behaviour</field><field name="creator">Lee, Adrian David, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates key issues concerning how active equity fund managers add value: measuring alpha (Chapter 3), generating alpha (Chapters 4, 5 and 6) and transaction cost minimisation (Chapter 7). Chapter 3 proposes important methodological adjustments to the widely adopted benchmarking methodology of Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman and Wermers (1997). Applying this modified benchmark to a sample of active funds and simulated passive portfolios that mimic fund manager style characteristics, statistically lower tracking error is documented, compared with using the standard methodology. These findings suggest that improved specifications of characteristic benchmarks represent better methods in accurately quantifying fund manager skill. Chapter 4 examines a portfolio strategy which selects stocks using the undisclosed monthly holdings of Australian active funds. When considering a large range of strategies incorporating portfolio holdings information, the top performing strategies are robust to data-snooping and are economically and statistically significant when incorporating transaction costs. Accounting for look-ahead bias in the formation of a strategy, statistically significant alpha of at least 6.88 percent per year is found when following the best performing strategy holding 20 stocks or more in the previous month. Chapter 5 examines the relation of active equity fund managers location proximity to a stock??s corporate headquarter using portfolio holdings data. Contrary to much international research, this study reveals evidence inconsistent with a location advantage for Melbourne and Sydney-based funds. Chapter 6 examines retail investor trading on the Australian Stock Exchange. The performance of retail investors is highly heterogeneous: discount (non-discount) retail brokerage investors lose -0.59 (-0.05) percent intraday and experience negative (positive) returns over the subsequent year. These findings are inconsistent with retail investors exerting price pressure or providing liquidity to institutions. Chapter 7 examines whether equity fund managers use multiple brokers in a trade package in order to lower their price impact and brokerage costs. Using the daily trades of funds, multiple broker trades are not found to have lower costs compared to a single broker, even when controlling for the informativeness of the trade package and potential endogeneity. These findings suggest that fund managers do not lower their costs when using multiple brokers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Individual Investors</field><field name="subject">Funds management</field><field name="subject">Trading costs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43403</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Value added tax in Ethiopia: A study of operating costs and compliance</field><field name="creator">Yesegat, Wollela Abehodie, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the operating costs of, and intentional compliance with, the value added tax (VAT) in Ethiopia. The study focuses on assessing the magnitude and nature of operating costs, identifying areas in the design and administration of the tax that contribute to the operating costs and the problems in the operation of the tax at large, and also on the link between VAT compliance costs and intentional output VAT reporting compliance decisions. The study adopts a mixed methods research approach to test a series of hypotheses and answer research questions that emerge through the review of existing literature and the experiences of the researcher in respect of the Ethiopian tax system. Specifically, the study uses surveys of taxpayers and tax practitioners, experimental design, interviews with tax officials and documentary analysis. The study statistically analyses the data elicited from the surveys and experimental design. It also analyses the results of in-depth interviews with tax officials and examination of documents held by tax authorities and other institutions. The results of this combined research methodology reveal that VAT operating costs in Ethiopia in the fiscal year 2005/06 appear to be relatively low. However, this low level of operating costs may not imply that the VAT system in Ethiopia is simple. In particular, in the case of administrative costs it is argued that it may indicate that the tax authorities are under-resourced which in turn may have affected their ability to accomplish the responsibilities entrusted to them. In respect of compliance costs, although the total costs seem to be low, it is contended that their regressiveness is likely to impact on the equity of the tax system as a whole. Further, the results show that VAT compliance costs and intentional VAT reporting compliance decisions are inversely correlated; but this correlation is statistically weak. The results also identify several concerns in the design and administration of the tax that have bearing on the operating costs and the operation of the tax. Specifically, the existence of the relatively high registration threshold, the high frequency of VAT reporting, the use of the invoice method of accounting (the latter two pertain mainly to small businesses) and weak administration are noted. iv The thesis suggests a series of measures which could be taken by the government and by the tax authorities in particular, to address the various problems identified in the study. These measures include strengthening the administration; allowing small businesses to adopt the cash basis of accounting and report less frequently; and reducing the registration threshold. The use of tax education is also emphasised as a strategy to improve compliance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">compliance</field><field name="subject">Value added tax</field><field name="subject">operating costs</field><field name="subject">Ethiopia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43317</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glial changes in atypical parkinsonian syndromes</field><field name="creator">Song, Yun Ju Christine, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Idiopathic Parkinson??s disease (PD) and the atypical parkinsonian syndromes progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) have substantial overlap in clinical features, with parkinsonian and cerebellar phenotypes identified. Pathologically, reactive glial changes occur in overlapping pathways in these disorders. Recent findings that glia concentrate proteins associated with genetic forms of PD, suggest a more significant role for these cells in the pathogenesis of these disorders. This study is the first to comparatively assess glial abnormalities in PD, PSP and MSA. Cases were clinically and pathologically characterised to establish correlates to prominent glial changes. The three main types of glia (astrocytes, oligodendroglia and microglia) were characterised by morphological features and protein expression (using immunohistochemical techniques) for correlations with disease indices. Tissue features measured included subregional volumes, nigral cell loss, characteristic disease inclusions, and the densities of glia. Using these techniques, the parkin co-regulated gene protein was found to be a novel constituent protein in protoplasmic astrocytes, facilitating the assessment of glial subtypes.  The data show that distinct glial abnormalities associate with each parkinsonian syndrome. The most marked differences were observed in the astrocytic reaction in each disorder. In PD, protoplasmic astrocytes accumulated non-fibrillar &#61537;-synuclein and degenerated over time, relating to a loss of levodopa responsiveness. In PSP, there was a marked protoplasmic astrogliosis (with these reactive glia strongly expressing parkin) that related to PSP-prominent clinical symptoms. In MSA, there was a marked fibrous astrogliosis and a loss of protoplasmic astrocytes in association with early changes in constituent myelin and oligodendroglial proteins. In contrast, similar microglial activation was observed across all disorders, with phagocytes concentrating in the substantia nigra, while non-phagocytic reactive microglia expressed parkin and associated with inclusion formation in each disorder. Overall, the glial reactions were considered to be either contributing to or ameliorating (neuroprotective) the neurodegenerative processes, and the timing of these reactions assessed with respect to indices of disease progression. The novel findings of this thesis show that glial abnormalities are prominent but distinct, and occur early in these parkinsonian syndromes. Suggestions on how these findings may translate into future therapeutic targets are given.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glia</field><field name="subject">parkinsonism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43314</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compact Group Actions and Harmonic Analysis</field><field name="creator">Chung, Kin Hoong, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">A large part of the structure of the objects in the theory of Dooley and Wildberger [Funktsional.

Yet there is little guidance in how collaboration should occur, and little evidence that collaborative care improves patient outcomes. Related models and measures of patient centred care and shared decision making have not been developed specifically for the context of chronic disease care. This thesis aimed to develop a theoretical understanding of how providers and patients make decisions in chronic disease care planning, how patients experience involvement in care planning, and to develop a measure of patient involvement. It consists of two studies: a qualitative study to develop a grounded theory of decision-making in diabetes care planning, and a scale development and psychometrics study. The qualitative study involved 29 providers and 16 patients with diabetes. It found that providers were concerned with a process described as ??managing patient involvement to do the right thing??, while patients were concerned with ??being involved to make sure care is appropriate??. This led to the theory of ??delivering respectful care??, a grounded theory that integrates provider and patient perspectives by showing how providers and patients can resolve their concerns while achieving mutually acceptable outcomes. Central to this theory is the process of finding common ground, while the key conditions are provider responsiveness and an ongoing, trusting and respectful provider-patient relationship.  The Collaborative Care Planning Scale (CCPS), based on these findings, is a patient self-report scale that measures patients?? perceptions of involvement in care planning. After piloting the CCPS was tested amongst 166 patients with diabetes. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in a 27-item scale comprising two factors: ??receiving appropriately personalised care?? and ??feeling actively involved in decision-making??. Psychometrics tests revealed the CCPS has adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and findings support construct validity.  ??Delivering respectful care?? enriches understanding of the nature of collaboration in chronic disease care, and identifies those elements necessary to ensure patients receive best possible care. The CCPS provides the means for measuring what patients say they value, and is thus an important measure of quality chronic disease care.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shared decision-making</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42153</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of architectural knowledge in managerial decision making: an experimental discrete choice evaluation of the adoption of executional strategies</field><field name="creator">Richard, Pierre Jules, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Managers have responsibility for implementing a firm??s executional strategy.  An executional strategy is the selection of resources and capabilities and the arrangement of them into a supply chain that puts a firm??s espoused positioning into action (Porter, 1985). Executional strategies are selected to maximize economic rents. Firm resources (Barney, 1991) and the arrangement of supply chains (Chandler, 1962; 1990) are important to rent generation. In turn, the potential arrangement of activities into a supply chain is determined by a firm??s depth of architectural knowledge; this is knowledge of how supply chain elements can be linked (Henderson and Clark, 1990). The study provides a simultaneous test of the impact of resources and supply chain arrangements on the selection of executional strategies. The theoretical model is tested through a discrete choice experiment (Louviere et al., 2000). Findings suggest that resources and cost advantages dominate management decision-making with competition also an influence. Importantly, findings for a sub-sample of subjects whose firms are most impacted by Information technology (IT), confirms that architectural knowledge does play a role in the selection of executional strategies. These ??engaged?? subjects were significantly more experienced with the subject matter and more confident about their responses. These engaged subjects utilized architectural knowledge to select strategies that leveraged their resources more widely and to minimize the influence of transaction costs on their strategic choices.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Architectural knowledge</field><field name="subject">Strategy</field><field name="subject">Modular systems</field><field name="subject">Discrete choice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal integration of GPS with inertial sensors: Modelling and implementation</field><field name="creator">Ding, Weidong, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Integration of GPS with Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) can provide reliable and complete positioning and geo-referencing parameters including position, velocity and attitude for dynamic platforms for a variety of applications. This research has been focusing on four modelling and implementation issues for a GPS/INS integrated platform in order to improve the overall integration performance, in particular: a) Time synchronization Having recognised that having a precise time synchronisation of measurements is fundamental in constructing a multi-sensor integration platform and is critical for achieving high data fusion performance, various time synchronisation scenarios and solutions have been investigated. A criterion for evaluating synchronisation accuracy and error impacts has been derived; an innovative time synchronisation solution has been proposed; an applicable data logging system has been implemented with off-the-shelf components and tested. b) Noise suppression of INS raw measurements Low cost INS sensors, especially MEMS INS, would normally exhibit much larger measurement noise than conventional INS sensors. A novel method of using vehicle dynamic information for de-noising raw INS sensor measurements has been proposed in this research. Since the vehicle dynamic model has the characteristic of a low pass filter, passing the raw INS sensor measurements through it effectively reduces the high frequency noise component.   c) Adaptive Kalman filtering The present data fusion algorithms, which are mostly based on the Kalman filter, have the stringent requirement on precise a priori knowledge of the system model and noise properties. This research has investigated the utilization issues of online stochastic modelling algorithm, and then proposed a new adaptive process noise scaling algorithm which has shown remarkable capability in autonomously tuning the process noise covariance estimates to the optimal magnitude.  d) Integration of a low cost INS sensor with a standalone GPS receiver To improve the performance where a standalone GPS receiver integrated with a MEMS INS, additional velocity aiding and a new integration structure has been adopted in this research. Field test shows that velocity determination accuracy could reach the centimetre level, and the errors of MEMS INS have been limited to such a level that it can generate stable attitude and heading references under low dynamic conditions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Integration</field><field name="subject">GPS</field><field name="subject">INS</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Relationships among afferent neural processing, peristalsis and bolus clearance in the human oesophagus: implications for symptom perception and dysphagia</field><field name="creator">Chen, Chien-Lin, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the relationships among oesophageal motility, bolus clearance and sensory perception of oesophageal stimuli in patients with several dysphagia syndromes were investigated. The work is divided into the following major sections: 1) Current advances in the application of impedance and its utility in distinguishing clearance characteristics between primary and secondary peristalsis; 2) The advances in our understanding of peristaltic motor characteristics, oesophageal bolus clearance and symptom perception in dysphagia syndromes; 3) Peristaltic dysfunction, impaired bolus clearance and symptom perception in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and in patients with globus; 4) TRPV1 expression in oesophageal mucosa in patients with GORD. The main findings from this work are: 1) Secondary peristalsis is less effective as primary peristalsis regarding esophageal transit and clearance of a liquid bolus. 2) In patients with non-obstructive dysphagia (NOD), bolus clearance by both morphologically normal and aberrant secondary peristaltic sequences is impaired. 3) Although, when compared with healthy controls, patients with NOD have a higher prevalence of non-specifically abnormal motor patterns, there is a poor correlation between dysphagia and oesophageal dysmotility. 4) Whereas manometry identified motility abnormalities in one quarter of patients with GORD, impedance demonstrated that the majority of these patients, as well as some patients with normal manometry, had defective bolus clearance. 5) Although patients with erosive GORD have delayed oesophageal bolus clearance, manometric characteristics in these patients are comparable to those seen in non-erosive reflux disease (NERD). These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that abnormal oesophageal bolus clearance may reflect a continuum of dysfunction secondary to increasing oesophageal mucosal damage. 6) Patients with globus are characterized by oesophageal visceral hypersensitivity and aberrant viscerosomatic referral of mechanical and electrical stimuli to the oesophagus. These findings support the hypothesis that oesophageal hypersensitivity with associated viscerosomatic referral patterns are an important pathogenetic mechanism for globus. 7) Patients with erosive GORD exhibit greater gene expression of TRPV1 in oesophageal mucosa when compared with NERD or healthy controls. These findings support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation may lead to the release of mediators which may modulate function of primary sensory neurons.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary peristalsis</field><field name="subject">Oesophageal bolus clearance</field><field name="subject">Oesophageal afferent prcocessing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on fundamental uncertainty, stock return volatility and earnings management</field><field name="creator">Shan, Yaowen, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of three stand-alone essays on fundamental uncertainty, stock return volatility and earnings management.  The first study investigates the role of information about firms?? fundamentals contained in analysts?? forecasts (which I label ??non-accounting information??) in understanding stock return volatility. When combined with Ohlson??s (1995) linear information dynamics, the accounting version of the Campbell-Shiller model (Campbell and Shiller 1988a, 1988b; Vuolteenaho 2002) implies that if current non-accounting information is more uncertain, then future stock returns are expected to be more volatile. The empirical evidence supports the theoretical predictions, and the results are valid for measures of both systematic and idiosyncratic volatility. Additional analysis yields some evidence that both favourable and unfavourable news from non-accounting information increases future stock return volatility. Overall, the results highlight the value relevance of information in analysts?? forecasts beyond what is contained in the current financial statements.  The second essay extends the theoretical framework of Callen and Segal (2004) and Vuolteenaho (2002) to investigate the association between the uncertainty of accrual information and stock return volatility. The empirical evidence supports the theoretical prediction that the extent of uncertainty in accounting accruals is increasing with the volatility of future stock returns, and the results are valid for measures of both systematic and idiosyncratic volatility. However, when accrual variability is decomposed into fundamental and unexpected portions, I find that the positive relationship between accrual variability and future stock return volatility is dominated by the fundamental component of accrual variability. The findings therefore suggest that the market places little weight on information conveyed by that component of accounting accruals that is most likely to reflect accounting choices, implementation decisions and managerial opportunism.  The final essay argues that the presumed articulation among accruals, cash flows and revenues does not capture decisions on expected accruals when large external financing activities are present. The analysis provides evidence that managers?? ??normal?? operating decisions associated with net external financing activities are likely to lead to measurement errors in unexpected accruals that are part of expected accruals, and erroneous conclusions that significant earnings management exists when in fact there is none. This is especially pertinent in cases where the partitioning variable used to identify instances of earnings management is supposed to be uncorrelated with external financing, when in fact it is correlated. The results underscore the importance of additional specification tests being conducted to control for estimation biases in unexpected accruals associated with external financing. I suggest the use of matched-firm approach using industry and external financing matches in order that reliable and warranted inferences are made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Non-accounting information</field><field name="subject">Stock return volatility</field><field name="subject">Earnings management</field><field name="subject">Accruals</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phase I animal safety study of new second generation porphyrin based photosensitizers in the Syrian Golden hamster</field><field name="creator">Wittmann , Johannes , Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pancreatic cancer kills over 1700 people each year in Australia. In 2000, there were 1908 new cases diagnosed and it remains one of the least treatable malignancies. In the USA, it was the fourth leading cause of cancer death in 2004, with 31,860 new cases and 31,270 recorded deaths. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a novel, potentially useful treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer with only limited research and clinical work addressing this until now. PDT induces non-thermal, cytotoxic and ischaemic injury to a targeted volume of tissue. During PDT, a photosensitizer is activated by non-thermal light in the presence of oxygen, generating cytotoxic oxygen species and inducing cellular injury and microvascular occlusion. The aim of this thesis was to conduct an animal safety study using two second generation photosensitizers, talaporfin sodium and verteporfin, to assess the risks of pancreatic PDT by looking at injury to organs adjacent to the pancreas and assessing recovery from PDT treatment of the pancreas. The Syrian Golden hamster animal model was used to compare the results of this research to previous work by other authors. The study design incorporated a number of additional experiments, including quantitative tissue fluorescence techniques, plasma level analysis and histopathology techniques. The methods for the animal safety study were similar to the approach used in the clinical setting and provided vital data on the likely risks and side effects of phototherapy in humans. The first study, looking at talaporfin sodium, found likely risks of duodenal injury, gastric injury and death with a limited effect on normal pancreas at photosensitizer doses likely to be employed for pancreatic cancer PDT. The second study, using verteporfin, found similar results with a more potent effect on the normal pancreas at studied drug doses. Both agents had short drug-light intervals, ranging from 15 minutes to 2 hours, reducing the need for pre-treatment hospitalization and short photosensitivity periods of about one to two weeks. Some animals suffered minor cutaneous photosensitivity injuries. A human pancreatic cancer PDT pilot study is feasible and the risks and complications should be acceptable.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pancreatic cancer.</field><field name="subject">Talaporfin.</field><field name="subject">Verteporfin.</field><field name="subject">Porphyrins.</field><field name="subject">Hamsters as laboratory animals.</field><field name="subject">Photosensitization, Biological -- Congresses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ratings transitions and total return</field><field name="creator">Arnold, Bruce Robert, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The expected yield to maturity on a defaultable obligation equals the nominal yield less expected default losses.  However, in a mark-to-market world, one doesn't have the luxury of reporting one's performance on the basis of yield to maturity.  Total return is calculated for an arbitrary holding period, and must reflect any mark-to-market gains or losses as at the close of the period-gains or losses that can be triggered by the bond's upgrade or downgrade.  Thus to estimate expected total return, one must estimate not only expected default losses, but also the impact on capital price of expected ratings transitions.  This paper begins with the observation that a bond which is blessed by more favourable transition characteristics is likely to produce a higher total return, and poses the question of how that benefit can be quantified.  How much is it worth?  To answer the question, I start by specifying a formal bond-pricing model reflective of ratings transitions.  I survey various statistical methods and past research efforts to identify the ratings-transition matrix which best parametrises the model, and propose a novel test for selecting between competing matrices.  Using this approach, I replicate several important studies of ratings transitions.  I also use it to examine new published and unpublished data, testing for (and finding) ratings path-dependency, and otherwise exploring the effect of ratings changes on different bond sectors.  I then turn to the question of whether it is possible to estimate bond-specific transition probabilities, and propose a way to do so.  I combine these efforts into the specifications for a pricing model capable of answering the question:  How much is it worth?</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Path dependency</field><field name="subject">Credit risk</field><field name="subject">Credit migration matrix</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mobilising action through management email texts: the negotiation of evaluative stance through choices in discourse and grammar</field><field name="creator">Wee, Constance Wei-Ling, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with explicating the role of language in mobilising action through management emails. Situated within the context of organisational change in a globalised manufacturing business, the project is framed by behavioural observations from management scholars Palmer and Hardy (2000) of mobilisation strategies that utilise linguistic resources since they: (a) involve a sense of obligation or inclination in directives; (b) show how co-operation will produce mutual benefits; (c) construct desired actions as legitimate, beneficial or inevitable; and (d) use past or anticipated meanings, for or against certain actions. Systemic Functional Linguistics is the underlying framework employed to provide a theoretically principled account of the intuitively derived observations from Palmer and Hardy (2000) which are applied to a sample of twenty-seven email texts, through corpus- and text-based analysis. A major finding is that the representation of action is enacted interpersonally through the verbal group. This view complements experientially dominated accounts of the verbal group which focus on the tense system.  Further, action is found to be motivated through the negotiation of evaluative stance. By relating the grammar of the verbal group as well as other resources to the discourse semantics of Appraisal, modulation (of obligation or inclination) is found to be enabled by both negative as well as positive judgements of capacity. Specifically, judgements of capacity are re-interpreted as invocations of high obligation as managers seek to mobilise (further) positive performance. The analysis demonstrates that elements in the verbal group (complex) and Appraisal co-opt action through enabling positioning of the writer, in terms of assessing and grading categorical meanings, manipulating interpersonal time, or foregrounding solidarity. A significant contribution to the thesis is an extension of the system of GRADUATION: FOCUS (Hood, 2004a) through the demonstration of how resources of the verbal group negotiate expectations of appearances and achievements. This study has also extended the resources of GRADUATION: FORCE by applying it to the management context.  The practical contribution of the study is that these insights may more explicitly inform management training and enable managers to participate more effectively within their community of practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systemic functional linguistics</field><field name="subject">Email texts, Palmer and Hardy (2000)</field><field name="subject">Evaluative stance</field><field name="subject">Discourse</field><field name="subject">Grammar</field><field name="subject">Negotiation</field><field name="subject">Appraisal theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The generalized continuous wavelet transform  on Hilbert modules</field><field name="creator">Ariyani, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The construction of the generalized continuous wavelet transform (GCWT) on Hilbert spaces is a special case of the coherent state transform construction, where the coherent state system arises as an orbit of an admissible vector under a strongly continuous unitary representation of a locally compact group.

The National Prescribing Service??s Seniors QUM Program was developed in collaboration with consumers to address seniors?? medicines information needs. Seniors are trained as peer educators to convey QUM messages to other seniors in a single group session.  However, there is a dearth of research assessing peer education for seniors about medicines, and little understanding of what peer educators do in practice.  This research investigated how peer educators empower seniors toward the quality use of their medicines.  A participatory action research inquiry was undertaken nationally with organisational leaders and locally with peer educators.  The design was a nested case study with multiple sites, where the Seniors Program was the overarching case containing eight disparate local sites.  The participatory inquiry engaged peer educators from each local site. Qualitative data were collected through participant observation and interviews.  Data were analysed using grounded theory methods and findings were triangulated with other data sources.  Peer educators demonstrated five main functions in the program ?? one primary function within QUM sessions and four support functions outside of sessions. The primary function of facilitating peer learning comprised 10 elements.  A model depicts these elements in the context of varying session conditions and consequences.  Educators?? lived experience as seniors and lay persons was an overarching contributor to peer learning, used strategically through storytelling to assist other elements.  Sharing QUM outside of sessions occurred frequently, but requires development to reach isolated seniors.  Peer educators exceeded expectations in getting QUM messages to seniors, applying unique skills to the information exchange within sessions.  Their status as lay persons tackling the complex topic of QUM reflected an understanding of the disempowerment seniors may feel when seeking information about medicines. Peer educators?? ability to model an active partner role by applying their lived experience through storytelling in an interactive, mutually sharing session challenged seniors to rethink their medicines management and interactions with health professionals.  As the population ages and medicines use increases, understanding and using seniors effectively as educators has great potential.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">People over 55 years</field><field name="subject">Peer education</field><field name="subject">Quality use of medicines</field><field name="subject">Participatory action research methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling aspects of neurodegeneration in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</field><field name="creator">Traini, Mathew, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The neurodegenerative disorders Alzheimer??s Disease (AD) and Parkinson??s Disease (PD) are characterised by the accumulation of misfolded amyloid beta 1-42 peptide (A&#946;1-42) or &#945;-synuclein, respectively. In both cases, there is extensive evidence to support a central role for these aggregation-prone molecules in the progression of disease pathology. However, the precise mechanisms through which A&#946;1-42 and &#945;-synuclein contribute to neurodegeneration remain unclear. Organismal, cellular and in vitro models are under development to allow elucidation of these mechanisms. A cellular system for the study of intracellular A&#946;1-42 misfolding and localisation was developed, based on expression of an A&#946;1-42-GFP fusion protein in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This system relies on the known inverse relationship between GFP fluorescence, and the propensity to misfold of an N-terminal fusion domain. To discover cellular processes that may affect the misfolding and localisation of intracellular A&#946;1-42, the A&#946;1-42-GFP reporter was transformed into the S. cerevisiae genome deletion mutant collection and screened for fluorescence. 94 deletion mutants exhibited increased A&#946;1-42-GFP fluorescence, indicative of altered A&#946;1-42 misfolding. These mutants were involved in a number of cellular processes with suspected relationships to AD, including the tricarboxylic acid cycle, chromatin remodelling and phospholipid metabolism. Detailed examination of mutants involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis revealed the potential for phospholipid composition to influence the intracellular aggregation and localisation of A&#946;1-42. In addition, an existing S. cerevisiae model of &#945;-synuclein pathobiology was extended to study the effects of compounds that have been hypothesized to be environmental risk factors leading to increased risk of developing PD. Exposure of cells to aluminium, dieldrin and compounds generating reactive oxygen species enhanced the toxicity of &#945;- synuclein expression, supporting suggested roles for these agents in the onset and development of PD. Expression of &#945;-synuclein-GFP in phosphatidylcholine synthesis mutants identified in the A&#946;1-42-GFP fluorescence screen resulted in dramatic alteration of &#945;-synuclein localisation, indicating a common involvement of phospholipid metabolism and composition in modulating the behaviours of these two aggregation-prone proteins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amyloid beta</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="subject">Parkinson's Disease</field><field name="subject">yeast</field><field name="subject">neurodegeneration</field><field name="subject">alpha synuclein</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43383</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of knitting and preforming parameters on mechanical properties of weft knitted glass/epoxy composites</field><field name="creator">Tran, Luu, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Weft knitted composites have a very complex reinforcement structure which affects their mechanical behaviour.

The knitting and performing parameters were varied but the fibre volume fraction was kept constant within the two groups. In all cases the fibre used was E-glass. After knitting, the fabrics were infused with epoxy resin using a resin transfer moulding (RTM) process. The mechanical properties of the cured composites were then determined in the wale direction using the tension test, compression test, flexural test, short beam shear test and Izod impact test.

Harking back to Leibniz in its vision, it imagines a world of interlinked information that computers `understand' and `know' how to process based on its meaning. Spearheaded by the World Wide Web Consortium, ontology languages OWL and RDF form the core of the current technical offerings.  RDF has successfully enabled the construction of virtually unlimited webs of data, whilst OWL gives the ability to express complex relationships between RDF data triples.  However, the formal semantics of these languages limit themselves to that aspect of meaning that can be captured by mechanical inference rules, leaving many open questions as to other aspects of meaning and how they might be made machine processable.  The Semantic Web has faced a number of problems that are addressed by the included publications. Its germination within academia, and logical semantics has seen it struggle to become familiar, accessible and implementable for the general IT population, so an overview of semantic technologies is provided.  Faced with competing `semantic' languages, such as the ISO's Topic Map standards, a method for building ISO-compliant Topic Maps in the OWL DL language has been provided, enabling them to take advantage of the more mature OWL language and tools. Supplementation with rules is needed to deal with many real-world scenarios and this is explored as a practical exercise.  The available syntaxes for OWL have hindered domain experts in ontology building, so a natural language syntax for OWL designed for use by non-logicians is offered and compared with similar offerings.  In recent years, proliferation of ontologies has resulted in far more than are needed in any given domain space, so a mechanism is proposed to facilitate the reuse of existing ontologies by giving contextual information and leveraging social factors to encourage wider adoption of common ontologies and achieve interoperability.  Lastly, the question of meaning is addressed in relation to the need to define one's terms and to ground one's symbols by anchoring them effectively, ultimately providing the foundation for evolving a `Pragmatic Web' of action.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pragmatic web</field><field name="subject">Semantic Web</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Meaning</field><field name="subject">Controlled natural language</field><field name="subject">Topic maps</field><field name="subject">Rule processing</field><field name="subject">Inference</field><field name="subject">Description logic</field><field name="subject">Inference</field><field name="subject">Controlled vocabulary</field><field name="subject">Registry</field><field name="subject">Symbol grounding</field><field name="subject">Semantic technology</field><field name="subject">Semantics</field><field name="subject">Semiotics</field><field name="subject">Data processing</field><field name="subject">Semantic interoperability</field><field name="subject">Cognitive science</field><field name="subject">Definition</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42605</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The two faces of Incan history: Unravelling dual representations in oral traditions of pre-Hispanic Cuzco</field><field name="creator">Yaya, Isabel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the historical traditions and ritual representations of Incan society through the conceptual framework of dual organization. Broadly defined as the division of society into opposed halves, dual organization has been an enduring pattern of social classification in South America. In Pre-Hispanic times, it characterised the social and spatial organization of Cuzco --  the imperial capital of Tawantinsuyu -- which was divided into two asymmetric moieties, Hanan and Urin, composed of several elite factions. Analysis of this system has been hitherto restricted to a branch of ethnohistory informed by structural and cultural anthropology. Very few works have yet investigated the dynamics that linked dualism with the shaping of an historical consciousness proper to the pre-Hispanic ruling elite. The present thesis offers to fill this lacuna in modern scholarship by reassessing Incan narratives in the light of moiety division. In doing so, it identifies the traits proper to two distinctive bodies of Incan traditions, each of which encloses a particular, and mutually conflicting, representation of the past reflecting the moieties' respective perspectives. Such an approach not only harmonizes many discrepancies affecting primary sources on Incan society, but also enables a re-examination of other forms of dualist representation in Incan religion. Three case studies are therefore considered through this methodological approach: the structure of Incan cosmology, the seasonal division of the metropolitan calendar, and the ritual expressions of social antagonisms. The first case study suggests that Incan religion was divided into two sub-cults headed by divinities that were complementary in overseeing water regulation throughout the annual cycle. The second case study shows that the dual division of yearly activities did not coincide sensu stricto with the temporal setting of the Andean meteorological seasons, but rather followed a time framework guided by communal activities and astronomical knowledge. The last case study reveals that the formal model of the conical clan not only clarifies the underlying structure of Incan descent, but also enlightens the triggering mechanisms of Incan succession wars and moiety conflicts. The outcome of this work decolonizes the Andean past by refining our understanding of historical representations in pre-colonial societies.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Incan society.</field><field name="subject">Cultural anthropology.</field><field name="subject">Cuzco.</field><field name="subject">Andean.</field><field name="subject">History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Incremental knowledge acquisition for complex multi-agent environments</field><field name="creator">Finlayson, Angela Margaret, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an incremental knowledge acquisition framework that supports the creation of multi-agent teams in complex real-time environments. The underlying technique is based upon the Ripple Down Rules (RDR) technology. RDR is a knowledge acquisition technology that allows the expert to interact directly with the system and construct knowledge incrementally on a case by case basis. RDR and its variants have been successfully applied to a wide range of problem types. However, there has been no research that has explored the adaptation of RDR to complex real-time, multi-agent environments. The domain chosen to develop our system was the Robocup 2D soccer simulation domain. We investigated an SCRDR approach to the problem and from this developed a more complex system based on generalised RDR. This system supported the incremental modelling of intermediate features during the knowledge acquisition process, allowing the experts to create their own abstractions of the domain. The system was extensively evaluated over a period of 6 months, to evaluate the level of performance of the multi-agent teams created by the system and to gather feedback about the usability of the system. During this period of time the system was successfully used by four soccer coaches with differing levels of soccer and computer expertise. All coaches were able to use the system to develop teams that could play at a world class level against the finalists from the Robocup 2007 2D simulation tournament. The approach we present is general enough to be applied to any complex planning problem, with the requirement that a rich feature language is developed to support the specific domain. Our studies confirm that although GRDR seems to be a useful framework for allowing experts to create their own layers of abstractions, in complex domains, some abstractions need to be expressed in low level code below the knowledge level. Our evaluation also suggests that the GRDR system could be improved via further integration with tools to restructure the KB for complex domains where expertise may be experimental and a more radical reorganisation of the KB is required.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42887</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Eco-spirituality: Collective identity and spirituality in the wilderness action group</field><field name="creator">Apoifis, Nicholas, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">At a peripheral glance the collective action of a social movement group creates a perception of rational and homogenous internal group identity.

The provision of a suitable data format will allow users to take full advantage of the real-time GNSS data distribution system. Types of GNSS supported, message sizes, data rates, data precision levels, hardware and software support and possible future developments are investigated. An analysis is carried out on commonly known GNSS data formats, highlighting the most suitable standard for each evaluation criterion.  A similar investigation is carried out on the transport protocols. An analysis is conducted on various design aspects of NTRIP and RT-IGS protocols, covering factors such as data latency, integrity, &#64257;rewalls and proxy server compatibility and scalability. The analysis also covers the design aspects of the new draft Version 2 of NTRIP. The latter parts of this thesis report on the experiment results aimed at providing assessment of the current level of implementation of NTRIP. Data latency and integrity using NTRIP over the Internet are examined. Their impacts on users applications as the quality of real-time kinematic positioning is assessed. The results show that the performance of the system satis&#64257;es the rigorous requirement of the end-user application. The draft version of the new NTRIP indicates that UDP will be also supported. A similar investigation is carried out, providing the &#64257;rst experiment results on the new option.

However this improvement is not signi&#64257;cant enough to a&#64256;ect the performance of users applications tested.

Vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) are significant contributors to the development and stability of the neointimal lesion. This is due, in part, to their capacity to be phenotypically modulated, facilitating SMC proliferation in response to mechanical injury, their subsequent migration, and deposition of extracellular matrix. The aim of this thesis was to characterize the function of two genes identified in our laboratory to be upregulated shortly after mechanical injury of vascular SMC and their exposure to fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2, an injury-induced cytokine.  The first is activation transcription factor (ATF) 4, which is upregulated by FGF-2 and mechanical injury in vascular SMC in vitro, and by balloon-injury in the artery wall. The induction of ATF4 by FGF-2 was shown to be mediated through the PI3K pathway, and preceded by phoshorylation of eIF2alpha, a known upstream effector of ATF4 activation. Knock-down of ATF4 expression inhibited balloon-injury induced neointimal hyperplasia, suggesting that ATF4 is a key player in the SMC response to injury. Furthermore, microarray analysis identified several genes whose transcription in response to FGF-2 may be regulated by ATF4. In particular, this work demonstrates that ATF4 is necessary for VEGF-A upregulation in SMC in response to FGF-2 and mechanical injury in vitro and in the artery wall following balloon-injury.  The second is a translation factor, YrdC203. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, YrdC203 was found to localize partially to the ER, and with RPL12, a component of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that YrdC203 also interacts with an initiation factor, eIF5B. Mutation of an initiation factor&#146;s signature on the exterior of YrdC203 perturbed its interaction with RPL12 and eIF5B, and inhibited the increase in protein synthesis observed with overexpression of YrdC203. This implicates YrdC203 as a translation factor responsible for ensuring protein synthesis in vascular SMC in response to injury.  The present work provides evidence for new molecular mechanisms, transcriptional and translational, regulating the response of vascular SMC to injury. This would provide leads for future therapeutic targets.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">YrdC</field><field name="subject">vascular smooth muscle cell injury</field><field name="subject">ATF4</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41338</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mitigating predictive uncertainty in hydroclimatic forecasts: impact of uncertain inputs and model structural form</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Shahadat Hossain, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hydrologic and climate models predict variables through a simplification of the underlying complex natural processes. Model development involves minimising predictive uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty arises from three broad sources which are measurement error in observed responses, uncertainty of input variables and model structural error. This thesis introduces ways to improve predictive accuracy of hydroclimatic models by considering input and structural uncertainties. The specific methods developed to reduce the uncertainty because of erroneous inputs and model structural errors are outlined below.  The uncertainty in hydrological model inputs, if ignored, introduces systematic biases in the parameters estimated. This thesis presents a method, known as simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), to ascertain the extent of parameter bias. SIMEX starts by generating a series of alternate inputs by artificially adding white noise in increasing multiples of the known input error variance. The resulting alternate parameter sets allow formulation of an empirical relationship between their values and the level of noise present. SIMEX is based on the theory that the trend in alternate parameters can be extrapolated back to the notional error free zone. The case study relates to erroneous sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) records used as input variables of a linear model to predict the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). SIMEX achieves a reduction in residual errors from the SOI prediction. Besides, a hydrologic application of SIMEX is demonstrated by a synthetic simulation within a three-parameter conceptual rainfall runoff model.  This thesis next advocates reductions of structural uncertainty of any single model by combining multiple alternative model responses. Current approaches for combining hydroclimatic forecasts are generally limited to using combination weights that remain static over time. This research develops a methodology for combining forecasts from multiple models in a dynamic setting as an improvement of over static weight combination. The model responses are mixed on a pair wise basis using mixing weights that vary in time reflecting the persistence of individual model skills. The concept is referred here as the pair wise dynamic weight combination. Two approaches for forecasting the dynamic weights are developed. The first of the two approaches uses a mixture of two basis distributions which are three category ordered logistic regression model and a generalised linear autoregressive model. The second approach uses a modified nearest neighbour approach to forecast the future weights. These alternatives are used to first combine a univariate response forecast, the NINO3.4 SSTA index. This is followed by a similar combination, but for the entire global gridded SSTA forecast field. Results from these applications show significant improvements being achieved due to the dynamic model combination approach. The last application demonstrating the dynamic combination logic, uses the dynamically combined multivariate SSTA forecast field as the basis of developing multi-site flow forecasts in the Namoi River catchment in eastern Australia. To further reduce structural uncertainty in the flow forecasts, three forecast models are formulated and the dynamic combination approach applied again. The study demonstrates that improved SSTA forecast (due to dynamic combination) in turn improves all three flow forecasts, while the dynamic combination of the three flow forecasts results in further improvements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dynamic weight</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Model combination</field><field name="subject">Input error</field><field name="subject">SIMEX</field><field name="subject">Flow forecast</field><field name="subject">Sea surface temperature</field><field name="subject">NINO3.4</field><field name="subject">Mixture regression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Techniques and algorithms for solving the multiobjective path optimisation problem for car navigation</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Ching-Sheng, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conventional information used to guide automobile drivers in selecting their driving routes is the shortest-distance path (SDP). As several researchers have pointed out, driver route selection is a multiple criteria decision process. This research proposes a multiobjective path optimisation (MOPO) decision model to make a more precise simulation of the decision-making behaviour of driver route selection. Seven single-objective path optimisation (SOPO) decision models are taken into account to establish the MOPO decision model. They relate to travel time, travel cost, cumulative distance, roadway capacity, roadway grade, passed intersections and number of turns.  To solve the MOPO problem, a two-stage technique which incorporates shortest path (SP) algorithms and techniques for solving the multiobjective programming problem and a path genetic algorithm (PGA) are proposed. In addition, algorithms such as Dijkstra, A* and GA are reviewed and algorithms that are applicable for solving the MOPO problems are suggested. Furthermore, new algorithms for solving least-node path (LNP) problem, corresponding to the objective of passed intersections, as well as minimum-turn path (MTP) problem, corresponding to the objective of number of turns, are developed.  To conduct the empirical study, a software tool - the multiobjective path optimisation analysis tool (MOPOAT) - was implemented. It contains tools for constructing a road network and its corresponding network topology, the environment of coding techniques for solving the MOPO problems and tools for the manipulation, statistics, analysis and display of experimental results. The purpose of implementing the MOPOAT software is to provide more efficient, convenient and user-friendly tools for solving MOPO and SOPO problems so that an empirical study of real road networks can be carried out more easily.  To demonstrate the advantages of the proposed model in supporting more diverse information to drivers to assist in route selection, several experiments were conducted utilising three real road networks with different roadway types and numbers of nodes and links. Techniques and algorithms such as the two-stage approach, Dijkstra and the PGA for solving the MOPO problem, and the Dijkstra, LNP and MTP algorithms for solving the SOPO problems were applied.  Finally, to deal with improvements in computational efficiency for identifying SPs in a large road network and for population initialisation of the PGA, the critical-section (CS) approach and the seed-path expansion (SPE) approach are proposed. To compare the run time between the conventional SP and CS algorithms as well as the PGA and the SPE algorithms, tools were implemented with commercial GIS, and experimental tests were conducted using road networks with a large amount of nodes and links and different roadway types.  Through these theoretical and empirical studies, several useful contributions and conclusions were obtained.  Some of the most significant findings are:  1.	The experimental results demonstrate the advantages of integration with commercial GIS packages in supporting both spatial and attribute data displays. It can be safely said that, assisted by the MOPOAT software, it is easy for automobile drivers to obtain the optimal paths of the SDP, LNP, MTP and MOPO problems in seconds, despite these problems being highly complex and difficult to resolve manually. 2.	According to the experimental results, the proposed LNP, MTP and MOPO decision models give automobile drivers richer information for choosing their driving routes in a more diverse way. 3.	It is shown by the experimental results that the SDP and LNP mostly locate different paths in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks, and that the total passed intersections by the SDP are greater than passed by the LNP. Moreover, it is revealed that ambiguous turns might occur in both radial-circumferential and grid-type road networks. 4.	It is found that the number of nodes of the SDP is in general greater than the number of nodes of the LNP and MTP irrespective of the type of road network. 5.	A sensitivity analysis for weights shows that as the weighting value of the SDP objective incrementally increases by 0.1 units, the corresponding SDP??s objective value varies either low or high. The same results also occur for the LNP and MTP objectives. This verifies the fact that the weighting coefficients do not reflect proportionally the relative importance of the objectives. Moreover, the MTP objective has the higher sensitivity in comparison with the other two objectives. 6.	Despite utilising Dijkstra or PGA algorithms for solving the MOPO problem, the LNP and MTP algorithms have to be employed to solve the non-commeasurable problem, whereby the standardisation objective value can be obtained. In addition, without any assisting information the PGA might fail to reach the best-compromise solution. 7.	It is found that the total run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the Dijkstra algorithm is much faster than by the PGA. However, if the run time excludes the time needed for population initialisation, the PGA is much faster than the Dijkstra algorithm. 8.	Based on calculated bottlenecks, the proposed CS approach partitions a SP into many critical sections in advance, with the result that a long SP can be obtained by combining all SPs of all CSs. The experimental results show that the run time of the CS algorithm is much faster than Dijkstra??s algorithm. Moreover, the test result for the P-pointer indicates that if the total number of nodes of a SP grows the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm becomes significantly better than the Dijkstra algorithm, and that the CS approach has the best performance. 9.	The experimental result for the E-pointer reveals that the computational efficiency of the CS algorithm will decrease gradually as the number of selected CSs increases. Therefore, the total percentage of selected CSs suggested by the experimental result is no more than 30 percent. 10.	According to the experimental results, the performance order among SDP, LNP and MTP algorithms from fast to slow is SDP, MTP and LNP, and the LNP algorithm requires much more time than the other two algorithms. 11.	As the total nodes of a path increase, most of the run time for SDP and LNP also increases. However, there are still some paths that violate the above rule. This result verifies that the run time needed for solving SDP and LNP is not only affected by the node numbers but also depends on the network topology. 12.	Run time for solving the MOPO problem by applying the PGA is faster than applying the Dijkstra algorithm, if the run time of the former algorithm does not take into account the population initialisation time. Nevertheless, if the run time of the former algorithm does take into account the population initialisation time, the latter algorithm is much faster than the former algorithm. 13.	In comparing the run time for population initialisation, the run time of the evolution process by applying the PGA is quite small, and the bottleneck of the run time for solving MOPO problem by applying the PGA is the population initialisation. 14.	The population initialisation time is reduced significantly by applying the SPE algorithm, and increases at a very slow rate as the number of nodes of a path increases. As the total nodes of a path grow ever larger, the computing time is reduced more noticeably.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multiobjective path optimisation problem</field><field name="subject">Car navigation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sydney's caravan parks:  Community and closure</field><field name="creator">Wedgwood, Kate, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although typically associated with the provision of low-cost holiday accommodation, for over 30 years city-based caravan parks have provided an unrecognised source of permanent housing to the lower end of the market.  Due to their often dilapidated condition and the demographic profile of their residents, caravan parks do not fit within the Australian housing ideal and are often considered enclaves of despondency. Residents are subject to harsh stereotypes and are often referred to as ??trailer trash?? ?? a tag which originated in the USA. However the reality is that caravan parks provide significant social benefits and are unique living environments for their permanent residents. This research involved an extensive discourse analysis complemented by in-depth interviews with caravan park residents and industry stakeholders, which found that the residential experience is typically based on solidarity, companionship, pride and a true sense of belonging.  As urban land prices in Australia have increased exponentially and the footprints of its capital cities continue to grow, large parcels of under-developed land accommodating caravan parks have become ??land banks?? ripe for redevelopment. While it is the park owner??s prerogative to maximise profit, individuals and households are being displaced with little or no compensation, to make way for more lucrative land uses. With deficiencies in the public housing system and the failure of the housing market to provide an adequate level of low-cost accommodation, caravan park residents face an uncertain future, even homelessness. However, the understated impact of this trend is the social implications which affect some of the community??s most vulnerable members. The loss of home, community disintegration and feelings of insecurity appear to be disregarded in the planning process, and this trend seems certain to continue with a lack of responsibility and strategic vision by the government. For this reason, the continued closure of Sydney??s caravan parks should not be tolerated for the purpose of land profiteering. A comprehensive all-of-government and industry response is urgently required to address the threats to Sydney??s caravan parks and to develop mitigation strategies aimed at reducing the resultant outcomes for their vulnerable residents.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Low-cost housing</field><field name="subject">Caravan parks</field><field name="subject">Mobile homes</field><field name="subject">Social impacts of development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic and environmental risk factors for Parkinson's disease in Chinese and Australians</field><field name="creator">Chan, Daniel Kam Yin, School of Physiology &amp; Pharmacology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to study the environmental and genetic factors for Parkinson???s disease (PD) in Chinese and Australian. Using a case-control method, environmental factors for PD were studied in a Chinese population (n=528) in Hong Kong. Current smoking (OR=0.437; p=0.013) and infrequent tea drinking (OR=1.51; p=0.02) were found to be protective factors, whereas family history and pesticide exposure during farming in females were found to be risk factors in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, current smoking reached borderline significance at the 5% level and the variables, years exposed to pesticides and family history were significant at the 10% level. Similarly, a case-control study involving 534 subjects was conducted in Australia. A positive family history was the strongest risk factor (OR=3.4; p&amp;lt0.001). In addition, rural residency was found to be another risk factor (OR=1.8; p&amp;lt0.001). Hypertension, stroke and well water ingestion were inversely correlated with PD (OR=0.2; p&amp;lt0.001, OR=0.2; p&amp;lt0.001 and OR=0.7; p&amp;lt0.03 respectively). When genetic factors were examined in the Chinese population, no association to PD were found for the polymorphisms of the following candidate genes: CYP-2D6 debrisoquine hydroxyalse gene, dopamine transporter gene and monamine oxidase B (MAOB) gene. Furthermore, the Ala53Thr and Ala30Pro mutations of the alpha-synuclein gene were not found amongst this large Chinese population, indicating that variations of this gene are probably rare in Chinese. When candidate genes were studied amongst Caucasian Australians, the poor metaboliser genotype of CYP-2D6 was found to be weaky associated with PD (OR=1.36) in a meta-analysis. The length of the GT repeat alleles of MAOB gene were found to be significantly associated with PD (&amp;gt188 base pair and 186 base pair) while angiotensin converting enzyme gene polymorphism was not found to be associated with PD.  A pilot study was then conducted in Randwick, New South Wales to find out the latest prevalence of PD as well as putative risk factors in a random population. A validation study was carried out for a screening tool (questionnaire) for PD, which was then used for the main study. A total of 730 subjects were involved (527 in the community and 203 in institutions). The survey found that PD prevalence was between 3.6% and 4.9% (higher in aged care facilities). The putative risk factors positively identified were ???family history???(p&amp;lt0.01) and ???exposure to chemicals at work or in surrounding environment??? (p&amp;lt0.05). The age adjusted prevalence rate of PD revealed at least 42.5 % increase in the disease compared to 1966. We conclude that there may be an increase in the disease in Australia due to aging and other risk factors.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Parkinsons disease</field><field name="subject">Genetic aspects</field><field name="subject">Etiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transplantation of nasal olfactory tissues into transected spinal cord of adult rats</field><field name="creator">Lu, Jike, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transplants of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) from olfactory bulbs have recently been shown to support regrowth and reinnervation of damaged spinal cord, which has led to improved functional recovery. Using complete transection in adult rat, the studies presented in this thesis examine the role of peripherally derived olfactory tissue in promoting axonal regeneration and functional recovery. Chapter One and Two provide the background to the area of spinal cord regeneration and the methods used in this thesis. Chapter Three shows that transplants of OECs from rat olfactory lamina propria (OLP) are able to support axon regrowth in the lesioned spinal cord. The BBB score was significantly higher in experimental rats (5.4???0.84) compared with control animals (1.9???0.33) (P&amp;lt0.001). These dissociated OECs from OLP can promote axonal regrowth through the lesion. Histological assessment showed that: 1) axons labelled with Fluororuby grew into the injury site in OECs-transplanted rats, with occasional fibres extending into the rostral cord; 2) brainstem neurons in the raphe nucleus were retrogradely labeled with Fluororuby; and 3) serotonergic axons were detectable distal to the lesion in OECs-transplanted rats. No fibres grew into the injured region and no retrograde labeling or serotonergic fibres were seen in control animals. The role of regenerated serotonergic fibres in OECs-transplanted rats is discussed. Chapter Four demonstrates that solid pieces of OLP dissected from the nose can re-establish the continuity of the transected cord and supply the OECs that can migrate to the cord stumps to support the axon regeneration. Experimental rats which received OLP from olfactory mucosa showed significantly greater locomotive recovery (BBB scores: OLP, 5.0???1.9; control, 1.5???0.5, p&amp;lt0.0001). In animals with OLP transplants, histological analysis indicated that nerve fibres, expressing neurofilament and serotonin were present at the transection site. Locomotive recovery of the hindlimbs occurred,  similar to that seen after OECs transplantation. Retrograde labeling of medullary raphe neurons and gigantocellular reticular nucleus occurred following Fluororuby injection in the cord distal to the lesion, further supporting the supraspinal origin of the 5-HT innervation in the present studies. These results indicate that OLP is effective in promoting partial spinal cord repair. Chapter Five examines functional recovery of spinal reflex circuitry, ie., H-reflex excitability using paired stimuli, in OLP-transplanted rats compared with normal and respiratory lamina propria (RLP) transplanted animals. H-reflex amplitude of the conditioned response was significantly reduced in OLP transplanted rats compared to RLP transplanted animals (p&amp;lt 0.05). Therefore, hindlimb reflex excitability can be modulated by OLP transplants after transection of the spinal cord in adult rats. Chapter Six examines whether functional recovery can occur if transplantation of OLP tissue is delayed by 1 month after the spinal cord transection. The BBB score was significantly higher in experimental rats (4.3???0.8 for OLP) compared with control animals (1.0???0.3, P&amp;lt 0.001), but recovery was less than after acute transplantation. Asx before, histological assessment of OLP animals showed: a) serotonergic axons were present in the cord below the transection site; b) brainstem raphe nuclei was retrogradely labeled; c) bisbenzimide pre-labeled cells from OLP transplants migrated in host spinal cord. These changes were not seen in control animals. These results indicate that OLP has the ability to promote axonal regeneration in chronically injured cord of adult rats. Chapter Seven compares the results from these three types of intervention. In conclusion, these studies show that peripherally derived OECs or solid pieces of OLP can promote partial spinal cord repair in acute or chronic transection injuries. Such tissue might provide a potential source for autologous grafting in human paraplegia.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nasal olfactory tissues</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord</field><field name="subject">Rats</field><field name="subject">Olfactory tissue</field><field name="subject">Transplantation</field><field name="subject">Regeneration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How the bananas got their pyjamas: A study of the metamorphosis of preschoolers' spontaneous singing as viewed through Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development</field><field name="creator">Whiteman, Peter John, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Throughout childhood, children experience the social semiotic of music in a variety of ways.  As they sing, dance, move, and play, they enjoy making and listening to music.  Childhood is also a time of immense change.  During their early years, children grow and develop at a faster rate than at any other time in their lives, displaying an intense proliferation of ways of knowing about the world.  As part of the industrious activity that accompanies this explosion of knowledge, children sing many songs.  It is through sensitive investigation of these songs that we can begin to understand what children know about music, and the place that it is afforded in the social milieux within which they participate. Children???s songs have been the focus of investigation for a number of years, with a range of studies reporting on the manner in which they reflect musical development.  Several researchers have reported on children???s songs from a developmental perspective, while others have focussed on the social and functional contexts of the songs. These various approaches have established some basic principles concerning the development of children???s musical skills and knowledge.  It is accepted that as children mature, they are likely to exhibit changes in their musical understanding and abilities.  However, the diverse range of inquiries that have been undertaken, although rigorous, have resulted in fragmented and irresolute information about the manner in which these changes take place. Research into all areas of children???s development has recently undergone a paradigm shift, with current views focussing on the agency of children and their development within a social context.  Such perspectives view the acquisition of knowledge as a dynamic process that occurs as children interact with others, and therefore place great importance on a range of environments in which this knowledge gain takes place. This thesis reports on a 3-year longitudinal study of eight preschool-aged children who were attending a long day care centre in Sydney.  Regular video-recordings were made of the children???s spontaneous singing during free play, with each child recorded approximately once per month.  Camera tapes were examined and all examples of the participants??? singing were transferred to VHS tapes for transcription and analysis.  The resulting 443 songs were transcribed using Western notation, and each play episode and associated song then coded for musical aspects such as song type, melodic range and level of temporal organisation, as well as social aspects such as song function and social roles taken on by the children.  The notion of social role was informed by Vygotsky???s Zone of Proximal Development.  In addition to base data such as the child???s name and the date of the observation, the resultant dataset was transferred to a qualitative software package (NUD???IST) for subsequent analysis and interpretation. Results of the study indicate that the children used songs for specific purposes, and that patterns of musical development were distinctly different for each child.  While interacting with their playmates, the children used both explicit and implicit tools to acquire and transmit musical signs.  During this process, the status of knowledgeable other was often conferred on a playmate by a less knowledgeable member of the group, and was not solely dependent on chronological age.  The results exhibit some congruence with prior studies, especially those for which the social context of music-making was an important consideration.  The findings expand previous developmentally-based investigations by showing that conceptions based on a unidirectional model of musical development, closely linked to chronological age, need to be refined to consider the diversity of social contexts and generative processes within which children???s musical cultures can be defined. The current study supports a modular conception of musical development allied with recent social reconstructions of childhood.  Some substantiation of previously reported Western musical universals was found in the children???s production of a specific form of chant, and their ability to operate within meaningful musical units such as phrases. The thesis includes a discussion of practical and theoretical implications that arise from the findings.  Several implications for the classroom are offered.  Among the most important are that children???s musical constructions should be utilised as important components of planned teaching and learning experiences, because they are capable of producing sophisticated music if afforded the opportunity to do so.  Careful observation of existing musical knowledge and its incorporation in teachers??? programming will facilitate an efficient and appropriate mode of teaching and learning, based on the needs and interests of the children.  As the children were able to scaffold each other in the process of transmitting and acquiring musical knowledge, it appears advantageous to group them in mixed ages for at least some part of the week.  However, without some intervention on the part of the teacher, it seems that they would likely rely on a fairly restricted collection of scaffolding behaviours.  Additional research is recommended to determine the value of a number of strategies that can be used to meet the musical needs of preschool-aged children beyond the current research site.  Indeed, the outcomes of the study question the importance of striving for a unidirectional model of musical development, immersed in the veil of teleology, and suggest that further research be undertaken in the area of children???s songs, which acknowledges the social agency of children, and their roles in their own musical cultures.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">early childhood</field><field name="subject">music education</field><field name="subject">spontaneous singing</field><field name="subject">Vygotsky</field><field name="subject">Vygotskii</field><field name="subject">preschool children</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">music</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">History as Discourse: Construals of Time, Cause and Appraisal</field><field name="creator">Coffin, Caroline, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with making explicit the role that language plays in apprenticing social subjects into different social or 'discourse' communities. It focuses specifically on the textual and rhetorical strategies of school history texts written by students, aiming to bring a close linguistic analysis of the texts into relationship with the wider social and cultural context. In particular it focuses on three semantic domains. These are Cause, Time and an area of interpersonal evaluation known as Appraisal.  The main questions addressed are ???How do the semantic motifs of Cause, Time and Appraisal function within the discourse of school history? How are they grammatically and lexically realised? What are the semantic and grammatical shifts and interactions that occur as a result of students moving through the different levels of their apprenticeship? In order to answer these questions the analytical tools of systemic-functional grammar are applied to a corpus of texts produced within the context of Australian secondary schooling. These texts represent the range of written genres that history students need to produce in order to fulfil the objectives and outcomes of the history curriculum. A major feature of the research is the use of Appraisal theory, a framework recently developed in systemic-functional linguistics, for analysing the linguistic resources used to negotiate emotions, judgements and social valuations. This theory proves valuable in taking us beyond more traditional linguistic concerns with interpersonal meaning, which focus on modality and mood structure. The main findings of the linguistic analysis show that construals of Cause, Time and Appraisal are core linguistic tools both for interpreting the past and for persuading audiences of the validity of such interpretations. Analysis also reveals that induction into the (discourse) community of historians can be generally characterised as a process of the student expanding their repertoire of metaphorical and specialised language resources as they move from recording the past to arguing about the past.  By providing a fine grained linguistic analysis of the different types of texts that make up school history writing, the research is able to provide insights into the apprenticeship process and into the function and role of history both within and beyond the school context. The major conclusion reached here is that history inducts students into an abstract world of grammatical metaphor and in so doing provides them with the linguistic means to talk about people and time as abstract entities. It also provides them with the positioning and persuading strategies (the ???intellectual flexibility???) necessary for social positions of responsibility.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Historiography</field><field name="subject">Discourse analysis</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Secondary level</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental disorder amongst people of Vietnamese background: prevalence, trauma and culture</field><field name="creator">Steel, Zachary, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The role that culture and trauma plays in shaping mental health outcomes continues to dominate debate in the field of transcultural and post-conflict mental health. The broad aim of this thesis is to investigate key issues relevant to these two factors in relation to the Vietnamese. A meta-analysis of international epidemiological research indicated that countries of North and South East Asia appear to manifest low rates of mental disorder compared to English-speaking countries. A meta-regression analysis of research undertaken specifically with refugee and conflict-affected populations, confirmed a robust association between torture and general trauma and risk to mental disorder. 	The thesis then examines data from three population-based mental health surveys: 1,161 Vietnamese-Australian residents in the state of New South Wales; 3,039 Vietnamese resident in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam; and 7,961 Australian-born persons drawn from a national survey. All surveys applied the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, with the Vietnamese surveys also applying the Phan Vietnamese Psychiatric Rating Scale, an indigenously-derived measure of mental disorder.  The ICD-10 classification system yielded lowest rates amongst Vietnamese in the Mekong Delta, intermediate amongst Vietnamese in NSW; and highest rates amongst the Australian-born population. The Phan Vietnamese Psychiatric Rating Scale added a substantial number of cases in both Vietnamese samples. The findings suggest that sole reliance on a western-derived measure of mental disorder may fail to identify a cases of mental disorder across cultures. Trauma remained a substantial risk factor for mental disorder amongst Australian Vietnamese accounting for a substantial portion of the total burden of mental disorder in that population. The implications of these findings in developing a more refined model for understanding the mental health consequences of mass trauma across cultures are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mental Disorder</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese</field><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Psychiatric Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">mental health</field><field name="subject">Vietnamese -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40888</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The applications of multi-component nucleic acid enzymes (MNAzymes)</field><field name="creator">Suwandi, Ronald, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The emergence of MNAzymes (Multi-component nucleic acid enzymes) provides a new approach for detection of target analytes in various applications. In this thesis, three novel MNAzyme-based methodologies were developed to expand the range of the applications of MNAzymes. MNAzymes can be coupled with DNA or RNA ligands called aptamers to generate an apta-MNAzyme system, which can be used for the detection of non-nucleic target analytes such as small molecules and proteins. Direct detection using apta-MNAzyme system is performed in a format, which was isothermal, fluorescent, rapid, and requires no protein enzymes. Apta-MNAzymes can be coupled with a signal amplification cascade to increase the sensitivity of the reaction.  Another MNAzyme-based methodology termed truncated MNAzyme arm system was developed to discriminate the presence of a single base mismatch of two closely related sequences. The system employs a partzyme with a truncated sensor arm and a stabiliser oligonucleotide that binds adjacently to the truncated sensor arm to stabilise the active MNAzyme structure. Truncated MNAzyme real-time PCR system is capable of discriminating the presence of a single base mismatch in a target DNA with high specificity and sensitivity (down to approximately 10 gene copies).  The generic nature of the system enables simultaneous detection of three SNP targets in a multiplex format. MNAzymes was also investigated with various strategies to discriminate DNA sequences that are either methylated or unmethylated. In this thesis, bisulphite-treated DNA samples present in as low as 0.032 % of methylated DNA in a background of unmethylated DNA were discriminated using MNAzyme real-time methylation specific PCR (MSP) system. Furthermore, the presence of 5-methylcytosines in a target sequence increases the melting temperature of the duplex DNA. This was exploited further to directly discriminate DNA methylation status of target sequences using the truncated MNAzyme arm system without the need for bisulphite modification.  Findings in this thesis have broadened the scope of MNAzymes as versatile tools for many possible applications and flexible alternative to the current technologies.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aptamers.</field><field name="subject">MNAzymes.</field><field name="subject">DNAzymes.</field><field name="subject">SNP.</field><field name="subject">Real-time PCR.</field><field name="subject">Methylation.</field><field name="subject">Nucleic acids.</field><field name="subject">Enzymes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Griffin??s capitol: it??s place in the design of Canberra and the connection with the ideas of Louis Sullivan</field><field name="creator">Willett, Rosemarie Elizabeth, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that Walter Burley Griffin's Capitol as a place of popular congregation on a prominent city site had a critical place in his design for Australia's Federal Capital It offers an intensive and critical reflection on the nature, origin and cultural implications of the Capitol in the context of Canberra's subsequent planning and development. The Capitol represented the essential idea from which he constructed an organic design, integrated with the site conditions and following Sullivan's famous dictum Form follows function. It signified organic democracy, 'a grass roots view' which Griffin shared with Sullivan, rather than the 'top down view' of the mandated power of Government. In order to provide an understanding of how these principles informed Griffin's design, Sullivan's and Griffin's published and unpublished writings are critically reviewed for evidence of the convergence of ideas and agreement on fundamental principles. Resonance with these principles was found in the Competition Drawings and the Original Report entered in the Competition by Griffin. The analysis also drew upon an extensive critical review of sources such as Marion Mahony Griffin's Magic of America, parliamentary papers, archival records, personal papers, and the published literature of Australian and American scholars on Sullivan and Griffin. Sources pertaining to historical movements in architecture and town planning and narratives on architecture for government also formed part of this critical review. The conclusion is that when the desires of the Commonwealth Government were focused by its chief architect on Griffin's Capitol site as the place which should be occupied by Parliament House, the nadir was reached for Griffin's original concept. The vision supplanted, the unravelling of Griffin's organic city plan, with its connections with the ideas of Louis Sullivan, began. Other ideologies began to be introduced with other relationships of form and function, and cost to the organism which was Griffin's city .</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Griffin's Capitol</field><field name="subject">Sullivan connection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43380</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern as process: an aesthetic exploration of the digital possibilities for conventional, physical lace patterns</field><field name="creator">Kenning, Gail Joy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pattern is a familiar concept ever present in our daily lives, existing in many material forms, observable in varied states, and able to be created from a diverse range of processes and events. Natural pattern forms, such as biological and chemical patterns, have been extensively studied, often within the digital environment because of its capacity to process large amounts of data which aids investigation of not only their characteristics but their potentiality. However, human designed physical patterns, while having been investigated extensively in terms of their historical, geographic and cultural significance and their aesthetic and/or mathematical characteristics, have not been fully investigated in terms of their evolutionary potential.  This project explores one example of human designed physical patterns, crochet lace patterns ??? which have remained largely stable and consistent throughout various technological transformations such as the industrial revolution ??? in order to explore pattern as a process and investigate the potential for these patterns to become emergent. This exploration translated the patterns into the digital environment where, as data, the patterns become available for manipulation using a generative art practice approach. By translating the patterns into a digital environment and engaging with the pattern forms at their systematic core, where crochet pattern instructions and software programming scripts operate similarly as ???code???, this research provided a deeper understanding of the patterns and allowed exploration of whether a pattern???s developmental path can be altered to create new emergent patterns. This research draws on systems theory and systems aesthetics and their application within contemporary generative art practice and informs visual arts in several areas including showing how aesthetic values shift as work becomes cross-disciplinary and enters the digital environment, and how the introduction and location of innovation affects the relationship between the original and its copy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Digital media.</field><field name="subject">Art.</field><field name="subject">Craft.</field><field name="subject">New media.</field><field name="subject">Aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Lace and lace making.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface Properties Influencing the Fracture Toughness of Aluminium-Epoxy Joints</field><field name="creator">Rider, Andrew, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis systematically investigates the properties of the aluminium adherend which influence the fracture toughness of aluminium-epoxy adhesive joints in humid environments. The fracture energy of the adhesive joint exposed to a humid environment in comparison with the fracture energy in a dry environment provides a measure of the joint durability. A 500C and 95% relative humidity environment is used to simulate aging of an adhesive joint over several years under normal service conditions.  Initially, surface roughness is found to have a significant influence on the fracture toughness of the adhesive joint in humid conditions. A direct correlation between the bond durability and the angle of deliberately machined micro-roughness in the aluminium surface is determined. Consequently a model is developed which initially has the capacity to describe the bond durability performance. The preparation of aluminium surfaces involves the use of a novel ultramilling tool to produce well defined and controlled surface topography. This work represents the first time surface angles of features in the 1????m to 10????m range have been systematically varied and a direct relationship with bond durability has been determined. The use of surface analytical tools aids in elucidating mechanisms involved in the failure of the adhesive joint and contributes to the development of the stress based diffusion model.  Examination of the aluminium oxide hydration level reveals this property has a negligible effect on the fracture toughness of the aluminium-epoxy joints exposed to humid environments. This information confirms the dominant role of the physical properties of the aluminium surface in determining the adhesive joint durability. This is the first occasion that planer oxide films grown in an RF plasma have had their hydration state adjusted in a controlled manner and their properties subsequently assessed in terms of bond durability properties.  Further alteration of the aluminium surface chemistry is achieved through the application of an organo-silane coupling agent and a series of novel organo-phosphonate compounds. This work further develops the stress based diffusion model developed in conjunction with the micro-machining studies. The components of surface roughness and the ability of interfacial bonds to co-operatively share load are essential for the maintenance of fracture toughness of adhesive joints exposed to humid conditions. The ability of the silane coupling agent to share load through a chemically cross-linked film is a significant property which provides the superior fracture toughness in comparison with the phosphonate treated joints. Although the organo-phosphonate treated aluminium provides hydrolytically more stable bonds than the silane coupling agent, the film is not cross-linked via primary chemical bonds and the reduced load sharing capacity of interfacial bonds increases the bond degradation rate.  The stress based diffusion model evolving from the initial work in the thesis can be used to predict the performance of more complex systems based on a thorough characterisation of the aluminium surface chemistry and topography. The stress based diffusion model essentially describes the concept of the production of micro-cavities at the epoxy-aluminium interface under mode 1 load, as a result of the distribution of strong and weak adhesive bonds. Alternatively, micro-cavities may result from an inhomogeneous stress distribution. In areas where the adhesive bonds are weak, or the local stresses are high, the interfacial load produces larger micro-cavities which provide a path of low resistance for water to diffuse along the bond-line. The water then degrades the adhesive bond either through the displacement of interfacial epoxy bonds or the hydration of the oxide to form a weak barrier layer through which fracture can occur. Alternatively, the water can hydrolyse the adhesive in the interfacial region, leading to cohesive failure of the epoxy resin.  The bond durability performance of a series of complex hydrated oxide films used to pre-treat the aluminium adherend provides support for the stress based diffusion model. Whilst surface area is an important property of the aluminium adherend in producing durable bonding, the best durability achievable, between an epoxy adhesive and aluminium substrate, requires a component of surface roughness which enhances the load sharing capability in the interfacial bonding region. This component of durability performance is predicted by the model. In more specific terms, a boiling water treatment of the aluminium adherend indicates a direct correlation between bond durability, surface area and topography. The characterisation of film properties indicates that the film chemistry does not change as a function of treatment conditions, however, the film topography and surface area does. The overall bond durability performance is linked to both of these properties. The detailed examination of the hydrated oxide film, produced by the boiling water treatment of aluminium, is the first time the bond durability performance has been related to the film topography. It is also the first occasion that the mechanism of film growth has been examined over such a large treatment time. The combination of surface analysis and bond durability measurements is invaluable in confirming the properties, predicted by the stress based diffusion model, which are responsible in forming fracture resistant adhesive bonds in humid conditions.  The bond durability of high surface area and low surface area hydrated oxide films indicates that surface area is an important property. However, this study confirms that the absence of the preferred surface topography limits the ultimate bond durability performance attainable. The fracture toughness measurements performed on aluminium adherends pre-treated with a low surface area film also supports the mechanism of load sharing of interfacial adhesive bonds and its contribution to the overall bond durability. The role performed by the individual molecules and particles in an oxide film is similar to the load sharing performed by the silane coupling agent molecules.  Further support for the stress based diffusion model is provided by films produced on aluminium immersed in nickel salt solutions. The topography of these film alters as a function of treatment time and this is directly related to fracture toughness in humid environments. This work provides the first instance where such films have been characterised in detail and their properties related to bond durability performance. The study is also the first time that the growth mechanism of the film produced on the aluminium substrate has been examined in detail. The film growth mechanism supports the film growth model proposed for the hydrated oxide film produced by the boiling water treatment.  The major findings presented in this thesis are summarised as the direct correlation between surface profile angle, the importance of co-operative load sharing of interfacial adhesive bonds and the relative insignificance of surface oxide hydration in the formation of durable aluminium-epoxy adhesion. This information is used to develop a stress based diffusion model which has the capacity to describe the fracture toughness of a range of aluminium-epoxy adhesive joint systems in humid environments. The stress based diffusion model is also capable of predicting the relative performance of the bond systems examined in the final chapters of the thesis, where complex interfacial oxide films are involved in the formation of adhesive bonds.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epoxy compounds</field><field name="subject">Adhesive joints</field><field name="subject">Aluminum alloys</field><field name="subject">Fracture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The harp extended: an exploration of resonance, mimicry and improvisation</field><field name="creator">Cooper, Clare Mary, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research project explores methods of extension of the pedal Harp vocabulary in an attempt to develop a unique language that challenges the instrument's stereotype and better responds to a range of contexts. I have investigated three key areas of extension: the physical structure of the Harp and its internal resonant spaces, mimicry as an exploratory tool useful in better understanding the Harp in relation to the Australian environment, and improvisation both free and structured used to challenge the vocabulary of the Harp in solo performance and collaborative contexts. The research stems from my longstanding curiosity with regards to the limits that a sanctioned or stereotyped repertoire of sounds and techniques places on an instrument for those who engage both as players and listeners. This critical commentary documents the results of the three areas of exploration indicated above as well as exploratory practice undertaken by other Harpists, it also discusses the problematic term 'extended techniques??? and draws on interviews conducted with progressive Harpists and improvisers with regards to extending the vocabulary of their own instruments. The sixty concerts I have performed internationally over the research period have also been central to my research. The final work consists of three elements: a solo Improvised Harp performance in my family home in suburban Sydney (filmed and recorded), a recording of Second Stabbing (Ohnedaruth), a Harp-lead composition by my Berlin-based ensemble: Hammeriver, and a series of three short studies composed of recordings of the resonant spaces inside the Harp entitled Spinal Fluid. All four pieces draw from and address what I have learnt from exploring the resonant physical structure, mimicry and improvisation. The result is a unique language that challenges the stereotypical profile of the Harp as a decorative instrument by embracing both its unique resonance and capacity for darkness, subtlety and texture. This language allows for a more flexible response to a broader range of contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assimilating complex information</field><field name="creator">Pollock, Edwina Jane, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Methods of instruction which are intended to facilitate understanding tend to incorporate all of the elements required for understanding in the instructions. Frequently, these types of instructions may overwhelm a learner???s limited working memory and hinder learning. The five experiments reported in this thesis were generated by cognitive load theory. Cognitive load theory is based on the assumption that features of human cognitive architecture have important implications for how we learn and understand. The experiments examined an alternative approach to instructional design which had the goal of promoting schema construction in order to foster understanding. A two phase, isolated-interacting elements learning approach was developed which, in the first phase, artificially reduced the element interactivity of complex material by presenting the material as isolated elements of information that could be processed serially, rather than simultaneously, in working memory. In the second phase of instruction, all the information for understanding was presented. The control group???s instruction was a more conventional approach to promoting understanding where all the information for understanding was presented in both Phase 1 and 2. Although a possible consequence of artificially reducing the element interactivity of material may be an initial decrease in a student???s capacity for understanding, it was hypothesised that over the longer term it would lead to an increase in learners??? understanding. The results reported in this thesis provide powerful evidence that for certain groups of learners, information is better learnt through the isolated-interacting elements instructional method. Evidence is also provided in support of the proposal that schema construction is the mechanism underlying the success of the isolated-interacting elements instructional method. Experiments 1 and 3 demonstrated that when novice students are required to learn complex information, the isolated-interacting elements method of instruction was superior to the control method. In contrast, no evidence was found in Experiments 2 and 4 to suggest a difference between these instructional techniques. These contrasting results can be explained by the different levels of domain knowledge possessed by the participants of each experiment. The results of Experiment 5 were similar to those of Experiments 1 and 3, namely that students performed superiorly if they had studied the isolated elements followed by interacting elements instruction. These results provide significant theoretical support for the claim that expertise is the key factor implicated in the beneficial effects associated with the isolated-interacting elements instructional technique since the participants in Experiment 5 had previously participated in Experiments 2 and 4. The difference in the outcomes of these experiments can be explained by the level of domain specific knowledge the participants of Experiment 5 had in each of the knowledge domains tested by the various experiments.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human information processing</field><field name="subject">Cognition Testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17813</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women, sport and ethnicity: exploring experiences of difference in netball</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Tracy Lynn, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates how sports organisations and discourses have impacted on the sports participation of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in Australia.  A series of national participation studies have documented that women from minority ethnic backgrounds have significantly lower participation rates in sports and physical activity than Anglo-Australian women.  However, the explanations and dimensions of this difference have not been examined in previous research.  The experiences of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds are used in this thesis to explore sports discourses and organisation and the embodiments of their interrelationship.  The present research proposes that sports organisations and discourses within Australia have historically served to marginalise women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.  The arguments for this position are explored using a local narrative which details the situated nature of women????s experiences of sports.  These experiences are located within a historical context that traces migration policies, the growth and development of sports and women????s social relations since white settlement of Australia.  It is argued that contemporary sports discourses and organisation are inextricably tied to Australia????s colonial and imperialist past.  Theories of ethnicity, gender and sports are analysed.  The theoretical perspective taken in this thesis builds on feminist ideologies and ethnicity studies.  Empirical analysis is undertaken using gender relations to situate sport as a site of cultural struggles best understood through investigations of history and diversity.  Aspects of power, control and influence are central to this thesis.  The empirical component of this thesis uses secondary data sources, surveys and interviews to investigate the research proposition.  This is achieved on two levels.  The first level interrogates existing data to create a macro level analysis of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds in sports.  A survey of 972 schoolgirls was undertaken to collect information on sports participation and attitudes to sports.  This was followed by 30 interviews with women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds that explored individual sports experiences and perspectives on sports.  The second level of investigation employed the case study of netball to examine the research question as it related to a specific sports organisation.  The case study component of the research involved document and archival analysis, a survey of 372 netball players and interviews with 18 women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and former and current netball administrators.  The thesis analyses the empirical data as it relates to the organisation and discourse of sports in Australia.   The principal conclusion reached is that sports organisation and discourses are located within a societal power structure that places women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds on its margins.  Sports participation is predicated on conformity to existing cultural practices and expectations and it does little to facilitate cultural diversity.  The women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds who participated in the research did not perceive sports as particularly inclusive of gender and culture.  The examination of netball demonstrated that netball has not been concerned with ????other???? women, rather it has focussed its efforts on appealing to ????mainstream???? women.  While netball has not explicitly excluded the involvement of women from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, neither has it actively encouraged cultural diversity.  This thesis makes a contribution to knowledge in the field of sports studies with its empirical research and through the ensuing development of a framework for locating the implications of inclusion or exclusion in sports organisations and discourses. This understanding can be used to assess and inform future sports policy development and practice.  Principally, the thesis seeks to acknowledge and legitimise the sports experiences of women from diverse backgrounds and in doing so provides insights into a better theoretical understanding about the nexus of gender, ethnicity and sports.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Netball Australia</field><field name="subject">Sports for women Australia</field><field name="subject">Minorities in sports Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17816</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of residual atmospheric delay in the low latitude regions using network-based GPS positioning</field><field name="creator">Musa, Tajul Ariffin, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The atmosphere in low latitude regions is of particular interest to GPS researchers because the propagation of GPS signals becomes significantly delayed compared with other regions of the world. Hence this limits GPS positioning accuracy in equatorial regions. Although the atmospheric delay can be modelled, a residual component will still remain. Reducing, or mitigating the effect of residual atmospheric delay is of great interest, and remains a challenge, especially in equatorial regions. Analysis of relative positioning accuracy of GPS baselines has confirmed that the residual atmospheric delay is distance-dependent, even in low latitude areas. Residual ionospheric delay is the largest component in terms of both absolute magnitude and variability. However it can be largely eliminated by forming the ionosphere-free combination of measurements made on two frequencies. The residual tropospheric delay is smaller in magnitude but rather problematic due to strong spatio-temporal variations of its wet component. Introducing additional troposphere ???scale factors??? in the least squares estimation of relative position can reduce the effect of the residual. In a local GPS network, the distance-dependent errors can be spatially modelled by network-based positioning. The network-based technique generates a network ???correction??? for user positioning. The strategy is to partition this network correction into dispersive and non-dispersive components. The latter can be smoothed in order to enhance the ionosphere-free combination, and can be of benefit to ambiguity resolution. After this step, both the dispersive and non-dispersive correction components can be used in the final positioning step. Additional investigations are conducted for stochastic modelling of network-based positioning. Based on the least squares residuals, the variance-covariance estimation technique can be adapted to static network-based positioning. Moreover, a two-step procedure can be employed to deal with the temporal correlation in the measurements. Test results on GPS networks in low latitude and mid-latitude areas have demonstrated that the proposed network-based positioning strategy works reasonably well in resolving the ambiguities, assisting the ambiguity validation process and in computing the user???s position. Furthermore, test results of stochastic modelling in various GPS networks suggests that there are improvements in validating the ambiguity resolution results and handling the temporal correlation, although the positioning result do not differ compared to using the simple stochastic model typically used in standard baseline processing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GPS receivers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The evolution of subsidiaries: the case of michelin in Thailand</field><field name="creator">Sakolvieng, Ketkamol, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study has investigated the evolution of Michelin Siam Group (MSG), a Thai subsidiary of the Michelin Group (France), over the period between 1987 and 2007. Particular attention has been given to the process of changing subsidiary roles as well as factors influencing the process. The study has adopted a qualitative case-study approach based on the data collected from interviews of senior managers at MSG. The analysis has demonstrated that over the past 20 years, MSG has undergone several changes in its charters and capabilities, with the changes in its roles accordingly. In its early years (pre-1997), MSG was a ??local implementer?? in its MNC network, mainly serving the local market in a limited range of product lines mandated by the headquarters (HQs). Its charters, both manufacturing and commercial charters, have since been extended to cover broader product lines and international markets beyond Thailand through the accumulation of production capabilities enhanced by a range of training programmes. MSG has thus increasingly shifted from a ??local implementer?? to a ??regional/global implementer??. More importantly, it has also been revealed that the changes in MSG??s roles have been strongly influenced by the HQs. Through its control over decision making, the HQs has been heavily involved in introducing changes at MSG. However, the role of subsidiary, industry, and local environment factors should not be neglected. MSG??s increasing capabilities and superior performance coupled with the favourable and dynamic local environment as well as the competitive nature of an industry have been found to have instigated HQs?? favourable decisions for MSG. While the HQs has been the dominant driver of MSG??s roles and changes in its roles, the findings of this study largely appear to support the influences of the interplay of corporate, subsidiary, industry, and local environment factors in shaping subsidiary roles over time.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">subsidiary roles</field><field name="subject">subsidiary evolution</field><field name="subject">MNC subsidiary management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differentiation and migration of Sca-1+/CD 31-cardiac side population cells in a mouse infarction model</field><field name="creator">Tan, Yew Liang Terence, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Myocardial infarction is the most common cause of heart failure and remains one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in humans. Stem cells are important in the maintenance and repair of adult tissues. Hoechst effluxing cells, termed side population cells are a rare subset of cells found in adult tissues that are highly enriched for stem and progenitor cell activity. Recent studies have suggested that Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells are capable of differentiation into cardiomyocytes in vitro. However, the response of cardiac side population cells to myocardial injury remains unknown in vivo. In this study, we directly transplanted Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells into an acutely infarcted mouse heart. After two weeks, the transplanted cells were found to express cardiomyocyte or endothelial cell markers. Importantly, when these cells were transplanted into a remote nonischemic part of the heart after MI, they were able to migrate to the damaged myocardium. Consistent with these cells homing property, we found that SDF-1&#945;, a chemotactic chemokine and its receptor, CXCR4 were up-regulated in the damaged myocardium and on Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac SP cells respectively following an acute myocardial infarction. We further showed that SDF-1&#945; was able to induce migration of Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells in vitro. Our results have therefore suggested that Sca-1+/CD31- cardiac side population cells are able to migrate to damaged myocardium from non-ischemic myocardium and differentiate into cardiomyocytes as well as endothelial cells in the acutely infarcted mouse heart. We postulate that the SDF-1&#945;/CXCR4 interaction may play an important role in the migration of these cells. Understanding and enhancing these processes may hold enormous potential possibilities for therapeutic myocardial regeneration for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiac stem cells</field><field name="subject">myocardial infarction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of the process of evolution and impact of internet technologies on firm behaviour and performance using narrative sequence methods</field><field name="creator">Buttriss, Gary John, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research suggests that to model the complex dynamics of the organisational change in a firm evolving as it implements internet technologies requires capturing diverse independent and interdependent processes across multiple temporal and spatial context both within and external to the firm. This presents both an ontological and epistemological challenge as dominant research methods are either atemporal in nature and attribute action to disembodied variables or are simply storytelling. To provide explanatory legitimacy requires going deeper to capture the action of actors 'acting' within multiple levels of context and to pinpoint deeper 'rock-bottom' causal mechanisms that drive the higher order processes that give rise to the 'organisational life' we observe.  To accomplish explanatory legitimacy I develop an analytical method that makes processuality fundamental and allows for the examination and theorising about mechanisms. The first essential element of this method is a framework that guides the researcher in the systematic gathering together of what we already know from the multidisciplinary and eclectic research in e-business, and in the intensive work of gathering empirical evidence. I apply a new methodology I call narrative sequence analysis, that combines process tracing and sequence analyses to make processes intelligible and help illustrate how mechanisms drive these processes. I use this method to develop an explanatory account of the process of e-business development covering three episodes of change within the Commonwealth Bank of Australia from 1995 to 2006. The research finds that the firm evolves over time as it develops new capabilities and identifies and pursues development opportunities by assembling and committing resources to e-business though both technology development and business application. It draws on past experience and gradually learns to develop, integrate and implement technology into existing business operations, discovers new innovative opportunities in which to apply the technology or is drawn into new areas by others who identify opportunities in which to apply the firm's knowledge, resources and technology.  The path to development depends on the firms starting position and the timing of the sequence of events encountered along the way. It is a coevolutionary process where the firm interacts, cooperates, adapts and responds to the actions and interactions of other actors, balanced by the uncertainty of e-business and business operation risk.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organisational development and change</field><field name="subject">Mechanisms</field><field name="subject">Processes</field><field name="subject">Causal explanation</field><field name="subject">E-business</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereotypic beliefs about young people: nature, sources, and consequences</field><field name="creator">Sankey, Melissa Elizabeth, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most stereotypes of youth depict them as problematic.  Yet, the effects of those representations on behaviour are not understood.  The nine studies conducted for this thesis investigated stereotypic beliefs about youth.  This thesis aimed to specify the range of stereotypic beliefs about youth, the sources of those beliefs, and the consequences of those beliefs for adults' and young people's behaviour. Chapter 1 reviews the stereotype literature and provides information about our current understanding of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  It also highlights the limitations of existing research and presents the rationale for this program of research.	Chapter 2 presents studies 1 to 4, which explored the breadth in the content of four sets of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  Study 1 investigated adults' knowledge of the cultural stereotype of youth and Study 2A specified adults' personal beliefs about youth.  Adults' knowledge of the cultural stereotype was shown to consist of very negative content, although their personal beliefs were both positive and negative in content.  Study 3A compared young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs about youth with their personal beliefs about youth.  Young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs were found to be extremely negative, and to be comparable with that identified as adults??? knowledge of the cultural stereotype of youth in Study 1. In contrast, young people???s personal beliefs about youth were found to be more positive.  Study 4 investigated the extent to which adults and young people hold multiple stereotypes of youth. Adults and young people formed six conceptually similar subtypes of youth.  They were labelled as ???yuppies???, ???lives for today and forget the consequences???, ???depressed???, ???problem kids???, ???active???, and ???conventional???.  The ???problem kids??? subtype was the most salient; it had the greatest number of descriptors assigned to it and the greatest agreement across groups regarding the constellation of traits and behaviours comprising it.	Studies 2B and 3B, also presented in Chapter 2, were carried out to develop two valid and reliable measures of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  In Study 2B, the 20-item Beliefs about Adolescence Scale was developed to assess adults' personal beliefs about youth.  Study 3B developed the 26-item Adolescents??? Perceptions of Adults??? Beliefs Scale to assess young people???s perceptions of adults??? beliefs about them. Both measures were shown to be internally consistent and to have good test-retest reliability.  The Beliefs about Adolescence Scale also demonstrated good convergent validity.	Chapter 3 presents studies 5 and 6, which examined the media as a possible source of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  Study 5 investigated media representations of youth as they appear in newspaper reports.  Study 6 aimed to establish an empirical association between those representations and stereotypic beliefs about youth.  In Study 5, newspaper reports of young people were found to be largely negative; the 'problem kids' stereotype was afforded the most news space.  In Study 6, newspaper readership was shown to be predictive of stereotypic beliefs about youth.  Further, stereotypic beliefs were found to discriminate between readers of broadsheet and tabloid newspapers.	Chapter 4 presents Studies 7 and 8, which focused on the consequences of stereotypic beliefs about youth for evaluations and behaviour.  Study 7 investigated the extent to which beliefs that young people are problematic affect adults' evaluations of young people.  Subjects who were presented with sentences that described irresponsible and disrespectful behaviours later judged a youth target as more irresponsible and disrespectful than subjects who were presented with sentences that described neutral behaviours.  Study 8 investigated whether beliefs that young people are problematic can result in self-fulfilling prophecies. Subjects were exposed to faces of male teenagers or adults and were then paired with partners who had been exposed to faces of male adults.  Each pair of subjects played a word-guessing game and their interaction was recorded.  Judges who were blind to the experimental hypotheses listened to the recordings and rated each participant for the degree of rudeness that was displayed.  Subjects who had been exposed to the teenage faces were rated as ruder than those who had been exposed to adult faces.  Moreover, those who interacted with subjects who had been exposed to teenage faces were rated as ruder than those who interacted with subjects who had been exposed to adult faces. In that way, stereotypic beliefs about youth were shown to produce self-fulfilling prophecies.	Chapter 5 presents Study 9.  Its focus was on young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs about them. It examined the way those beliefs influence young people's engagement in problem behaviour, in interaction with established correlates of problem behaviour.  This was explored via the testing of a structural model of problem behaviour.  The findings provided partial support for the model, and the model accounted for a substantial proportion of the variance in problem behaviour.  Young people's perceptions of adults' beliefs about them made an important contribution to the explanation of problem behaviour involvement.  Subsidiary analyses determined that young people's perceptions that adults believe them to engage in problem behaviour was the 'active ingredient' of that construct.  	Chapter 6 presents the general discussion of the findings from this program of research.  It also outlines their theoretical and practical implications, and points to specific research that is needed to add to the findings of this thesis.  The findings emphasise the important influences of stereotypic beliefs about youth on adults' and young people's behaviour.  Recommendations are made for improving adult-youth relations and preventing adolescent problem behaviour.  In particular, the media and adult members of the community need to recognise the role that they play in the causation of adolescent problem behaviour.  The media have a responsibility to disseminate accurate and balanced information about young people and youth-related issues.  In addition, interventions aimed at reducing adolescent problem behaviour need to incorporate a community-based component that seeks to promote positive adult-youth relations within the wider community.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Youth Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Adolescent psychology</field><field name="subject">Stereotype</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17826</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular epidemiology and detection of norovirus</field><field name="creator">Tu, Elise, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Norovirus (NoV) is a major cause of infectious human viral gastroenteritis.  Detection is important to understanding the epidemiology of NoV and the viral dynamics of NoV infection which is poorly understood.  In 2006, a marked increase in gastroenteritis outbreaks occurred worldwide.   During this period, a total of 231 stool samples were obtained from patients with acute gastroenteritis from Australia and New Zealand.  A total of 186 isolates of NoV were detected and sequenced to determine the genotype and relatedness to known epidemic NoV GII.4 variants.  Two GII.4 variants, 2006a and 2006b, were identified in 61.8% and 11.3%, in these cases, respectively.  Thus, the increase in NoV gastroenteritis in 2006 was linked to the emergence of two novel co-circulating GII.4 variants, 2006a and 2006b.  During an outbreak in an aged-care facility, stool samples were collected from the onset of illness to cessation of viral excretion.  Here, viral shedding peaked in the acute stage of illness and continued for an average of 28.7 days.  The viral decay rate was 0.76 per day.  Prolonged asymptomatic shedding of NoV was detected in the elderly. A quality control for the assessment of molecular based viral assays for NoV and other RNA viruses is necessary to meet current testing requirements.  Available controls only monitor the RNA and DNA amplification steps.  An MS2 bacteriophage BioBallTM with 100 pfu was evaluated and applied as a multi-purpose phage control.  It was assessed as a quality control, in comparison to MS2 phage stock, to validate MS2 phage assays.  Furthermore, MS2 BioBallTM was used as a process control for the molecular detection of RNA viruses.  It validated every performed step, determined if the assay worked and its sensitivity.  Thus, MS2 BioBallTM offered uniformity, stability and reproducibility across molecular based viral detection systems.  Overall, this thesis provided valuable insight into the molecular epidemiology of NoV in the southern hemisphere and nature of NoV infections in the elderly.  The MS2 BioBallTM provides standardisation and quality control of viral RNA assays.  Understanding the genetic diversity and viral dynamics of NoV will be crucial to developing effective intervention and treatment strategies, and ultimately lead to reduced viral gastroenteritis worldwide.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quality control</field><field name="subject">Norovirus</field><field name="subject">Molecular epidemiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The professional life-cycles and professional development of adult teachers of English to speakers of other languages (TESOL)</field><field name="creator">Waites, Carol Katherine, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">THE PROFESSIONAL LIFE-CYCLES AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT TEACHERS OF ENGLISH TO SPEAKERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES (TESOL)  This thesis focuses on the findings of a research study conducted in Geneva and Sydney to examine the career cycles of TESOLs.  It explores many of the issues investigated in Huberman???s study of 160 secondary school teachers in Geneva (1989, 1993).  Seventy-three in-depth interviews were conducted with teachers and trainers / administrators in adult TESOL, and professional development issues were examined in greater detail than in the Huberman study.  The central purpose of the study was to test the universality of the Huberman model of career phases.  TESOLs were found to have far more variations during their career cycles than school teachers, who were in a more stable and predictable situation.  The study focused on particular moments in the career cycle, exploring TESOLs??? levels of satisfaction.  TESOLs in the present study were found to have similar intrinsic satisfactions and concerns about working conditions as the findings of other TESOL studies.  Although the occupation was reportedly becoming increasingly more professional, its unpredictable nature made it stimulating and rewarding.  In spite of the instability of the TESOL career, TESOLs appeared to have more positive career experiences overall than many school teachers with more stable career paths.  The study also examined professional development issues by comparing the perceptions of TESOLs and their trainers / administrators.  They had many divergent opinions as to the professional development requirements of TESOLs.  While there was no conclusive evidence that professional development could be linked to stages, TESOLs in a phase of diversification were found to have different professional development requirements from other phases.  Personal, professional and environmental factors also affect the professional development requirements of TESOLs at any stage.  In summary, it appears that the traditional career phase model is inappropriate when applied to TESOLs, and perhaps for other similarly unstable careers.  With the recent changes in people???s professional lives, requiring increasing mobility and adaptability in the changing job market, other career path models to guide counselling, professional development and other staff management programs will need to be explored.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Career development</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">English language</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching</field><field name="subject">Foreign speakers</field><field name="subject">English teachers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17832</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physical/virtual sites: using creative practice to develop alternative communicative spaces</field><field name="creator">Kaye, Nicola, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis interrogates my and others?? creative praxis using the tools of the Internet, webcam, blogging and digital video, to elucidate possibilities for communication.

Many cultural commentators consider the Internet as a new kind of public sphere, developing community, strengthening the lifeworld and providing ethical discourse. The Internet, however, is a context not without problems. Still, less that one quarter of the world??s population has access, and computer illiteracy and governance (to name only a few) contribute to its limitations ?? this dichotomy is central to my investigation. I demonstrate that information communication technologies (ICTs) such as the Internet are radically altering our everyday lives and mediation is increasingly pervasive. I argue, therefore, that our globalised context demands alternative communicative spaces to mainstream media that allow diversity, plurality, intersubjectivity and new forms of interrogation. I ask whether the Internet can assist in the development of social networks and newest social movements (NSMs) by increasing civic bonds and communities. I posit communicative action, reflexivity and praxis as productive tools for a critical practice. I suggest that these theories are influential in researching the Internet??s potential in generating social awareness. I argue that the Internet can be used to construct social spaces and, in conjunction with creativity, can increase its productive capacity in developing diverse and ethical communicative contexts.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">creative practice</field><field name="subject">physical/virtual</field><field name="subject">social networks/spaces</field><field name="subject">communicative spaces</field><field name="subject">reflexivity</field><field name="subject">public sphere</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42742</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information flow security - models, verification and schedulers</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Chenyi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Information flow security concerns how to protect sensitive data in computer systems by avoiding undesirable flow of information between the users of the systems. This thesis studies information flow security properties in state-based systems, dealing in particular with modelling and verification methods for asynchronous systems and synchronous systems with schedulers. The aim of this study is to provide a foundational guide to ensure confidentiality in system design and verification.  The thesis begins with a study of definitions of security properties in asynchronous models. Two classes of security notions are of particular interest. Trace-based properties disallow deductions of high security level secrets from low level observation traces. Bisimulation-based properties express security as a low-level observational equivalence relation on states. In the literature, several distinct schools have developed frameworks for information flow security properties based on different semantic domains. One of the major contributions of the thesis is a systematic study that compares security notions, using semantic mappings between two state-based models and a particular process algebraic model.  An advantage of state-based models is the availability of well-developed verification methods and tools for functional properties in finite state systems. The thesis investigates the application of these methods to the algorithmic verification of the information flow security properties in the asynchronous settings. The complexity bounds for verifying these security properties are given as polynomial time for the bisimulation-based properties and polynomial space complete for the trace-based properties. Two heuristics are presented to benefit the verifications of the properties in practice. Timing channels are one of the major concerns in the computer security community, but are not captured in asynchronous models. In the final part of the thesis, a new system model is defined that deals with timing and scheduling. A group of novel security notions, including both trace-based and bisimulation-based properties, are proposed in this new model. It is further investigated whether these security properties are preserved by refinement of schedulers and scheduler implementations. A case study of a multi- evel secure file server is described, which applies a number of access control rules to enforce a particular bisimulation-based property in the synchronous setting.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information flow</field><field name="subject">Formal methods</field><field name="subject">Security</field><field name="subject">Noninterference</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43410</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar for land deformation monitoring</field><field name="creator">Chang, Hsing-Chung, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Australia is one of the leading mineral resource extraction nations in the world. It is one of the world&#146;s top producers of nickel, zinc, uranium, lithium, coal, gold, iron ore and silver. However, the complexity of the environmental issues and the potentially damaging consequences of mining have attracted public attention and political controversy. Other types of underground natural resource exploitation, such as ground water, gas or oil extractions, also cause severe land deformation on different scales in space and time. The subsidence due to underground mining and underground fluid extractions has the potential to impact on surface and near surface infrastructure; as well as water quality and quantity, that in turn has the potential to impact on threatened flora and fauna, and biodiversity conservation. Subsidence can also impact natural and cultural heritage. To date, most of land deformation monitoring is done using conventional surveying techniques, such as total stations, levelling, GPS, etc. These surveying techniques provide high precision in height at millimetre accuracy, but with the drawbacks of inefficiency and costliness (labour intensive and time consuming) when surveying over a large area. Radar interferometry is an imaging technique for measuring geodetic information of terrain. It exploits phase information of the backscattered radar signals from the ground surface to retrieve the altitude or displacements of the objects. It has been successfully applied in the areas of cartography, geodesy, land cover characterisation, mitigation of natural or man-made hazards, etc. The goal of this dissertation was to develop a system which integrated differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), ground survey data and geographic information systems (GIS) as a whole to provide the land deformation maps for underground mining and water extraction activities. This system aimed to reinforce subsidence assessment processes and avoid or mitigate potential risks to lives, infrastructure and the natural environment. The selection of suitable interferometric pairs is limited to the spatial and temporal separations of the acquired SAR images as well as the characteristics of the site, e.g. slope of terrain, land cover, climate, etc. Interferometric pairs with good coherence were selected for further DInSAR analysis. The coherence analysis of both C- and L-band spaceborne SAR data was studied for sites in the State of New South Wales, Australia. The impact of the quality of the digital elevation models (DEM), used to remove the static topography in 2-pass DInSAR, were also analysed. This dissertation examined the quality of the DEM generated using aerial photogrammetry, InSAR, and airborne laser scanning (ALS) against field survey data. Kinematic and real-time kinematic GPS were introduced here as an efficient surveying method for collecting ground truth data for DEM validation. For mine subsidence monitoring, continuous DInSAR mine subsidence maps were generated using ERS-1/2, Radarsat-1 and JERS-1 data with the assumption of negligible horizontal displacement. One of the significant findings of this study was the results from the ERS-1/2 tandem DInSAR, which showed an immediate mine subsidence of 1cm occurred during a period of 24 hours. It also raised the importance of SAR constellations for disaster mitigation. In order to understand the 3-D displacement vectors of mine deformation, this dissertation also proposed a method using the SAR data acquired at 3 independent incidence angles from both ascending and descending orbits. Another issue of the high phase gradient, induced by the mine subsidence, was also addressed. Phase gradient was clearly overcome by having the L-band ALOS data with an imaging resolution of 10m, which is better than the imaging resolution of 18m of the previous generation of the Japanese L-band SAR satellite, JERS-1. The ground survey data over a similar duration was used for validation. Besides mine subsidence monitoring the land deformation caused by groundwater pumping were also presented. In contrast to mine subsidence, the underground water extraction induced subsidence has the characteristics of a slow rate of change and less predictable location and coverage. Two case studies were presented. One was at the geothermal fields in New Zealand and another was the urban subsidence due to underground water over exploitation in China. Both studies were validated against ground survey data. Finally, SAR intensity analysis for detecting land deformation was demonstrated when DInSAR was not applicable due to strong decorrelation. The region of land surface change, which may be caused by human activities or natural disasters, can be classified. Two cases studies were given. The first study was the surface change detection at an open-cut mine. The second one was the 2004 Asian tsunami damage assessment near Banda Aceh. The results presented in this dissertation showed that the integrated system of DInSAR, GIS and ground surveys has the potential to monitor mine subsidence over a large area. The accuracy of the derived subsidence maps can be further improved by having a shorter revisit cycle and better imaging resolution of the newly launched and planned SAR satellites and constellation missions. The subsidence caused by groundwater pumping can be monitored at an accuracy of millimetre by utilising the technique of persistent scatterer InSAR.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Remote sensing</field><field name="subject">Radar interferometry</field><field name="subject">Mine subsidence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of RasGRP1 and 4 in the pathogenesis of human diseases</field><field name="creator">Qi, Miao, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mast cells are known to play an important role in allergic events and in other inflammatory reactions through varied intracellular signaling transduction proteins. RasGRP4 is a mast cell-restricted guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and diacylglycerol (DAG)/phorbol ester receptor. Interleukin (IL) -13, a critical cytokine for allergic inflammation, exerts its effects through a complex receptor system including IL-4R&#945;, IL-13R&#945;1 and IL-13R&#945;2. IL-13R&#945;2 has been reported to be a decoy receptor for IL-13. My experiments indicate that the mast cell specific RasGRP4 protein regulates the level of IL 13R&#945;2 and controls IL-13/ IL 13R&#945;1-mediated intracellar signaling events in mast cells. Phosphorylation of STAT6 plays an important role in airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma. The development of therapeutics that can regulate RasGRP4 could be used to modulate the IL-13-induced phosphorylation of STAT-6 that may be used as therapy in patients with asthma. SLE is a complex, heterogeneous systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of high levels of autoantibodies. Dysregulation of RasGRP1, a Ras active gene, in mice resulted in a SLE-like disorder. Yasuda and coworkers demonstrated that a defective isoform of RasGRP1 (&#916;11) was present in a subset of patients with SLE. My experiments indicate that RasGRP1 upregulates the expression of IL2RG in T cells. In contrast the &#916;11 RasGRP1 isoform expressed in a subset of SLE patients leads to defective expression of IL2RG. The IL2RG chain is a common chain which forms part of a number of different receptors eg. IL-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 21. IL-2 as well as IL-21, which shares sequence homology with IL-2, has been reported to be involved in the generation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In SLE patients, CD4 + CD25+ Tregs, which play an essential role in controlling immunologic tolerance to self-antigens and preventing autoimmunity, are significantly decreased when compared with healthy controls. The accumulative evidence suggests that the defective isoform of RasGRP1 (&#916;11) downregulates expression of IL2RG in SLE patients?? T cells and this could effect the generation of CD4 + CD25+ Tregs. This may be another immunological mechanism in loss of tolerance observed in patient with SLE.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RasGRP4</field><field name="subject">Mast cell</field><field name="subject">RasGRP1</field><field name="subject">IL-13R&#945;2</field><field name="subject">IL2RG</field><field name="subject">asthma</field><field name="subject">SLE</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43521</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Qubit control-pulse circuits in SOS-CMOS technology for a Si:P quantum computer</field><field name="creator">Ekanayake, Sobhath Ramesh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microelectronics has shaped the world beyond what was thought possible at the time of its advent. One area of current research in this field is on the solid-state Si:P-based quantum computer (QC). In this machine, each qubit requires an individually addressed fast control-pulse for non-adiabatic drive and measure operations. Additionally, it is increasingly becoming important to be able to interface nanoelectronics with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology. In this work, I have designed and demonstrated full-custom mixed-mode and full-digital fast control-pulse generators fabricated in a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) CMOS commercial foundry process ?? a radio-frequency (RF) CMOS technology. These circuits are, fundamentally, fast monostable multivibrators.  Initially, after the design specifications were decided upon, I characterized NFET and PFET devices and a n+-diffusion resistor from 500 nm and 250 nm commercial SOS-CMOS processes. Measuring their conductance curves at 300 300 K, 4.2 2 K, and sub-K (30 30 mK base to 1000 1000 mK) showed that they function with desirable behaviour although exhibiting some deviations from their 300 300 K characteristics.  The mixed-mode first generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing that it produced dwell-time adjustable pulses with 100 100 ps rise-times at 300  K, 4.2 2 K, and sub-K with a power dissipation of 12 12 uW at 100 100 MHz. The full-digital second generation control-pulse generator was demonstrated showing accurately adjustable dwell-times settable via a control-word streamed synchronously to a shift-register. The design was based on a ripple-counter with provisions for internal or external clocking.  This research has demonstrated that SOS-CMOS technology is highly feasible for the fabrication of control microelectronics for a Si:P-based QC.

One important aspect of individual management plans is the stability of the monument. Borobudur, in Central Java, uncovered in a state of dilapidation in the early nineteenth century and finally restored in the second half of the twentieth century was restored using internal beams and injection technology with the view of providing a stable foundation for the foreseeable future. In the past, classical surveying separated the vertical and horizontal components. This separation often resulted in different stations having different information. Moreover, one technique was not generally able to add constraints to the other. Today's surveyors and Cultural Heritage managers use the Global Positioning System which is able to provide precise and reliable information for both the horizontal and vertical components, thereby unifying the networks and maximizing individual strengths, especially the underground marks associated with precise leveling, which are significantly less prone to local erratic movement than surface marks. Of necessity, any measurement of change involves at least two observation epochs. In general the precision is tied to the number of epochs and the span between the epochs. Since this study has had only two observation epochs, the results can only be described as preliminary or indicative. Never the less, there are a number of clear trends that are apparent. The first important point is that GPS is able to deliver precisions that are near 1 mm in the horizontal and 2-3 mm in the vertical relative to a regional fiducial control network. This is comparable to terrestrial surveying techniques. Moreover, it is accomplished in 10 to 14 days compared to many weeks for leveling. The second is that the level of redundancy and spatial coherence is very high enabling errors and outliers to be readily detected. This was used extensively as part of the quality assurance program adopted in this study. The third point is that no alarming deformation of the temple has been detected. At this stage of the study, the 95% confidence levels are quite large due mainly to only 2 epochs being observed but also in part to the way the models, especially the GLOBK model, has been implemented due to the limited number of epochs and the limited time span. It is expected that the model of tectonic motion which connects one epoch to the next will improve dramatically with a third epoch, and this will significantly improve the precision of the observation stations on the temple at the stupa level and on the buttress level. However, there is already clear evidence that some of the buttress level stations are in an unstable environment compared with stupa level stations and this is primarily due to their location. Finally, GPS offers the prospect of fast and hence repeatable work. Kinematic GPS techniques can certainly be used to densify stations and to increase our knowledge of the structural effects of deformation. However, much needs to be done to ensure that satellite tracking is of high quality and able to successfully resolve the ambiguities on an epoch by epoch basis.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39994</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The decline in italian public support for the euro: The role of economic factors</field><field name="creator">De Matteis, Giulia, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis documents the changes in Italian public opinion towards the Euro. Its aim is to assess the relevance of economic factors for the decline in Italian support for the common currency. The thesis begins by assessing the extent to which support for the Euro has declined in Italy. While there has been popular, media and political comment on this issue, the thesis investigates the changes in attitude through the use of survey material and concludes that there is compelling evidence that public support for the Euro has declined in Italy. The thesis adopts a utilitarian/rational choice approach in order to investigate the reasoning behind the Italian public's developing relationship with the single currency from 1998 to the present. Its central question is: How have economic factors impacted on the Italian public's support for the Euro? The analysis focuses on Italians' perceptions - not their actual knowledge - of national and individual level economic changes brought about by the single currency. The thesis investigates how such perceptions have impacted Italian popular support for the Euro over the period 1998-2007. The method employed in this thesis is primarily based around analysing quantitative data gathered from Standard and Flash Eurobarometers. Other sources considered are academic literature and newspaper articles. The analysis clearly suggests that Italians' optimism towards their national and personal economic situations have all decreased since the Euro was introduced, concurrently with their diminishing support for the Euro. This work suggests that the main reason for decreased support lies in Italian perceptions that the Euro has contributed to worsening economic situations at both the national and individual levels. In particular, Italians believe the Euro has spurred inflation and diminished their purchasing power, and accuse it of failing to promote economic growth and jobs. However, Eurobarometer data combined with newspaper articles indicate that it is the perceived economic consequences at the individual level - loss of purchasing power due to Euro-related price increases, and pessimism towards their household financial situation - that more strongly determine Italians' decreasing support for the Euro.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public support</field><field name="subject">Euro</field><field name="subject">Italy</field><field name="subject">Economic factors</field><field name="subject">Eurobarometers</field><field name="subject">Inflation</field><field name="subject">Purchasing power</field><field name="subject">1998-2007</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43578</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection, characterization and mitigation of interference in receivers for global navigation satellite systems</field><field name="creator">Tabatabaei Balaei, Asghar, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">GPS has become very popular in recent years. It is used in wide range of applications including aircraft navigation, search and rescue, space borne attitude and position determination and cellular network synchronization. Each application places demands on GPS for various levels of accuracy, integrity, system availability and continuity of service. Radio frequency interference (RFI) which results from many sources such as TV/FM harmonics, radar or mobile satellite systems, presents a challenge to the use of GPS. It can affect all the service performance indices mentioned above. To improve the accuracy of GPS positioning, a continuously operating reference station (CORS) network can be used. A CORS network provides all the enabled GPS users in an area with corrections to the fundamental measurements, producing more precise positioning. A threat to these networks is a threat to all high-accuracy GPS users. It is therefore necessary to monitor the quality of the received signal with the objective of promptly detecting the presence of RFI and providing a timely warning of the degradation of system accuracy, thereby boosting the integrity of GPS. This research was focused on four main tasks: a)	Detection. The focus here is on a power spectral density fluctuation detection technique, in which statistical inference is used to detect narrowband continuous-wave (CW) interference in the GPS signal band after being captured by the RF front-end.  An optimal detector algorithm is proposed. At this optimal point, for a fixed Detection Threshold (DT), probability of false alarm becomes minimal and for a fixed probability of false alarm, we can achieve the minimum value for the detection threshold. Experiments show that at this point we have the minimum computational load. This theoretical result is supported by real experiments. Finally this algorithm is employed to detect a real GPS interference signal generated by a TV transmitter in Sydney.  b)	Characterization. In the characterization section, using the GNSS signal structure and the baseband signal processing inside the GNSS receiver, a closed formula is derived for the received signal quality in terms of effective carrier to noise ratio ( ). This formula is tested and proved by calculating the C/No using the I and Q data from a software GPS receiver. For pulsed CW, a similar analysis is done to characterize the effect of parameters such as pulse repetition period (PRP) and also duty cycle on the received signal quality. Considering this characterization and the commonality between the GPS C/A code and Galileo signal as a basis to build up a common term for satellite availability, the probability of satellite availability in the presence of CW interference is defined and for the two currently available satellite navigation systems (GPS L1 signal and Galileo signal (GIOVE-A BOC(1, 1) in the E1/L1 band)) it is shown that they can be considered as alternatives to each other in the presence of different RFI frequencies as their availability in the presence of CW RFI is different in terms of RFI frequency.  c)	Mitigation. The last section of the research presents a new concept of ?Satellite Exclusion Zone?. In this technique, using our previously developed characterization techniques, and considering the fact that RFI has different effects on different satellite signals at different times depending on satellite Doppler frequency, the idea of excluding the most vulnerable satellite signal from positioning calculations is proposed. Using real data and real interference, the effectiveness of this technique is proven and its performance analyzed.  d)	Hardware implementation. The above detection technique is implemented using the UNSW FPGA receiver board called NAMURU.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interference.</field><field name="subject">GPS.</field><field name="subject">Receiver.</field><field name="subject">Global Positioning System.</field><field name="subject">Inertial navigation systems.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in surveying.</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in navigation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disturbances of autonomic functions in spinal cord injury: autonomic dysreflexia and thermoregulation</field><field name="creator">Kalincik, Tomas, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Disorders of the autonomic nervous system constitute serious complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) and their treatment is usually highly prioritised by spinal patients. Among these, autonomic dysreflexia and impaired thermoregulation are potentially life threatening conditions and require effective management. Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), progenitor cells and polymeric scaffolds have been tested in animal models of SCI and some of them have been considered for clinical trials. However, evaluation of the effect of such interventions on autonomic functions has received only rudimentary attention and would require a more thorough experimental assessment before the methods are utilised in human patients. This thesis tested two potential therapeutic strategies for autonomic dysreflexia and examined disorders of thermoregulatory functions in a rat model of spinal cord transection. Magnitude and duration of autonomic dysreflexia were evaluated with radio telemetry in spinalised animals treated with (i) implants of OECs and olfactory neurosphere-derived cells seeded in poly(lactic co glycolic) porous scaffolds or with (ii) transplants of OECs alone. (iii) Effects of SCI and of OECs on the morphology of sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs; which are involved in pathogenesis of autonomic dysreflexia) stained for NADPH diaphorase were examined. (iv) Doppler ultrasonography and infrared thermography were used to assess responses of tail blood flow and surface temperature to cold. Transplants of OECs alone, but not in combination with olfactory neurosphere-derived cells and polymeric scaffolds, resulted in significantly shortened episodes of autonomic dysreflexia. This may be attributed to the alterations to the morphology of SPNs adjacent to the lesion: a transient increase in the morphometric features of the SPNs was evoked by spinal cord transection and this was further altered by transplantation of OECs. The thesis also showed that local responses of tail blood flow and temperature to cold were not abolished by complete SCI suggesting that temperature homeostasis could still be maintained in response to cold. It is hypothesised that OECs facilitate improved recovery from autonomic dysreflexia through alteration of the morphology of SPNs. Furthermore, it is suggested that the role of the tail in heat conservation can be regulated by mechanisms that are independent of the descendent neural control from supraspinal centres.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thermoregulation</field><field name="subject">spinal cord injury</field><field name="subject">autonomic dysreflexia</field><field name="subject">olfactory ensheathing cells</field><field name="subject">olfactory stem cells</field><field name="subject">sympathetic preganglionic neurons</field><field name="subject">infrared thermography</field><field name="subject">radio-telemetry</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43516</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Substrates of Transgression: A ??i??ekian Account of  Four Iceberg Slim Novellas</field><field name="creator">Cleveland, Matthew, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">The writings of controversial ???underground??? figure Iceberg Slim feature identities and sub-cultures either antagonistic to, or otherwise not commensurable with, mainstream American Orders of Discourse. Within the ex-pimp???s narrative dystopia, a provocative and unreservedly profane idiom is employed not only to champion normatively marginalized or demonized subjectivities (such as African-Americans, the underclass, pimps and ???hustlers???), but also to identify and condemn the policies and praxes hegemonizing the Social domain. Moreover, although Slim is one of the most widely-read African-American authors, there has been to date almost no critical engagement with his work. The two primary objectives of this Thesis were: firstly, to evaluate and elucidate the transgressive potential posed by the Slimian narrative universe; and secondly, to demonstrate that the genus of Lacanian, post-Marxian and other dialectical heuristics developed by Slavoj ??i??ek offered the most expedient means of achieving the first objective. More specifically, via investigating the discursive and trans-discursive coordinates of marginal identity as dramatized in four of Slim???s most popular novellas (Pimp, Trick Baby, Mama Black Widow, and Death Wish), we sought to ascertain the degree to which Slim???s particular representational negotiations of identity and identification operate to undermine, or (inadvertently) support, dominant ideological formulations. Further, this investigation adopted a ??i??ekian approach to develop a framework through which the (social, ethical, ideological, aesthetic, psychical and libidinal) issues surrounding Power that are at stake could be meaningfully evaluated. Our cardinal hypotheses concerned the basic dialectical postulation that the key to understanding hegemonic operations lies not in the content of those operations, but rather in the form(s) through which they are brought to bear.  The results obtained in this Thesis were consistent with the fundamental hypotheses posed and served also to achieve our primary objectives. Namely, our ??i??ekian approach identified and explained various structural and psychical features which were crucial in determining not only the antagonisms between (and inherent to) the vicissitudes of Power and the metastases of Its transgression (or not) within the Slimian universe, but also our apprehension of those antagonisms. In our enumeration of at least three discreet modalities of transgression, we finally concluded that the most radical dimension of the Slimian universe was to be located in the inherent undecidability between its affiliations with incommensurable ideological domains.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Iceberg Slim 1918</field><field name="subject">Zizek Slavoj</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17864</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and Testing of Augmentations of Continuously-Operating GPS Networks to Improve Their Spatial and Temporal Resolution</field><field name="creator">Ge, Linlin, School of Geomatic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Continuously-operating networks of GPS receivers (CGPS) are not capable of determining the characteristics of crustal deformation at the fine temporal or spatial scales required. Four ???temporal densification schemes??? and two 'spatial densification schemes' to augment the CGPS networks have been developed and tested. The four ???temporal densification schemes??? are based on the high rate Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS technique, GPS multipath effects, Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR). The 'serial scheme' based on using GPS as a seismometer has been proposed. Simulated seismic signals have been extracted from the very noisy high rate RTK-GPS results using an adaptive filter based on the least-mean-square algorithm. They are in very good agreement with those of the collocated seismometers. This scheme can improve the CGPS temporal resolution to 0.1 second. The 'retro-active scheme' takes advantage of the fact that the GPS multipath disturbance is repeated between consecutive days. It can therefore provide a means of correcting multipath errors in the observation data themselves. A reduction of the standard deviations of the pseudo-range and carrier phase multipath time series to about one fourth and one half the original values respectively, has been demonstrated. The 'all-GPS parallel scheme' uses the multipath effects as a signal to monitor the antenna environment. Models relating the changes of multipath and antenna environment have been derived. The 'cross-technique parallel scheme' integrates the collocated CGPS, VLBI and SLR results, taking advantage of the decorrelation among their biases and errors. Crustal displacement signature has been extracted as a common-mode signal using data from two stations: Matera in Italy and Wettzell in Germany. Two 'spatial densification schemes' which can verify with each other have been developed and tested. The 'soft' scheme integrates CGPS with radar interferometry (InSAR). The Double Interpolation and Double Prediction (DIDP) approach combines the strengths of the high temporal resolution of CGPS and the high spatial resolution possible with the InSAR technique. This scheme can improve the spatial resolution to about 25m. The 'hard' scheme requires the deployment of single-frequency receivers to in-fill the present CGPS arrays. Alternatively some receivers may be installed at some geophysically strategic sites outside existing CGPS arrays. The former has been tested within Japan's GEONET, while the latter has been tested using a five-station array.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17867</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A qualitative analysis of creativity as misrecognition in the transactions between a visual arts teacher and their senior art students in the final year of schooling</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Kerry Anne, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis researches the proposition that student creativity occurs as a function of misrecognition in the culturally situated context of art classrooms. Following Pierre Bourdieu??s socio-cognitive frameworks of the habitus, symbolic capital and misrecognition this study uses these concepts as a means of navigating teacher-student relationships at moments of creative origination. These concepts predict that exchanges between teachers and students are sites for transactions of symbolic capital where the teacher??s pedagogical role is objectively repressed through the mechanism of misrecognition. The study seeks evidence for creative autonomy as misrecognition as it takes place in classroom transactions and that differing levels of ??tact?? are employed in these exchanges. It emerges that the social reasoning that underscores these exchanges is inferentially sensitive to different contextual points of view, expressed in open secrets, repression, denial and euphemisation. The study finds that the artworks produced evidence degrees of originality that vary in character according to the subtlety of misrecognition that is transacted in these pedagogical exchanges. The case of an art teacher and an art class in the final year of schooling is examined in detail. The design employs an idiographic, qualitative methodology. Methods include observations and interviews which are augmented by digital records. Results are interpreted using a form of semantic analysis and triangulation. Four functions are distilled from the results. These functions govern the way in which misrecognition performs as a contradictory logic in the relationships between the teacher and students which works towards affirming the group??s belief in creative autonomy, while paradoxically, all members take advantage of the contextual inputs that are available. Creative autonomy is revealed as a fiction, nonetheless, a fiction worth nurturing for the successful realisation of creative ends. The study concludes that creativity cannot be strictly taught or learned. Nor is it innate and autonomous. Rather it encompasses a socially intelligent uptake in the culture of artmaking. What is possible is dependent on shared beliefs, desires and intentions which are transformed over time. Broader implications are suggested focusing on the significance of collaboration in creative education and the impact for educational systems, schools and undergraduate programs in art education.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">social reasoning</field><field name="subject">creativity</field><field name="subject">misrecognition</field><field name="subject">practical reasoning</field><field name="subject">art teaching</field><field name="subject">art making</field><field name="subject">Bourdieu</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Talent development in music: a comparative study between Sydney (Australia) and Seoul (Korea) on the emergence of talent, especially the interface between giftedness and talent</field><field name="creator">Park, Jeongmin, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate factors which can influence the emergence of high musical ability during the developmental process of musical talent achievement, comparing students in Seoul (Korea) and those in Sydney (Australia). The main focuses of the investigation concern the comparison of musical giftedness demonstrated in early childhood, the developmental process, and various factors, such as the environmental and intrapersonal, which can affect the emergence of talent, especially in those of different cultural backgrounds. For this purpose, Gagn????s Differentiated Model of Giftedness and Talent (DMGT, Gagn??, 2003) was adopted as an analytical tool for the present study, in particular for empirical research.  A total number of 137 students and 88 parents participated in this research. Student participants consisted of two groups: young musicians aged below 10 who show high musical achievements; and teenage students who are musically superior. All students completed a questionnaire, and their parents also completed a questionnaire. Data showed some significant differences between students in the two countries.  Three research instruments are employed based on Harnischmacher (1997). SCI (the Self-Concept Scale of Instrumental Abilities), GOP (Goal Orientation of Practice) and EAD (External Action Distraction) were included in the student questionnaire in order to examine intrapersonal catalysts (motivation) which can affect the developmental process of musical talent. A significant difference was found in SCI between countries. Self-concept of student groups in Sydney was significantly higher than that of students in Seoul among all age groups concerning musical abilities.  However, there were no significant differences in GOP and EAD between students in Seoul and Sydney. Other differences emerged concerning the role of parents, expenditure on music lessons, time spent on practice, and environmental factors. In particular, cultural milieu was revealed as one of important environmental factors in the present study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">talent</field><field name="subject">talent development</field><field name="subject">giftedness</field><field name="subject">musical ability</field><field name="subject">early musical signs</field><field name="subject">practice</field><field name="subject">phases of musical learning</field><field name="subject">Mozart</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum lattice models</field><field name="creator">Collins, Alexander Rory, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents studies of the low energy properties of nseveral frustrated spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnets using various analytic and computational methods. The models studied include the union jack model, the alternating Heisenberg chain, the Heisenberg bilayer model, and the spin-Peierls model. The union jack model is a Heisenberg antiferromagnetic spin model with frustration, and is analyzed using spin-wave theory. For small values of the frustrating coupling $\alpha$, the system is N{\' e}el ordered, while for large $\alpha$ the frustration is found to induce a canted phase. Spin wave theory with second order corrections finds the critical coupling at $\alpha \simeq 0.645$,which agrees quantitatively with series expansion results. No intermediate spin-liquid phase is found to exist between the two phases. The alternating Heisenberg chain is studied using an alternative triplet-wave expansion formalism for dimerized spin systems, modification of the ??bond operator?? formalism of Sachdev and Bhatt. Projection operators are used to confine the system to the physical subspace, rather than constraint equations. Comparisons are made with the results of dimer series expansions and exact diagonalization. The S=1/2 Heisenberg bilayer spin model at zero temperature is studied in the dimerized phase using analytic triplet-wave expansions and dimer series expansions. The occurrence of two-triplon bound states in the S=0 and S=1 channels, and antibound states in the S=2 channel, is predicted with triplet-wave theory and confirmed by series expansions. All bound states are found to vanish at or before the critical coupling separating the dimerized phase from the N{\' e}el phase. The critical behavior of the total and single-particle static transverse structure factors is also studied by series expansion methods and found to conform with theoretical expectations. The Heisenberg spin-Peierls model with dispersive, gapless phonons is studied with Density Matrix Renormalization Group methods. We investigate the zero temperature properties of the model using the crossover method. The calculations were found to converge poorly and no conclusive results could be found using this method. An analysis of the convergence problems and the discovery of an anomalous triplet ground state is presented in this chapter.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spin</field><field name="subject">antiferromagnet</field><field name="subject">Heisenberg</field><field name="subject">Peierls</field><field name="subject">condensed</field><field name="subject">matter</field><field name="subject">physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An immunologically inspired self-set for sensor networks</field><field name="creator">Bokareva, Tatiana, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), consisting of many small sensing devices working in concert, have the potential to revolutionise every aspect of our lives. Although the technology is still in its infancy offers an unlimited number of possible applications, ranging from military surveillance to environmental monitoring. These WSNs are prone to physical sensor failures due to environmental conditions such bio fouling and an adverse ambient environment, as well as threats that arise from their operation in an open environment. Consequently, reliability and fault-tolerance techniques become a critical aspect of the research associated with WSNs. In mission critical applications, such as the monitoring of enemy troops, unreliable or faulty information produced by WSNs could potentially lead to fatal outcomes. In such applications, it necessary to receive both a correct notification of event occurrences and uncorrupted data. Developing a fault-tolerance system for WSNs is a challenging task. New self-configuration, self-recognition and self-organisation techniques are needed due to unique aspects of the operation of WSNs. Our current understanding of WSNs leads to an immunologically inspired solution to the design of a fault-tolerant network. One of the main roles of the Natural Immune System(NIS) is the recognition of self and the elimination of non-self proteins. Hence, in order to have an immune system equivalent for a sensor network, we must have a clear and stable definition of what constitutes the Self and the Non-Self Sets in a sensor network. This thesis explores two different approaches to modelling, collection and representation of the Self-Set in distributed sensor networks. We approach this problem, of identifying what constitutes the Self-Set in terms of sensor readings, using pattern recognition techniques from the machine learning field that leverages a small number of past observations of sensor nodes. We have chosen Competitive Learning Neural Network (CLNN) for the construction of the Self-Set. We define and evaluate two approaches for the aggregation of the Self-Set across multiple sensors in a WSN. The first approach is the Graph Theory Based Aggregation (GTBA) which consists of two main parts, namely: classification of the sensor readings by means of CLNN, which provides the multimodal view data and GTBA of the CLNN output, which takes intersections of intervals produced by CLNN. In this thesis we define and evaluate two different interpretations of GTBA, namely: Midpoint Intersection (MPI): one that considers the midpoint of intervals. Midpoint Free Intersection (MFI): one that does not take the midpoints into account but assigns the confidence levels to each of the resulted intersections. We evaluated both interpretations on three different types of phenomena and have shown that the second interpretation, MFI, consistently produced more precise representations of the environment under observation. However, MFI produced a very strict representation of the phenomenon, which consequently led to a large number of systems' retraining. Hence, we defined and evaluated a technique which produced a more relaxed representation of the Self-Set and at the same time preserved the finer variation in the phenomenon. The second approach is based on unsupervised learning. We define and evaluate three related unsupervised learning procedures ?? Divergence and Merging (DMP), Suboptimal Clustering (SOC), and Simple Clustering (SC) for the collection of the Self-Set. We explore the design tradeoffs in unsupervised learning schemes with respect to the clustering quality. We implement and evaluate these related unsupervised learning procedures on a realworld data set. The outcome of these experiments show that, out of the three unsupervised learning procedures studied in this thesis, the Suboptimal Clustering procedure appears to be the most suitable for the classification of sensor readings, provided that the amount of free memory is large enough to store and recluster an entire training set. We evaluate aggregation of the Self-Set produced by means of the distributed implementation of the unsupervised learning procedures. The aggregation is based on extended unsupervised learning and we evaluate the possibilities of the autonomous retraining of the system. Our experiments show that, in a naturally slowly changing environment, 40% of nodes reporting deviations is a large enough number to reinitialise the retraining of the system. The final conclusion is that it is possible to have a distributed implementation of the unsupervised procedure that  produces an almost identical representation of the environment, which  makes unsupervised learning suitable for a large number of sensor network architectures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Self-set</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultra-tight integration of GPS/Pseudolites/INS: system design and performance analysis</field><field name="creator">Swarna, Ravindra Babu, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The complementary advantages of GPS and INS have been the principle driving factor to integrate these two navigation systems as an integrated GPS/INS system in various architectural forms to provide robust positioning.  Although the loosely coupled and tightly coupled GPS/INS systems have been in existence for over a decade or two and performed reasonably well, nevertheless, the tracking performance was still a concern in non-benign environments such as dynamic scenarios, indoor environments, urban areas, under foliages etc., where the GPS tracking loops lose lock due to the signals being weak, subjected to excessive dynamics or completely blocked.  The motivation of this research, therefore, was to address these limitations with an integrated GPS/Pseudolite/INS system using ultra-tight integration architecture.  The main research contributions are summarised as below:  (a)	The performance of the tracking loops in dynamic scenarios were analysed in detail with both conventional and ultra-tight software receivers.  The stochastic modelling of the INS-derived Doppler is of utmost importantance in enhancing the benefits of ultra-tight integration, and therefore, two popular stochastic techniques??? Gauss Markov (GM) and Autoregressive (AR), were investigated to model the Doppler signal.  The simulation results demonstrate that the AR method is capable of producing better accuracies and is more efficient.  The algorithms to determine the AR parameters (order and coefficients) were also provided.  (b)	The various mathematical relationships that elicit the understanding of the ultra-tightly integrated system were derived in detail.  The Kalman filter design and its implementation were also provided.  Various simulation and real-time experiments were conducted to study the performance of the filter, and the results confirm the underlying assumptions in the theoretical analyses and the mathematical derivations.  Covariance analysis was also performed to study the convergence and stability effects of the filter.   (c)	Interpolator design using signal processing techniques were proposed to increase the sampling rate of the INS-derived Doppler.  To efficiently realise the interpolator transfer function, two optimal techniques were investigated ??? Polyphase and Cascaded Integrator Comb (CIC), and our results show that CIC was more efficient than polyphase in accuracy and real-time implementations.  (d)	 The integration of Pseudolites (PL) with INS in ultra-tight configuration was analysed for an indoor environment.  The acquisition and tracking performances of ???Pseudolites-only??? and ???Pseudolite/INS??? modes were compared to study the impact of the inertial signals aiding.  The results demonstrate that aiding of the inertial signals with the baseband loops (acquisition and tracking) improve the overall tracking performance.  An overview on the effects of the pseudolite signal propagation is also given.  (e)	Simulation and real-time experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms and the overall design of the ultra-tightly integrated system.  A comparison was also done between GPS/PL/INS and GPS/INS integrated systems to study the potential advantages of the pseudolite integration.  The details of the field experiment are provided. The data from a real-time experiment was processed to further evaluate the robustness of the system.  The results confirm that the developed mathematical models and algorithms are correct.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kalman filter</field><field name="subject">GPS, INS, Pseudolites,</field><field name="subject">High dynamics, Receiver tracking loops</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40075</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of MNEs in shaping the institutional environment of the host country</field><field name="creator">Kim, Joseph Hyosup, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Rapid advancement in technology and increased trade across national borders led to an international trend towards valuing technology and knowledge-based assets.

This PhD research aimed to: 1) quantify the magnitude of child passenger injuries in New South Wales (NSW), Australia; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of different restraint use to prevent fatalities among child passengers; and 3) estimate the benefit in the general child population from different intervention targets relating to restraint use. It comprised two studies to validate methodology and four independent epidemiological studies. The first study to validate methodology assessed the data item availability and categorization across different road traffic injury surveillance data collections in NSW in relation to World Health Organization recommended data item lists and necessary data item lists for road traffic injury research. Exclusion of, or insufficient categorization of, crucial data items such as restraint use and injurious outcome existed for each data collection. The other study to validate methodology assessed the performance (in terms of incidence estimates, sensitivity, and specificity) of several methods for removing multiple counting when conducting analyses on hospital separation data for child passenger injuries under either primary-diagnosis or all-diagnoses based injury definition, using linkage methods as a comparison. The "readmission"-based criterion consistently best approximated the linkage-method-derived incidence rate. Two epidemiological studies used NSW hospital separation datasets and quantified the magnitude of child road trauma in NSW in terms of hospitalisation rates. One study examined the trend in hospitalised injury incidence rates during the period of July 1998 to June 2005 using a non-parametric estimation method, and reported a non-significant decline of hospitalised injuries to child passengers over time. The second study used Poisson regression to demonstrate that rural NSW children were two times more likely to suffer hospitalised injuries compared with their urban counterparts. The third epidemiological study used the Fatality Analysis Reporting Systems (FARS) from the United States (US) and estimated the association between different restraint uses and child passenger fatality using a matched cohort method. Improperly using restraints significantly elevated the risk of death for child passengers involved in a crash compared to any other restraint use. The advantage of child restraints over seat belts in terms of fatality reduction was not statistically significant, although previous studies have shown an advantage for serious injury reduction. The last study was performed to quantify the relative public health benefit in terms of reduction in child passenger deaths and injuries for different interventions relating to restraint use in the general population using a case-based population attributable risk fraction method. Results support the ongoing child restraint legislation change in Australia to require compulsory child restraint uses for children up to their 7th birthday, and an increasing proper use of age-appropriate restraints would provide the greatest reduction in fatalities and injuries among child passengers assuming equal population uptake for all interventions.  In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that child road trauma remains a public health burden to the Australian community; and highlights the importance of properly using age-appropriate restraints in preventing injuries to child passengers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Car passengers.</field><field name="subject">Child.</field><field name="subject">Road traffic injuries.</field><field name="subject">Restraints.</field><field name="subject">Motor vehicle.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turbo-generator responses due to the Alford force, the steam excitation force and the dominant unbalanced magnetic pull</field><field name="creator">Cai, Zhemin, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In turbomachinery, extra excitation forces may result from non-idealised operation conditions and may sometime cause excessive vibrations and unsteady rotor motions. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the effects of such excitation forces.  The extra excitation forces investigated here are the Thomas/Alford force due to the blade tip clearance change, the steam excitation force caused by the variation of inlet steam speed and state blade trailing wake and the dominant magnetic pull force due to dynamic eccentricity of the rotor. The main research results in this thesis include: (1)	The modelling of the Jeffcott rotor and the 600MW steam-turbine generator. The used in-house ??transient?? program can only handle the circular short bearings with the modified short bearing method while the simulated steam-turbine should be supported by tilting pad bearings. The first critical speeds of systems supported by tilting pad bearings are more approaching to the lab data for all four rotor models while that of journal bearing supported systems are normally lower than the real operating critical speed. (2)	Applying three sorts of excitation forces into the single-stage rotor-bearing system. The numerical simulation shows that for the model with each single excitation force, all of these three forces need to reach some limit to force the system into the unsteady state. For all the three forces, higher limits are needed if the machine runs at lower running speeds. Furthermore, unbalance loading also can influence the system behaviours. As the unbalance increases, the system will still stay steady while the spectra become noisier, though the amplitude still low comparing to harmonics.  (3)	Combing three types of excitation forces into the assembled rotor-bearing system. The numerical simulation shows that the assembled system presents similar vibration responses as the single stage rotor-bearing system. Furthermore, these three forces cannot cancel each other and the combination will unstabilise the system. Meanwhile, the influence of the dominant magnetic pull force is less than other two forces.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dominant magnetic pull force</field><field name="subject">Thomas/Alford Force</field><field name="subject">Steam excitation force</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43544</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The (Un) Balancing Act: The impact of culture on women engineering students' gendered and professional identities</field><field name="creator">Powell, Abigail , Social Policy Research Centre, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the impact of the engineering culture on women engineering students??? gendered and professional identities. It is simultaneously focused on exploring how identity shapes, and is shaped by, women???s experiences of the engineering culture and, the relationship between gendered and professional  identities.  The research is set within the context of existing research on women in engineering, much of which has focused either on women???s experiences in industry or experiences of staff in academia, failing to recognise the importance of higher education (HE) as a gatekeeper to the engineering professions. Furthermore, despite numerous initiatives aimed at increasing the percentage of women entering engineering, the proportion of women studying engineering has remained stable, around fifteen percent, for the last few years.  The research is grounded in an interpretivist approach, although it adopts a multimethod research design. Specifically it draws upon qualitative interviews with 43 women and 18 men engineering students, a questionnaire with responses from 656 engineering undergraduates and two focus groups with 13 women engineering students from seven departments at one university. These datasets are analysed with the aid of NVivo and SPSS to explore women engineering students??? career choices; women???s experiences of the HE engineering culture; the relationship between engineering education culture and women???s identities; whether there are cultural nuances between engineering disciplines; and, implications for strategies to attract  and retain more women in engineering. Key findings from the research are that women and men make career choices based on similar factors, including the influence of socialisers, knowledge of the engineering professions, skills, ability and attributes, and career rewards. However, the extent to which each of this factors are important is gendered. The research also highlights key characteristics of the HE engineering culture, including competition, camaraderie, gendered humour, intensity, more theoretical than practical, help and support for women students and reinforcement of gender binaries. These findings all suggest that women are assimilated into the engineering culture or, at least, develop coping mechanisms for surviving in the existing culture. These strategies reveal a complex and difficult balancing act between being a woman and being an engineer by claiming a rightful place as an engineer, denying gendered experiences and becoming critical of  other women. The research also tackles two key issues, rarely discussed in the  extant literature. Firstly the help and support women students receive from lecturers  and other staff, and the negative impact this has, and may continue to have, on women. Secondly, the analysis of discipline differences shows that design and technology is significantly different from other engineering disciplines in terms of culture(s) and women???s experiences.  The thesis concludes that women???s enculturation into engineering results in  their ???doing gender??? in a particular way. This means that women???s implicit and explicit  devaluing and rejection of femaleness, fails to challenge the gendered cultures of  engineering and, in many ways, upholds an environment which is hostile to women.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">engineering</field><field name="subject">career choice</field><field name="subject">culture</field><field name="subject">gender</field><field name="subject">higher education</field><field name="subject">identity</field><field name="subject">professionalisation</field><field name="subject">women</field><field name="subject">mixed methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantitative microbial risk assessment: a catchment management tool to delineate buffer distances for on-site sewage treatment and disposal systems in Sydney??s drinking water catchments</field><field name="creator">Charles, Katrina, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">On-site sewage systems, such as septic tank-absorption trenches, are used by approximately 20 000 people who live within the catchments that supply Sydney??s drinking water. These systems discharge sewage, treated to varying degrees depending on the system type and level of maintenance, to the environment. This can result in contamination of drinking water supplies if systems are not designed or managed appropriately. The aim of the project was to develop a methodology to define appropriate buffer distances between on-site sewage systems and waterways in Sydney??s drinking water catchments, to ensure the protection of drinking water quality. Specific objectives included: identifying the current status of on-site sewage management; assessing the effluent quality and treatment performance of septic tanks, aerated wastewater treatment systems (AWTS) with disinfection and an amended material sand mound; and development of an appropriate methodology for delineating buffer distances and assessing development applications. Viruses were used as a focus for delineating the buffer distances due to their mobility and robustness in the environment, and the potential health consequences of their presence in drinking water. A Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) model was developed to calculate the cumulative impact of the on-site sewage systems in the Warragamba catchment based on data from literature and experiments, with consideration of virus loads from sewage treatment plants within the catchments. The model enabled consideration of what was a tolerable impact in terms of the resulting infections within the community. The QMRA the tolerable loads of viruses from the Warragamba catchment were 108 viruses per year in raw water and 104 viruses per year in treated water. A log reduction method was developed to facilitate individual site development assessments. This method was compared to other management approaches to development assessment: fixed minimum buffer distances of 100m, reducing failure rates to zero, and the use of a preferred system. Each of these methods had a limit for how much they could reduce virus loads to the catchment due to either failure or short buffer distances at some sites. While the log reduction method is limited by the failure rates, the method provides a quantitative measure of risk by which maintenance inspections can be prioritised.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">buffer</field><field name="subject">septic tank</field><field name="subject">virus</field><field name="subject">catchment</field><field name="subject">onsite sewage system</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modafinil for psychostimulant dependence</field><field name="creator">Shearer, James Douglas, National Drug &amp; Alcohol Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Psychostimulant dependence is a major public health issue in many parts of the world associated with a wide range of psychological, medical and social problems.  Psychosocial interventions are the mainstay of treatment for psychostimulant problems, although their effectiveness is compromised by poor uptake and compliance. Despite increasing knowledge of the neurobiological consequences of psychostimulant use, no medications to date have been any more successful than placebo in reducing psychostimulant use in dependent patients.  Modafinil is a non-amphetamine type psychostimulant that may have potential as an agonist pharmacotherapy for psychostimulant dependence.  The aim of this thesis was to examine the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of modafinil 200 mg/day over ten weeks plus a four session brief CBT intervention for methamphetamine and cocaine dependence through two concurrent randomised placebo controlled trials.  There were no statistically significant differences between modafinil and placebo in treatment retention, medication adherence, psychostimulant abstinence, psychostimulant craving or severity of psychostimulant dependence.  Methamphetamine-dependent subjects tended to provide more illicit psychostimulant negative urine samples while in treatment than those who received placebo.   There appeared to be a reduction in self-reported days of psychostimulant use among methamphetamine-dependent subjects who received modafinil compared to placebo, but the effect size was too small to be statistically significant in this sample.  The reduction in self-reported psychostimulant use did reach statistical significance in methamphetamine-dependent subjects with no other substance dependence.    Uptake of counselling was the most significant predictor of reduced psychostimulant use post treatment, and the addition of counselling improved the cost-effectiveness of modafinil relative to placebo.    Modafinil appeared to be safe, well-tolerated, and non-reinforcing in this treatment population.  Compared to placebo, there was a significant increase in weight in subjects who completed the 10-week course of treatment, and a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure in methamphetamine-dependent subjects who received modafinil.      The results support further trials of modafinil in methamphetamine-dependent patients, although future trials in cocaine-dependent patients from this treatment population were not likely to be viable.  Modafinil appeared to be modestly effective in reducing, but not stopping, methamphetamine use in selected patients.  Multi-centre trials with larger sample sizes, and measures sensitive enough to detect quantitative changes in psychostimulant use would be needed to confirm the findings.  Blood pressure and weight may be important indicators of clinical outcome, and warrant particular attention in future trials, particularly given the cardio-toxicity of both methamphetamine and cocaine. Strategies to enhance medication adherence including a higher dose and counselling adherence are recommended to improve outcomes.  Given the predominance of behavioural and psychosocial factors in psychostimulant dependence, it is likely that the role of medications such as modafinil will be as an adjunct to psychosocial therapy.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharmacotherapy</field><field name="subject">Modafinil</field><field name="subject">Psychostimulant dependence</field><field name="subject">Psychopharmacology</field><field name="subject">Mental illness</field><field name="subject">Psychotropic drugs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41423</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the credit default swap market</field><field name="creator">Wang, Peipei, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The focus of this dissertation is the European Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) market. CDSs are the most popular credit derivative products. Three issues are discussed, the first, which is covered in chapter 2, is the investigation of non-diversifiable jump risk in iTraxx sector indices based on a multivariate model that explicitly admits discrete common jumps for an index and its components. Our empirical research shows that both the iTraxx Non-Financials and their components experience jumps during the sample period, which means that the jump risks in the iTraxx sector index are not diversifiable. The second issue, which is covered in chapter 3 is the component structure of credit default swap spreads and their determinants. We firstly extract a transitory component and a persistent component from two different maturities of the Markit iTraxx index and then regress these components against proxies for several commonly used explanatory variables. Our results show that these explanatory variables have significant but differing impacts on the extracted components, which indicates that a two-factor formulation may be needed to model CDS options.  The last issue, which is covered in chapters 4, 5 and 6 is the investigation of the linkage between the credit default swap market and the equity market within the European area. We innovatively calibrate the CDS option with the Heston Model to get the implied volatility in the CDS market, which allows us to investigate both the characteristic of implied volatility in the CDS market and the relationship of the two markets not only on the level of daily changes but also with regard to its second moment.  Our analysis shows that the stock market weakly leads the CDS market on daily changes but for implied volatility, the stock market leads the CDS market. A VECM analysis shows that only the stock market contributes to price discovery. For sub-investment grade entities, the interactivities between the implied volatility of the CDS market and the implied volatility of the stock market are stronger, especially during the recent credit crunch period.  All these results have important implications for the construction of portfolios with credit-sensitive instruments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jump risk.</field><field name="subject">Credit default swap.</field><field name="subject">Kalman filter.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43722</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supply chain competition</field><field name="creator">Bao, Yong, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the influence of horizontal competition on supply chain performance. Unlike most of the existing literature which focuses on horizontal competition between echelon levels, we look at both the supply chain and the individual company??s performance with the presence of supply chain to supply chain competition.  Specifically, this thesis is composed of three individual research papers.  The first paper deals with chain-to-chain horizontal competition and considers price competition among an arbitrary number of supply chains by comparing two cases. In the first case each supply chain is vertically integrated, while in the second, decentralised, case the manufacturers and retailers act independently. We explore the effect of varying the level of price competition on the profitts of the industry participants and demonstrate the important role played by the spread of underlying market shares. The coefficient of variation of these market shares determines whether decentralised supply chains can outperform integrated supply chains with an appropriate level of competition.  The second and third papers focus on in-chain horizontal competition with capacity constraints. In the second paper, we look at a supply chain with one manufacturer and two downstream retailers. Based on total capacity available, the manufacturer needs to find ways to best use the capacity by determining whether or not to release the capacity information to retailers.  The third paper looks at competition in a more complicated supply chain structure. A retailer buys three brands of products from two manufacturers. One manufacturer produces both branded and private label products, and the other one manufactures a branded product only. With our model, we are able to determine the profits of each supply chain agent. At the end of the paper, we use data from the Australian milk industry and discuss a problem in which a manufacturer needs to decide how to allocate capacity between the national brand and the private label when there is a capacity shortage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Horizontial competition</field><field name="subject">Supply chain management</field><field name="subject">Capacity competition</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring spirituality in feminist practices - emerging knowledge for social work</field><field name="creator">Coholic, Diana, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research study investigates self-identified feminist social workers??? conceptualizations of spirituality, how spirituality influences their practices, and their ideas about the effects of spiritually influenced practice. There is increasing interest in exploring and considering spirituality across social work approaches, accompanied by a strong demand for empirical research and the development of knowledge in this area. The past few years in particular have witnessed an expanding social work literature that discusses the incorporation of spirituality into practice. In this thesis spirituality refers to a complex construct that can be deeply personal and/or communal, and that can encompass a sense of connection with something bigger that transcends ordinary life experience. In order to examine spirituality in the context of feminist social work practice, the goals of this study needed to be exploratory and demanded the use of a qualitative methodology. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with twenty experienced direct practice social workers. Grounded theory analysis of the interview data uncovered surprising and significant convergences amongst research participants??? beliefs, values and practices. These unexpected commonalities invited a further analysis of the data that produced a set of practice principles. These practice principles reflected the participants??? understandings of spirituality and basic values, their ideas about processes of spiritual development and beliefs about the spiritual essence of human life, and their spiritually influenced practice methods and relationships. The process of developing practice principles included further data collection through the written feedback of participants and the use of three focus groups. This second round of data collection and analysis extended and refined the practice principles. The practice principles are particularly relevant for social work because they are based in the participants??? collective practice wisdom and represent an important step towards helping to legitimize spiritual knowledge. The practice principles also have important implications for social work practice, education and research in that they can promote discussions about spirituality, guide practice, provide a base for the future development of spiritually influenced models and frameworks, and direct curriculum development.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spirituality</field><field name="subject">feminist practices</field><field name="subject">feminists</field><field name="subject">religious life</field><field name="subject">social service</field><field name="subject">religious aspects</field><field name="subject">social workers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17873</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutions, education inequality and dynamics of institutional reform</field><field name="creator">Najeeb, Khaqan Hassan, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of four studies on the role of institutions, education and institutional reform in economic development. Three of the studies examine empirical aspects of the issue and the fourth provides an analysis of policy implications. A key theme of the dissertation is the recognition that institutions, both formal and informal, are important for development. The observation that some developing economies have been unable to substantively improve institutional structures, creates a vital agenda for studying institutional change. The first study empirically investigates the impact of education, both quantitatively and qualitatively, on the informal institution of social capital measured as social trust. Differences in levels of education are considered to find the separate effects of primary, secondary and tertiary education. The relationship between education and social trust levels in countries is found to be positive. The sample is further split into developed and developing countries which also substantiates the main hypothesis. The results can be interpreted as schooling playing a transformative role in the society. The second study develops a framework for studying education inequality and institutional development. A range of economic, political and social measures of institutional quality are used in a cross-country analysis. The study confirms that the cross-country differences in institutional variables are influenced negatively by the education inequality. Several competing hypotheses of institutional improvement are used to test the sensitivity of the results. The sample is further split into OECD and non-OECD countries, with no new results arising from this split. The third study investigates the relationship of education inequality and institutional quality using panel data techniques and an alternative data set of institutional measures, than the one used in the second study. This study initially estimates the relationship using the pooled OLS and fixed effects models. The issue of persistency in institutional variables is then investigated by using a system GMM estimator. The evidence suggests that the impact of reducing education inequality is associated with improvements in institutional quality. The fourth study analyses the implications from the first three studies with reference to the institutional reform agenda. Insight is given for improving the reform process. Areas of context specificity and sequencing of reforms are dealt with, using country examples. The intuition from this essay is that educational equality is a deliberate initiative which needs to be carried out through policy initiatives, although the process adopted would depend on the specific economy. It is suggested that there is a need to change the fundamental focus from emphasis on altering formal rules, to considering the current underlying structures in societies as a constraint, in developing a way forward to improving the reform agenda.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Institutions</field><field name="subject">Education inequality</field><field name="subject">Reform</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An XML-based framework for electronic business document integration with relational databases</field><field name="creator">Shamsedin Tekieh, Razieh Sadat, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are becoming  increasingly  engaged in  B2B interactions. The ubiquitousness of the Internet and the quasi-reliance on electronic  document exchanges with larger trading partners have fostered this move. The main  technical challenge that this brings to SMEs is that of business document integration:  they  need  to  exchange  business  documents  with  heterogeneous  document  formats and also integrate these documents with internal information systems. Often they can not  afford  using  expensive,  customized  and  proprietary  solutions  for  document exchange and storage. Rather they need cost-effective approaches designed based on open standards and backed with easy-to-use information systems.  In this dissertation, we investigate the problem of business document integration for  SMEs  following  a  design  science  methodology.  We  propose  a  framework  and conceptual  architecture  for  a  business  document  integration  system  (BDIS).  By  studying existing business document formats, we recommend using the  GS1 XML standard  format  as  the  intermediate  format  for  business  documents  in  BDIS.  The GS1 standards are widely used in supply chains and logistics globally.  We present an architecture for BDIS consisting of two layers: one for the design of internal information system based on relational databases, capable of storing XML business documents, and the other enabling the exchange of heterogeneous business documents  at  runtime.  For  the  design  layer,  we  leverage  existing  XML  schema conversion  approaches,  and  extend  them,  to  propose  a  customized  and  novel approach for converting GS1 XML document schemas into relational schemas. For the runtime  layer,  we  propose  wrappers  as  architectural  components  for  the conversion of various electronic documents formats into the GS1 XML format.  We demonstrate our approach through a case study involving a GS1 XML business document.  We  have  implemented  a  prototype  BDIS.  We  have  evaluated  and compared  it  with  existing  research  and  commercial  tools  for  XML  to  relational schema  conversion.  The  results  show  that  it  generates  operational  and  simpler relational schemas for GS1 XML documents. In conclusion, the proposed framework enables SMEs to engage effectively in electronic business.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SMEs.</field><field name="subject">B2B integration.</field><field name="subject">XML schema.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sexual behaviour of international backpackers in the context of travel in Australia</field><field name="creator">Egan, Caroline Elizabeth, National Centre in HIV Social Research, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is the first to collect detailed empirical data on sexual practice among backpackers while exploring the material and social context of backpacking using an ethnographic framework. The theoretical concepts of liminality and sexual scripts were drawn on to analyse the findings. Backpackers were recruited from hostels in Sydney and Cairns; 559 backpackers (243 women, 316 men) completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. In addition, 25 in-depth one-to-one interviews with backpackers and 25 semi-structured interviews were conducted with sexual health and travel clinic staff and hostel service providers. Participant and non-participant observation in backpacker hostels also informed the analysis.  Drinking alcohol, often to excess, was central to the backpacking setting and was both a reason for and a post-facto justification of unprotected sex. The backpacking setting encouraged transient liaisons. More than half (55%) of backpackers had sex with someone new during their trip and for 71% of them it was with someone that they had just met that day. Twenty-five per cent of those with no expectations to have casual sex on their trip and 22% of those with no previous experience of casual sex had casual sex during their trip. More than half (53%) of those who had sex with a someone new did so while other people were in the room. Only 55% always used a condom with their last new partner. While most backpackers carried condoms and intended to use them, unprotected sex was common. Perception of risk was low: 78% of those who did not use a condom the last time they had casual sex on the trip perceived their risk of getting HIV to be ??low?? to ??nil??. Three participants acquired HIV during their trip. The culture of backpacking encourages more sexually permissive attitudes but does not encourage condom use, especially for those who did not consistently use condoms at home. These findings highlight the need for more broad-based dissemination of information on STIs to young people, and for future sexual health campaigns to specifically target backpackers in the context in which they travel.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Backpackers</field><field name="subject">Sex</field><field name="subject">Travel</field><field name="subject">Sexual risk</field><field name="subject">Sexual health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Owned by Nobody' : Health Status and its Determinants Among New South Wales Prisoners</field><field name="creator">Butler, Tony, School of Community Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">OBJECTIVES The overall aim of the project were to conduct a survey of the physical and mental health status of prisoners in New South Wales (NSW). A more specific aim, which is addressed in this PhD, was to analyse in detail a number of key health areas which have particular relevance to prisoner populations namely: tuberculosis, viral hepatitis, herpes simplex type 2 virus, childhood sexual abuse (CSA), and drug and alcohol use.  METHODS A cross-sectional, random sample of prisoners, stratified by sex, age and Aboriginality was chosen from 27 correctional centres (24 male and 3 female) in NSW in 1996. Screening was conducted by nurses from within the correctional health system.  A detailed face-to-face interview was used to collect self-reported information on a range of physical and mental health characteristics, and behavioural issues. The physical health component covered chronic illness, recent symptoms, health services utilisation, medications, and self assessed health status. Mental health issues which were covered included: suicide attempts, self-harm, prior mental illness and psychiatric medication. Standardised screening instruments were used to test for depression, hopelessness and suicidal intent. Behavioural factors sought were drug and alcohol use, gambling, and sexual abuse. Blood samples were taken to screen for a range of infectious diseases and health indicators. These included HIV, syphilis, herpes simplex  type-2 virus, rubella, chlamydia, and hepatitis (B, C, and G). A Mantoux skin test was performed to screen for tuberculosis infection. Hearing was assessed using otoacoustic emissions.   RESULTS A total of 789 inmates (657 males and 132 females), including 235 Aboriginal people were screened, representing approximately 11% of males and 40% of females in full-time incarceration. For the key areas examined in the chapters we found: Overall health status ????	Overall health status was poor compared with the NSW general population in regard to self-reported chronic illness, recent health complaints, and well-being. Hospitalisation was less frequent in male prisoners than general community males but higher in female prisoners for mental health problems compared with community females. Tuberculosis ????	No previously undetected cases of tuberculosis were found; however, Mantoux positivity was higher in Aboriginal and overseas born prisoners. Viral hepatitis ????	Markers for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis G were significantly more common in the NSW prisoner population than in the general community. Significant disparities were found between prisoners???? self-report of past exposure to hepatitis (B and C) and their serostatus. Thirty five percent of inmates who were hepatitis C antibody positive believed that they were negative, and for hepatitis B, 72% of positives reported they were negative. Multivariate analysis identified Aboriginality, long-term injecting, and injecting while in prison as risk factors for HBV. Risk factors for exposure to HCV were female sex, non-Aboriginality, history of childhood institutionalisation, and injecting-related behaviours. For HGV, female sex, and previous imprisonment were significant risk factors but injecting was not; being aged 25-39 years was associated with a decreased risk for HGV as compared to younger and older inmates.  Herpes simplex virus type 2 ????	The prevalence of HSV-2 antibodies in this prisoner population was similar to that observed in NSW STD clinic attendees, and was higher in females than males. Exposure was related to: increasing age and Aboriginality for men, and higher reported number of lifetime sexual partners and the presence of hepatitis C antibodies for women. Few prisoners (1%) reported a previous diagnosis of genital herpes. Childhood sexual abuse ????	The prevalence of self-reported childhood sexual abuse was higher in females than males, and similar to that observed in clinical populations. There was an association between CSA and mental health outcomes, including a history of psychiatric treatment and suicide attempts. Male survivors of CSA were more likely to report self-harm, depression, and involvement in violent relationships. Both men and women with a history of CSA were more likely to report having a sexually transmissible disease (STD). Females exposed to CSA were more likely to report subsequent abusive adult relationships involving physical assault, sexual assault, and verbal abuse. Drug use ????	Overall, 64% of prisoners had used illicit drugs at some time in the past with cannabis (males 56%, females 63%) and heroin (males 29%, females 49%) being the most common. Forty four percent of prisoners had a history of injecting drug use, with injecting prevalence significantly higher in females than males (64% vs. 40%). Half of male and female injectors had done so while in prison. Harmful or hazardous use of alcohol was associated with imprisonment for violent crimes, whereas opiate and methadone use were associated with non-violent crimes. Sixty two percent of property offenders had an injecting history. Alcohol intoxication at the time of offending was associated with imprisonment for homicides and assaults. Males were more likely than females to seek treatment in prison for drug problems. IMPLICATIONS Prisoners in NSW have a number of special health needs which are evidenced in the high levels of infectious diseases (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis G, and herpes simplex virus type 2) and exposure to factors (childhood sexual abuse and alcohol and drug use) with a clear relationship to adverse health outcomes. Prisons represent an opportunity for public health interventions to address some of the health problems identified in this study. Potentially valuable programmes include education to prevent the spread of blood borne communicable diseases and STDs, immunisation for vaccine preventable diseases such as hepatitis B, and treatment to alleviate the effects of drug use and childhood sexual abuse. In the case of prison drug use the prison environment itself presents a threat to health in that sterile injecting equipment is not available to prisoners despite evidence that injecting in prison is widespread. The challenge for prison health planners is twofold: to make maximum use of the window of opportunity to improve the health status of this group, and to provide a continuum of care between the community and prison.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prisoners</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A way forward: an indicator system for eco-industrial parks in China</field><field name="creator">Ou, Yuning, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under the background of worldwide transition towards sustainability, Chinese government has begun to advocate nationwide sustainable-industrialization through initiating Eco-industrial Parks (EIPs) since last decade. While EIP projects are widely carried out by both central and local governments, the standards for EIP planning and management promulgated in China are considered to be inefficient and incomprehensive in this study. Due to the challenge of economy-environment conflict China confronts and the consequent narrow definition of China's EIPs which focuses mainly on environmental performance, a main limitation of the standards is the unbalanced considerations between the three basic foundations of sustainable development (SD) concept - economic growth, social development, and environmental protection and restoration.  By reviewing several leading assessment tools being used internationally, as well as analyzing the specific issues existing during industrial development in China, this research intends to develop a synthetic and advanced indicator system, to evaluate China&#146;s EIP performance. This system comprises 34 indicators that integrate four broad aspects of 'economic development', 'social development', 'environmental management', and 'administration'. For each indicator, detailed measurement and criterion are proposed for evaluation and implementation. Additionally, a case study of Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Area (TEDA), a certificated EIP, is conducted to illustrate the application of this assessment system.  The proposed indicator system is supposed to fill in the gap in EIP performance evaluation in China, from a view of the internationally perceived understandings of EIP and SD concepts. Although future studies are still needed to test and improve its feasibility and accuracy in terms of both indicator selection and criteria setting, this system provides a generic framework for EIP assessment work in China and is expected to drive China's EIP movement towards a more sustainable approach.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Eco-industrial Park</field><field name="subject">Indicator system</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regulation and function of the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors (LILRS) in rheumatoid arthritis</field><field name="creator">Huynh, Owen Anthony, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptors (LILRs) are a family of receptors that is broadly expressed on all leukocytes and have the ability to regulate their function. A substantial amount of evidence suggests that LILRs may be involved in immune homeostasis but also immune dysregulation. We therefore studied the role of LILRs in relation to the autoimmune disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disease involving inflammation of the joints affecting the synovial membrane, cartilage and bone. Much of the tissue damage is a result of an inappropriate immune response within the joint space caused by the unwarranted activation of leukocytes. Here were report that LILRA2 (an activating receptor) that has been previously shown to be highly expressed in the rheumatoid synovium, induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#945;, IL-1, IL-6, IFN-&#947; and IL-10 in primary monocytes. These cytokines are known to have an important role in the pathogenesis of RA indicating a pathway by which LILRA2 exacerbates RA. Co-ligation of LILRB4 (an inhibitory receptor) with LILRA2 abolishes cytokine production suggesting that LILRB4 is able to suppress the function of LILRA2. Expression of both LILRA2 and LILRB4 are regulated by inflammatory cytokines and LPS, indicative of a feedback mechanism. There is also cross-talk between LILRs and TLR4 as co-stimulation with LPS and either LILRA2 or LILRB4 inhibits cytokine production. A differential expression of LILRs has also been identified on lymphocytes of patients with RA whereby an increase of LILRA1 (activating) and LILRB1 (inhibitory) expressing circulating lymphocytes is present in RA patients when compared to healthy control subjects. From these studies, we propose that LILRs have a functional role in RA by regulating local and systemic inflammation. The presence of LILRA2 in the RA joint is detrimental since its potent ability to induce inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-&#945;, can initiate leukocyte recruitment and activation of proteases. Along with TLR4, LILRA2 and LILRB4 have the potential to moderate the innate immune system via regulation of cytokine production. Furthermore, suppression of LILRA2 function may serve as a therapeutic tool in many inflammatory diseases.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rheumatoid Arthritis</field><field name="subject">Immune Regulation</field><field name="subject">Leukocyte Immunoglobulin-like Receptors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Markers of nutritional assessment in children with gastrointestinal illnesses</field><field name="creator">Aurangzeb, Brekhna, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract  Nutritional status affects every aspect of a child?s health. Thorough nutritional assessment is hampered by the lack of a single comprehensive tool, which can cover all aspects of nutritional assessment. In three distinct studies, this thesis investigated the nutritional status of hospitalised children, children with coeliac disease and children with inflammatory bowel disease. Study 1 The objectives of this study were to assess prevalence of malnutrition and nutritional risk, and define demographic and anthropometric factors associated with nutritional risk among hospitalized children. In this cross sectional study, 157 hospitalised children were assessed for nutritional status using nutritional risk score (NRS) and anthropometric measurements. We found that 4.5%, 8.9%, 15.1% and 10.4% children were wasted, stunted, overweight and obese respectively. However, with the NRS, 47.8% of the children were at high nutritional risk. These children at high risk had lower weight for age (p=0.02), lower BMI percentiles for age (p=0.001) and longer hospitalization (p=0.001) than children at no risk. Study 2 The objectives of this study were to determine nutritional parameters in children with coeliac disease. Twenty-five children with coeliac disease and an equal number of age and gender matched controls were enrolled and anthropometric measurements, BIA and leptin levels were analysed in all. No significant differences were found between the children with coeliac disease and controls in these parameters. BMI percentile correlated with leptin levels in children with coeliac disease. Study 3 The objectives of this study were to determine anthropometric parameters and leptin levels in children with IBD and ascertain if BMI correlates with leptin levels in these children. Thirty children with IBD and 60 age and gender matched controls were enrolled. Anthropometric measurements and leptin levels were analysed and compared with controls. IBD children had significantly low weight for age (p=0.002), BMI percentiles (p=0.001) and leptin levels (p=0.009) compared to controls. There was a correlation between BMI and leptin levels in IBD children. In conclusion, this thesis has shown that one quarter of hospitalized children were overweight or obese, and further, that half of the hospitalised children were at high risk of nutritional deterioration and these children had longer hospital stay than children at no risk. Children with coeliac disease had similar anthropometric measurements, body compartments and leptin levels to controls. However, children with IBD had lower anthropometric measurements and leptin levels, indicating under-nutrition. Nutritional assessment should be a mandatory part of clinical management with nutritional status assessed by various tools including NRS, anthropometry, BIA and leptin levels.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nutritional assessment.</field><field name="subject">Nutritional risk scores.</field><field name="subject">Bioelectrical impedance analysis.</field><field name="subject">Serum leptin.</field><field name="subject">Anthropometry.</field><field name="subject">Coeliac disease.</field><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41109</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis, purification and micronisation of copper indomethacin using dense gas technology</field><field name="creator">Warwick, Barry, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this work was to provide an alternative method of synthesis of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug copper indomethacin (Cu-Indo) and to produce alternative forms of the drug to increase its marketability. Dense gases as anti-solvents were used to achieve these aims. The study involved the synthesis, purification, micronisation and co-precipitation of Cu-Indo with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Initially the volumetric and solubility behaviours of the solvent???anti-solvent systems were investigated to determine the optimum processing conditions. The solubility of Cu-Indo in an expanded solution was found to be a complex function of the solvent and other solutes. Copper indomethacin was successfully synthesised and purified in a single vessel using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. Drug yields of 98 % and purities near 100 % were achieved at optimum conditions with the advantages of less residual solvent in the drug, less solvent waste, reduced processing time and increased yields over the conventional synthesis process. Copper indomethacin was produced in a variety of morphologies and particle sizes using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. An investigation of the effect of process parameters on the particle characteristics showed that solute concentration was the dominant variable. Spherical particles with diameters less than 8 mm were obtained at optimum conditions. The immediate benefit of micronising Cu-Indo was demonstrated with an eight fold increase in dissolution rate when compared to the conventionally produced drug. Polyvinylpyrrolidone was successfully co-precipitated with Cu-Indo using dense carbon dioxide as an anti-solvent. The PVP???Cu-Indo co-precipitates were found to increase the solubility of the drug in ethanol with a 36 fold solubility enhancement at optimum conditions.  The use of dense carbon dioxide as anti-solvent in this work demonstrates the potential of the GAS and ASES processes in the pharmaceutical industry. Copper indomethacin was synthesised, purified and micronised in a single vessel at a substantial saving in terms of time and solvent usage. The micronisation of Cu-Indo and the formation of the PVP???Cu-Indo co-precipitate provided alternative forms of the drug substantially increasing its marketability.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Indomethacin</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17876</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of deregulation on financial market efficiency in Sri Lanka</field><field name="creator">Cooray, Arusha, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of  deregulation on financial market   efficiency in Sri Lanka.  The concept of efficiency used here is due to Fama (1970) who defines an efficient market  as one in which prices fully reflect all available information.  Given the significant expansion of Sri Lanka???s financial markets in the post deregulation period,   efficiency is investigated in the context of these  markets.  To this end,  the study employs a  number of standard tests for market efficiency including; the expectations hypothesis of the term structure, the Fisher hypothesis, uncovered interest parity, speculative efficiency,   real interest rate equalization and tests of capital mobility.  Although the overall results presented in this study  suggest  that Sri Lanka???s financial markets are not fully efficient, the evidence provides significant insight to the performance of these markets.  The main policy lesson to be learnt from this analysis  is that financial deregulation   will not automatically promote market efficiency unless accompanied by positive policy action to reinforce the impact of these reforms.  In conclusion  therefore, the study makes a number of recommendations which could help to reinforce the impact of financial deregulation on market efficiency.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Financial institutions</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="subject">Deregulation</field><field name="subject">Money market</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/17885</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between corporate governance and accounting conservatism</field><field name="creator">Roslinda, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Whilst extensive research has been done on the association between corporate governance and firm performance, the empirical evidence is inconclusive. This thesis argues that the failure of past studies to establish a positive association between corporate governance and performance might be caused by the use of conservative accounting in firms. If firms with stronger corporate governance adopt more conservative accounting procedures, then tests of the relationship between corporate governance characteristics and performance will be biased downwards. If market participants fail to recognise a link between conservative accounting and corporate governance, then firms with stronger corporate governance might also be systematically undervalued. Therefore, studying the relationship between selected corporate governance attributes and the extent of conservative accounting does more than just extend our understanding of the link between governance characteristics and accounting quality. It also provides useful insights for interpreting the existing literature on the association between corporate governance and performance.  In this thesis, detailed investigation is undertaken of the link between several governance characteristics (as well as an aggregate index) and the extent of conservatism evident in Australian firms?? financial reporting. Overall, the results provide only weak evidence that firms with certain governance characteristics report more conservatively. Evidence of any such link is restricted to measures of board composition and leadership, and even then the results are sensitive to the method used to measure the extent of conservatism in financial reporting. There is no systematic evidence of an association for measures of audit committee composition, nor board size. Finally, there is only weak evidence that use of a Big 5 auditor affects the extent of conservatism and the results are sensitive to the period investigated. These results are all robust to explicitly recognizing possible endogeneity between the extent of conservative accounting and the governance attributes examined.  Overall, the results raise important questions about the extent to which widely advocated corporate governance attributes result in accounting outcomes which accelerate the revelation of relatively poor economic news, at least for Australian firms in the years examined (1998 and 2002). However, beyond the immediate relationship examined, the results also suggest that caution is appropriate before dismissing the absence of a link between governance attributes and firm performance as being attributable to accounting conservatism.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Board of directors</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Conservatism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43611</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inhibitory control in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</field><field name="creator">Falconer, Erin Michelle, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder characterised by disturbed arousal, altered attention, and fear processing, and a reduction in the ability to perform cognitive tasks.  Predominant neurophysiological models of PTSD have been focused on alterations in fear-related regulation, and few incorporate broader changes in generic executive control which may underlie many of the clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits in PTSD. This thesis aimed to investigate the neurophysiology of executive inhibitory control in PTSD using a Go/NoGo response inhibition task and converging functional imaging, structural imaging and electrophysiological measures.  The first series of studies aimed to elucidate a normative neural network model of inhibitory control, and are consistent with normative control involving the activation of a mainly right-lateralised ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) network. Inhibitory control-related activation was found to be affected by levels of anxiety and changes in underlying neural structure; alterations in frontal cortical maturation and volume were related to additional activation of bilateral frontal cortical regions and the dorsal striatum, with anxiety increasing the demand on inhibitory control-related activation.  In contrast to healthy participants, PTSD was associated with reduced inhibitory control as indexed by inhibitory behaviour, diminished activation of the right VLPFC, and slowed inhibition-related information processsing.  PTSD participants relied on the greater activation of a left fronto-striatal inhibition network to support control, with the activation affected by levels of PTSD severity and comorbid anxiety.  This left fronto-striatal activation in PTSD was related to underlying increases in fronto-striatal neural structure.  Further, the ability to efficiently engage a left fronto-striatal network in PTSD during inhibitory control predicted better response to cognitive behavior for PTSD, consistent with the proposal that an improved ability to flexibly engage control systems may facilitate the resolution of PTSD symptoms.  Taken together, this program of research extends current neurophysiological model of PTSD to show that PTSD involves a fundamental disturbance in the function and structure of key fronto-striatal response control networks associated with inhibitory control.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fMRI</field><field name="subject">posttraumatic stress disorder</field><field name="subject">inhibition</field><field name="subject">ERP</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">executive control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework to enforce privacy in business processes</field><field name="creator">Li, Yin Hua, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Service-oriented architectures (SOA), and in particular Web services, have quickly become a popular paradigm to develop distributed applications.  Nowadays, more and more organizations shift their core business to the Web services platform within which various interactions between the autonomous services occur. One of the widely accepted standards in the Web services platform is Business Process Execution Lan- guage for Web Services (BPEL4WS, or BPEL for short). BPEL de&#64257;nes a language to integrate Web services by creating composite Web services in the form of business processes following the service orchestration paradigm, and it enables organizations to focus on core competence and mission-critical operations while outsource every- thing else to reduce costs and time to market.  However BPEL is de&#64257;cient in privacy issues.   The facts are:  (1) service requestors?? personal information is fundamental to enable business processes (e.g., the mortgage approval business process); (2) privacy concerns have become one of the most important issues in Information Technology and has received increasing at- tention from organizations, consumers and legislators; (3) most organizations have recognized that dealing correctly and honestly with customers?? privacy concerns can have bene&#64257;cial returns for their businesses, not only in terms of being compliant with laws and regulations but also in terms of reputation and potential business op- portunities. If not addressed properly, privacy concerns may become an impediment to the widespread adoption of BPEL.  Privacy issues have many aspects, the privacy concerns of potential service re- questor (i.e., client) and the privacy concerns of service provider (i.e., organization) are two of them.   Service requestor speci&#64257;es his/her privacy concerns as privacy preference, while service provider de&#64257;nes and publishes its privacy policy to specify its privacy promises. Before requestor accesses certain service, he/she likes to know whether the service provider will respect his/her privacy preference. Otherwise, the requestor may seek the desired service from somewhere else.  On the other hand,even though most organizations publish their privacy promises, it will be more convincing if customers are assured that such privacy promises are actually kept within the organizations.  In this thesis, we propose a privacy enforcement framework for business processes. In particular, we focus on those that are automated using BPEL. The framework consists of two parts. One focuses on the service requestors?? perspective of privacy, the other concentrates on the privacy concerns of the business process owner (i.e., the service provider). More speci&#64257;cally, the &#64257;rst part of the framework is based on description logic, and allows to represent privacy concepts and perform some rea- soning about these concepts.  The reasoning engine will check requestor??s privacy preference against the service provider??s published privacy promises before the re- questor accesses the desired service.  The second part of the framework facilitates the service provider to enforce its privacy policy within all its business processes throughout the life cycle of personal data. The privacy enforcement can be achieved step by step:  privacy inspection, privacy veri&#64257;cation and privacy obligation man- agement.  The &#64257;rst step, privacy inspection, aims to identify which activity needs the involvement of what personal data. The second step, privacy veri&#64257;cation, is to verify the correctness of designed BPEL business processes in terms of privacy. The third step is to enforce the privacy by managing the ful&#64257;llment of the obligation during the execution of business process.  The  privacy  enforcement  framework  presented  in  the  thesis  has  been  implemented.   The &#64257;rst part of the framework is implemented in the Privacy Match Engine prototype.  For the second part of the framework, as different parts of the privacy policy need to be enforced at different stages of the life cycle of business processes, the implementation consists of a privacy veri&#64257;cation tool and a privacy obligation management system.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">business process,</field><field name="subject">privacy protection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intrinsic magnetic aftereffect in Dy(Co,Ni)2 compounds</field><field name="creator">Carmichael, Christine Mary, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Measurements were made of the rate of magnetization, and the magnetization of the series of Dy (Co, Ni)2 compounds to investigate the intrinsic magnetic after effect. This effect is demonstrated by the existence of an intrinsic coercivity such that a critical value of applied field, Hc, must be reached before the domain walls can move freely through the material. However there is some movement of domain walls of fields below Hc, and this gives rise to time dependent magnetization. The mechanisms by which the domain walls overcome the energy barrier to their motion at fields below Hc was investigated in pulsed field, and in steady fields. After measuring the critical field and magnetic moments of each sample, the pulsed field magnetometer results were analysed to show that there is a certain temperature above which the mechanism for domain wall motion appears to be that described by Taylor???s thermal activation model. Below that particular temperature, the magnetization rate depends on the reciprocal of the applied field, and an empirical model is suggested. Estimates are made of the number of spines contained in the average wall kink; the wall jump frequency and the energy barrier. A vibrating sample magnetometer was used to study the magnetization of the specimens in steady fields. The results indicate that both the mechanisms described above are in operation, with thermal activation being a possibility at temperatures as low as 4.2K.</field><field name="date">1981</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Magnetism</field><field name="subject">Domain structure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18161</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of Irrigation and Fertilization on the Belowground Carbon Allocation in a Pine Plantation</field><field name="creator">Pongracic, Silvia, School of Biological Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aboveground and belowground productivity of forest systems are interlinked through complex feedback loops involving tree, soil and environmental factors.  With a predicted significant change in environmental conditions through the enhanced greenhouse effect, it is important to understand the response of forest systems to these new conditions.  An increase in atmospheric CO2 is predicted to increase photosynthesis, and therefore whole plant productivity at the individual tree level.   However this increase in photosynthesis may result in greater requirements for nutrients, particularly nitrogen (N).  In order to acquire any additional available N, trees may respond by increasing their proportional allocation of C belowground to the root system.  This study aimed to quantify the belowground C allocation in a mature forest system consisting of a single species on a single site, but with different levels of water and nutrient stress.  The belowground carbon dynamics of a range of irrigated and fertilized Pinus radiata stands in Australia were investigated during 1992 and 1993.   Belowground carbon allocation was estimated using the model proposed by Raich and Nadelhoffer (1989) where belowground C allocation is the difference between soil respiration and carbon input through litterfall, plus coarse root production and an adjustment for any change in soil and litter layer carbon pools.  This model is best described by the equation: Belowground C = Csoilresp ?? Clitterfall + Ccoarseroot+ ???Cforest floor+ ???Csoil    Soil respiration, measured using a modified soda lime absorption method either every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks for 2 years, showed a range in daily soil C flux from 137 ?? 785 mgCO2.m-2.h-1.  Soil respiration showed seasonal trends with summer highs and winter lows.   Limited fine root biomass data could not indicate a strong relationship between measured soil respiration and fine root (&amp;gt2mm diameter) biomass.   Fifty three percent of the variation in soil respiration measurements in irrigated treatments was explained by a linear relationship between soil respiration, and soil temperature at 0.10 m depth and litter moisture content.   In non-irrigated treatments, 61% of the variation in soil  xix respiration measurements was explained by a linear relationship between soil temperature at 1 cm depth and soil moisture content.  Inter-year variation was considerable with annual soil respiration approximately 20% lower in 1993 compared with 1992.  Annual soil C flux was calculated by linear interpolation and ranged from 3.4 ?? 11.2 tC ha-1 across the treatments.  Soil C pools remained unchanged over 10 years between 1983 and 1993 for all combinations of irrigated and fertilized stands, despite significant aboveground productivity differences over the decade.  Measurements of standing litter showed a change between 1991 and 1993 for only 2 out of the 10 treatments.  These two treatments had belowground C allocation estimated both with and without an adjustment for a change in standing litter.  Annual litterfall C ranged almost four fold from 0.6 ?? 2.2 tC ha-1 between the treatments in 1992 and 1993, and fell within the ranges of measured litterfall over 10 years at the field site.  Again inter-year variation was large, with the 1993 litterfall values being approximately 97% greater across all treatments compared with 1992 values.    Belowground carbon allocation was calculated using C fluxes measured at the field site, and ranged 3 fold from 4.4 ?????? 12.9 tC ha-1 between the treatments during 1992 and 1993.  In 1993 the belowground C allocation was approximately 30% lower across all treatments compared with 1992 calculations.  This was due to an approximate 23% reduction in annual soil C flux, a 97% increase in litterfall C and an 18% reduction in coarse root production between 1992 and 1993.  The field site was N limited, and differences in belowground C allocation could be shown across irrigated treatments with different N limitations.  As N availability increased belowground C allocation was decreased in the irrigated treatments.  It was difficult to determine differences in belowground C allocation caused by water stress as the effects of water and N limitation were confounded.  An increase in N availability generally indicated an increase in coarse root and litterfall C production, which were reflected in increased aboveground productivity.  In high N treatments the coarse root fraction of belowground C allocation comprised approximately 50% of the total belowground C allocation, whereas in the N stressed treatments coarse roots only comprised 20% of the total belowground allocation  The mechanistic model BIOMASS was used to estimate annual gross primary productivity (GPP) for the different treatments at the field site.  BIOMASS estimated GPPs of between 30-38 tC ha-1 for the different treatments during 1992 and 1993.  The measured belowground carbon allocation ranged from 16 ?? 40 % of simulated GPP, with the lower proportion allocated belowground in the irrigated and high fertility stands.  Aboveground competition through the absence of thinning also appeared to reduce allocation belowground in non- irrigated stands.    A direct trade off between bole and belowground C could not be demonstrated, unless data were separated by year and by the presence or absence of irrigation.  Where data were separated in this manner, only three data points defined the reasonably strong, negative relationship between bole and belowground C.  The value of this relationship is highly questionable and should be interpreted with caution.  Thus a decrease in belowground C allocation may not necessarily indicate a concomitant increase in bole C allocation.    Inter-year variation in a number of C pools and fluxes measured at the field site was at least as great as the variation between stands having different water and N limitation.  Extrapolation of belowground productivity estimates from a single years data should be undertaken cautiously.    The work undertaken in this study indicated that for a given forest stand in a given soil type, an increase in N availability reduced the absolute and relative C allocated belowground.   However this decrease in C belowground may not directly translate as an increase in stem growth or increased timber production.    Forest productivity in an enhanced greenhouse environment is likely to result in an increased allocation of C belowground due to increased N limitation, unless adequate N is present to support a more active canopy.  Further work is required to more fully understand the dynamics of the belowground system in a changing environment.  However further research should focus on mature forest systems in order to isolate the impacts of natural ageing changes from perturbation effects on the forest system.  This would be best undertaken in long term monitoring sites where a C history of the stand may be available.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pinus radiata Soils</field><field name="subject">Atmospheric carbon dioxide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18164</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel biological functions of apolipoprotein-E</field><field name="creator">Elliott, David Anthony, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">ApoE is a polymorphic protein that has been found to play many different roles in biological processes including lipid transport, neurobiology and immunoregulation. ApoE occurs in the human population in three major isoforms; apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4. The apoE4 isoform has been identified as a major risk factor for several diseases including atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, therefore a greater understanding of apoE biology is highly sought after. In my thesis, I have investigated several novel aspects of apoE biology. I have identified an association between increased apoE expression and apoptosis in a neuronal cell type and demonstrated that apoE becomes enriched within the neuronal apoptotic debris, consistent with a possible role for apoE in facilitating apoptotic debris clearance. A possible anti-apoptotic role of apoE in macrophages was assessed by reducing or eliminating apoE expression using siRNA and cells isolated from apoE knockout animals, respectively. The removal of apoE did not alter overall sensitivity to apoptosis, however, it did significantly increase staurosporine-induced caspase-3 activation. In other studies, the poorly understood accumulation of apoE within the nucleus was found to be enhanced during serum starvation and to localise in intra-nuclear structures that are distinct from inter-chromatin granule clusters. Analysis of apoE within the human brain revealed a correlation between fragmentation and the apoE3 isoform which was independent from AD status and brain region examined. Additionally, a portion of brain apoE3 was found to be present in the form of disulphide-linked dimers. Collectively, these studies have further expanded the current knowledge of apoE biology in terms of its association with apoptosis, nuclear localization and structural differences between the apoE3 and apoE4 isoforms in the human brain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Apolipoprotein-E.</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43926</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modalities, conditionals and nonmonotonic reasoning</field><field name="creator">Jauregui, Victor, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation conducts an investigation into nonmonotonic reasoning---forms of reasoning which allow defeasible inferences arrived at in the absence of  complete information, and which, when additional information is acquired, may need to be revoked. In contrast to the mathematical notion of consequence which is based on proof---mathematical proofs, once established, are beyond reproach, no matter what  additional information is acquired---nonmonotonic forms of reasoning are often employed in Artificial Intelligence, where generally only incomplete information is available, and often 'working' inferences need to be made; e.g. default inferences.  The platform on which this analysis of nonmonotonic reasoning is carried out is conditional logic; a relative of modal logic. This thesis explores notions of consequence formulated in conditional logic, and explores its possible-worlds semantics, and its connection to nonmonotonic consequence relations.  In particular, the notion of default consequence is explored, receiving the interpretation that something is inferred to be true by default if it holds in a `majority' of possible worlds. A number of accounts of majority-based reasoning appear in the literature. However, it is argued that some of the more well known accounts have counter-intuitive properties. An alternative definition of `majorities' is furnished, and both modal and conditional formulations of this form of inference are given and compared---favourably---with similar approaches in the literature.  A second, traditional problem of reasoning in Artificial Intelligence is tackled in  this thesis: reasoning about action. The treatment presented is again based on conditional logic, but also incorporates an account of dynamic logic. The semantics proposed approaches the frame problem from a different perspective; the familiar `minimal change' approach is generalised to an account based on the principle known as Occam's Razor.  The conditional introduced proves to be a valuable contribution to the account given---which again is compared, and contrasted with other approaches in the literature---accommodating a causal approach to the problem of correctly determining the indirect effects of an action.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Artificial Intelligence</field><field name="subject">Logic</field><field name="subject">Nonmonotonic reasoning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43641</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silicon quantum dot superlattices in dielectric matrices: SiO2, Si3N4 and SiC</field><field name="creator">Cho, Young Hyun, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Silicon quantum dots (QDs) in SiO2 superlattices were fabricated by alternate deposition of silicon oxide (SiO2) and silicon-rich oxide (SRO), i.e. SiOx (x&lt;2), and followed by high temperature annealing. A deposited SRO film is thermodynamically unstable below 1173oC and phase separation and diffusion of Si atoms in the amorphous SiO2 matrix creates nano-scaled Si quantum dots. The quantum-confined energy gap was measured by static photoluminescence (PL) using an Argon ion laser operating at 514.5 nm. The measured energy band gaps of crystalline Si QDs in SiO2 matrix at room temperature (300 K) show that the emission energies from 1.32 eV to 1.65 eV originating Si dot sizes from 6.0 nm to 3.4 nm, respectively. There is a strong blue-shift of the PL energy peak position with decreasing the quantum dot size and this shows the evidence of quantum confinement of our fabricated Si QDs in SiO2 matrix. The PL results indicate that the fabricated Si QDs in SiO2 matrix could be suitable for the device application such as top cell material for all-silicon tandem solar cells. Silicon QD superlattices in nitride matrix were fabricated by alternate deposition of silicon nitride (Si3N4) and silicon-rich nitride (SRN) by PECVD or co-sputtering of Si and Si3N4 targets. High temperature furnace annealing under a nitrogen atmosphere was required to form nano-scaled silicon quantum dots in the nitride matrix. The band gap of silicon QD superlattice in nitride matrix (3.6- 7.0 nm sized dots) is observed in the energy range of 1.35- 1.98 eV. It is about 0.3- 0.4 eV blue-shifted from the band gap of the same sized quantum dots in silicon oxide. It is believed that the increased band gap is caused by a silicon nitride passivation effect.  Silicon-rich carbide (SRC, i.e. Si1-xCx) thin films with varying atomic ratio of the Si to C were fabricated by using magnetron co-sputtering from a combined Si and C or SiC targets. Off-stoichiometric Si1-xCx is of interest as a precursor to realize Si QDs in SiC matrix, because it is thermodynamically metastable when the composition fraction is in the range 0 &lt; x &lt; 0.5. Si nanocrystals are therefore able to precipitate during a post-annealing process. SiC quantum dot superlattices in SiC matrix were fabricated by alternate deposition of thin layers of carbon-rich silicon carbide (CRC) and SRC using a layer by layer deposition technique. CRC layers were deposited by reactive co-sputtering of Si and SiC targets with CH4. The PL energy band gap (2.0 eV at 620 nm) from 5.0 nm SRC layers could be from the nanocrystalline ??-SiC with Si-O bonds and the PL energy band gap (1.86 eV at 665 nm) from 6.0 nm SRC layers could be from the nanocrystalline ??-SiC with amorphous SiC clusters, respectively. The dielectric material for an all-silicon tandem cell is preferably silicon oxide, silicon nitride or silicon carbide.

The percursor alloys and catalysts were characterised using Optical Microscopy, X-ray Diffractometer, Scanning Electron Microscopy, Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and BET surface area in term of morphologies, phase identification, surface area and pore structure.  Skeletal copper catalyst presented high surface areas and consisted primarily of CuAl2 grains, with small well-dispersed areas of the Al-CuAl2 eutectic. The CuAl2 phase, which represented a tetragonal structure, showed large cell volumes resulted in a fine skeleton structure. Binary nickel-copper catalyst composed of three majority phases including Ni2Al3, Cu4NiAl7 and Al. The Cu4NiAl7 was found to be a caustic resistant phase which led to low surface area in the nickel-copper catalyst In terms of the selective removal of aluminium from the copper-cobalt-aluminium alloy to create the binary copper-cobalt catalyst, 11 alloy samples with various compositions were produced following the ternary phase diagram. The surface area and pore size of these catalysts was dependant on the crystal structure of the phases present and the amount of remaining Al. Electrochemical glucose oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction activity have been used for testing the catalyst performance.  The electrochemical oxidation of glucose experiment using 11 samples of skeletal Cu-Co catalyst as an electrode showed the results that the significant oxidation peaks were observed in sample 1, 4, 8, 9 and the small oxidation humps were observed in other sample except sample 2. These small peaks resulted from that the glucose molecule had difficulty to absorb on the surface area of the skeletal Cu-Co catalysts electrode. The difficulty may results from very fine pore volume and pore size of the catalysts. In term of assessing the skeletal Cu-Co catalyst with electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide experiment, the skeletal Cu-Co catalyst sample 7 which presented the highest surface area was selected as an electrode to compare with Cu foil electrode. The result of using skeletal Cu-Co as an electrode indicated significantly higher current. This results from that a skeletal Cu-Co catalyst electrode presented an actual high surface area which leads to more adsorbed regions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of trade liberalisation on growth, poverty and income distribution: a dynamic computable general equilibrium analysis with an application to Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Wong, Melissa Oi Ming, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent decades, there have been an increasingly large number of developing countries that have embraced external economic liberalisation policies. Following trade theory, trade liberalisation has the potential to increase employment elasticity of economic growth and hence, have a greater poverty reduction impact, compared to import-substitution or closed economies. However, critics of globalisation often emphasise that the benefits from growth may not be evenly spread; hence, the distributional impacts may have an adverse effect on the poor. Vietnam has undertaken major market-based reforms to transform itself into an outward-oriented economy. The resulting effects show that not only has Vietnam achieved significant growth, but it has also managed to satisfy all the Millennium Development Goals. However, a significant element of Vietnam&#146;s reforms involves integrating the Vietnamese economy with world markets through trade liberalisation policies, which may affect the welfare and distributional impacts on Vietnamese households. This dissertation examines the impact of trade liberalisation on growth, poverty and inequality for Vietnam. It develops a macro-micro analytical framework whereby a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is linked to a representative household model in order to capture these effects. The findings indicate that trade liberalisation will cause a significant increase in economic growth. The smallest gains occur under Vietnam&#146;s unilateral trade liberalisation against ASEAN while the largest gains take place when Vietnam extends its liberalisation with the rest of the world. There will be a shift away from primary sectors towards industry-based sectors such as low-tech, intermediate manufacturing and durables. There is also substantial up-skilling of unskilled labour. Combined with the large real returns to capital goods, this will result in significant increases in both capital investments as well as in the accumulation of human capital. In addition, economic growth will induce a fall in poverty rates in Vietnam. Nonetheless, there will also be large increases in the inequality of income, especially in the rural sector. Hence, although growth has lifted a large proportion of households out of poverty, the distributional impacts have been detrimental to the most vulnerable households.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">Trade liberalisation</field><field name="subject">Vietnam</field><field name="subject">Income inequality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43290</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Into the Third Millennium: Neocorporatism, the State and the Urban Planning Profession</field><field name="creator">Marshall, Nancy, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis maintains that, far from being politically impartial bodies, as professional associations might suggest, professions as a whole are resolutely influenced in their activities by the political will of the times.  At the beginning of the third millennium, this ???will??? is described as neocorporatism, an ideology based on corporate structure and third sector co-governance.  The research highlights the interrelationships between professions and ideology.  A case study of the Canadian Institute of Planners - CIP - demonstrates how this neocorporatist philosophy is having an impact on its power and legitimacy and, ultimately, its effect within Canadian society.  An historical review demonstrates how the Canadian Institute of Planners has reacted to and reflected state ideology throughout its history.  It is clear that the organisation has been in a submissive relationship with the state until recently, where we see the balance of power starting to shift.  The CIP is currently reorganising itself to better integrate with the state and improve its government relations.  Documentation tracks the CIP???s participation in national policy processes and shows that it is, in fact, becoming significantly more involved in policy-making through various federal government consultation and partnership initiatives.  The Canadian Institute of Planners seems to rely solely on practical conjecture to inform its operational choices.  My hermeneutical discourse analysis uses existing theory and empirical information to advance our understanding of the CIP and by implication, professions in general.  This enlightenment can help direct the organisation???s strategy within the neocorporate state apparatus and, ultimately, enable it to gain power, legitimacy and greater influence within Canada???s policy- and decision-making spheres.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">urban planning</field><field name="subject">professions</field><field name="subject">Canadian Institute of Planners</field><field name="subject">ideology</field><field name="subject">neocorporatism</field><field name="subject">urban policy</field><field name="subject">city planning</field><field name="subject">city planners</field><field name="subject">political aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Currents, coasts and cays : a study of tidal upwelling and island wakes</field><field name="creator">Coutis, Peter F., School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the phenomenon of flow-topography interaction is considered in the context of two dynamically distinct case studies. In the first study, tidally-driven upwelling is investigated usingfield data collected in Hydrographers Passage (20????S), a narrow, navigable channel in the dense outer reef matrix of the southern Great Barrier Reef, Australia. In the second study, island wake formations at Cato Island (155????32????E, 23????15????S) in the deep, Western Coral Sea are examined using a combination of field data and numerical experiments. The result of the Hydrographers Passage study are of considerable scientific interest since they apply to numerous smaller non-navigable reef-edge passages dotted throughout the southern Great Barrier Reef. Strong, semi-diurnal flood tides flowing through a gap in a distal patch reef system at the shelf break generate strong upwelling, providing a pulsed, semi-diurnal input of nutrients to the reefs offshore of the passage. If stable in the long term, this mechanism could have profound evolutionary implications for large reefal areas in the southern Great Barrier Reef.  In the second study, two sets of field observations at Cato Island coincided with conditions of strong (~0.7m s-1), vertically sheared incident currents and weaker (~0.3m s-1), more variable incident flows. The combination of dynamically distinct flow regimes and a tall, steep-sided island penetrating oligotrophic surface waters provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of island wakes on hydrographic structure and biological enhancement. Field data indicate that flow disturbances downstream of Cato Island are likely to generate biological enhancement during conditions of eddy shedding and non-shedding wakes.  A primitive equation numerical model configured on the basis of field observations faithfully reproduces the key features of both data sets; mechanisms responsible for producing these key features are proposed. Previous numerical studies of island wakes have concentrated primarily on eddy shedding flows. In this thesis, the sub-critical (non-shedding) flow scenario is also considered. It is demonstrated that particle retention in island wakes has a ????hair trigger???? characteristic controlled by incident flow speed. This observation leads to a new proposal to explain the long-standing recruitment problem of biological oceanography.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wakes</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Ocean currents</field><field name="subject">Upwelling</field><field name="subject">Oceanography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Concrete Holographic Image: an Examination of Spatial and Temporal Properties and their Application in a Religious Art Work</field><field name="creator">Dawson, Paula Heatley, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The premise of this thesis is that the ???concrete holographic image???, a laser transmission hologram which has an object or a hologram of an object as its subject, has unique spatial and temporal properties which can suggest a plurality of tenses to a viewer. There is a lack of comprehensive analysis of the holographic representational system within art related theoretical and critical writing and a tendency to analyse individual works only in terms of generalities which apply to the concepts surrounding the holographic medium. While these form an important background for art image production, in some cases corresponding to artists works, the existing written material on the subject is inadequate as a model from which to draw the all important temporal conclusions.  To date the critical reception of holograms has made no mention of acuity, the size of the viewing frustum, the depth of the image and scant mention of interference phenomena which are the intrinsic factors which I believe precipitate temporal illusions. Therefore this thesis examines the concrete holographic image in great detail on its own terms, firstly through theories of the basic image forming phenomena of interference and diffraction and secondly through the techniques of production as they have been adapted for the making of my art works. The extent of the metaphorical and allegorical potential of the spatial and temporal properties of the concrete holographic image are put to the ultimate test in a commission for St Brigid???s Church, Coogee. The Shrine of the Sacred Heart commission for St Brigid???s requires a concrete holographic image to facilitate devotion to the Sacred Heart.

Six candidate components thought to be involved in implicit learning were identified: task demands, affordances of experimental materials, subjects????? intentions, content of knowledge, form of representation and awareness. A series of 15 experiments are reported that investigated the learning in the invariant digit, invariant clocks, and the artificial grammar task in an attempt to determine the role of these six components. The empirical findings were interpreted as supporting the view that learning under implicit task conditions: i) is interactive and not passive, ii) does not result in the acquisition of a default representation of knowledge, but that any structure remains latent within an experience until appropriate retrieval cues are provided at test, and iii) does not proceed ?????outside????? awareness but that the lack of insight that often accompanies learning is due to poor understanding about the basis of performance. A framework was proposed that demonstrated how this pattern of objective performance and subjective experience arises, through the interaction of the candidate components. This framework is more consistent with a process-oriented view (e.g. Whittlesea &amp; Wright, 1997) than a separate systems account of implicit learning (e.g. Reber, 1989).</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Implicit learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18220</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terror Australis: being a fictionalised extract from the journal of Matthew Flinders, concerning a series of conversations regarding masculine identity as located in contemporary Australia</field><field name="creator">Sheppard-Simms, Shannon Field, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract not included.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42194</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Exploring deeper structures in manufacturing strategy formation processes: a qualitative inquiry</field><field name="creator">Kiridena, Senevi Bandara, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports on an empirical investigation into manufacturing strategy (MS) formation in practice. The broad objective is to advance the understanding of MS processes through constructing consistent patterns in decision-making and action-taking relating to the manufacturing structure and infrastructure of the organisations studied.  Using a combined "Grounded Theory - Case Study" approach, nine organisations within the metal products, machinery and equipment manufacturing sectors in Australia were studied, in order to address the following research questions:  How are competitive priorities arrived at and translated into decisions and actions regarding the manufacturing structure and infrastructure? What are the consistent patterns of manufacturing strategy formation within specific organisational contexts and why those patterns exist that way?   Qualitative data gathered through interviews conducted with the management staff - based on the sequences of events, actions and decisions, as well as other broader aspects of MS - were analysed by means of progressive coding. The themes, relationships and conceptual schemas emerged through the coding process are presented using narratives and graphical displays. The overall findings are presented in aggregate terms using a conceptual model, supplemented by several theoretical propositions. Deeper structures in MS processes represent linear and parallel, converging and diverging and sequential and iterative progression of strategic initiatives across four major phases identified as initiation, progression, commitment and realisation. The multiple modes of initiation, alternative paths of consolidation and differing forms of commitment and realisation are explained by the nature of strategic initiatives, the causal links between the modes themselves and the influence of certain organisational contextual factors.  When enfolded in extant literature, these findings make two major contributions. First, apart from corroborating the complex and dynamic nature of MS formation in practice, they explicate the underlying patterns and alternative forms of MS formation. Second, they demonstrate some causal relationships between alternative forms of MS formation and certain contextual factors. These insights would inform future research, leading towards the development of a plausible mid-range theory of MS processes. They would also help practitioners to better understand the dynamics of MS formation and to nurture appropriate forms of MS formation within specific organisational settings.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Qualitative research</field><field name="subject">Operations management and strategy</field><field name="subject">Strategy process</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cover me: animal defences, armour and the amulet</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Kamila, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cover Me: Animal Defences, Armour and the Amulet is a research project undertaken through studio investigations in the field of contemporary jewellery and object design. This interrogation is presented as a body of wearable and non-wearable objects exhibited at Kudos Gallery, Sydney Australia, in May 2009 and contextualised through a written document.  Historically jewellery's functions have been to denote rank, to adorn and to protect the wearer by magical means. The research investigates traditional approaches to magical jewellery- surveying the design of charms, amulets and talismans and the perceived methods of their functioning- and observes their parallels and similarities with defensive structures and behaviours such as the phenomenon of mimicry in the animal kingdom.  The document presents a survey of the work of contemporary jewellery artists whose visual language is informed by natural forms and bears a remarkable numinous presence, employing this analysis to comment on humanity's relationship with and separation from nature. The works in Cover Me are developed from and framed by similar speculations and the findings anchored to the body.  Through primary studio research that involves staged visual investigations of a variety of animal defences a series of drawn and material experiments have been undertaken. The findings generated in the studio have utilised the amplification and exaggeration of recurring elements. The repetitive attributes are employed to harness our instinctive reactions to animal defences and serve as the foundation for the design of a widely accessible visual vocabulary of protection. The resultant summary is articulated in metal and fibre and manifest in the series of jewellery objects.  In offering itself up as an example of work where protective language symbolism can be understood as such by people from a variety of cultural and religious backgrounds and as an alternative for traditional protective symbols. Cover Me attempts to mitigate the damage inflicted upon the magical jewel's perceived metaphysical protection by misappropriation where traditional amuletic devices and protective religious symbols (the Christian cross/ crucifix being a key example) are misappropriated in commercial fashion jewellery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43667</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The management of change in six Victorian secondary colleges</field><field name="creator">Daniels, Ray, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explored change in six Victorian secondary colleges some four years into the major school-system change program known as ?????Schools of the Future?????.   The purpose of the study was to identify successful models and practices for positive school change by exploring school change from the school level perspective.    A focus of the investigation was an organizational development program designed by a North American professor of organization and management in which Victorian school principals were trained as their schools entered the ?????Schools of the Future????? program. The project was guided initially by four major research questions to which six additional research questions were added as the research progressed.	The research methodology was qualitative.  The data for this investigation were collected in 1997.  The main means of gathering them was the in-depth interview of the principals of the six schools in the study and of the four members of staff they nominated as knowledgeable about their school?????s change processes.  A follow-up questionnaire to the interview, a telephone questionnaire that asked principals for background information about their schools, and a study of school documents were also sources of data.	The analysis and interpretation of the data related to charge in the schools was presented in the forms of six case studies and a multisite study.  	Eleven variables and eighteen insights identified the aspects associated with successful change across the sites.  The study?????s three major findings identified the critical importance in the success of change of the school?????s organizational culture and individual participants in change processes, its relationship to elements in its external environment and the nature of its planning for change. A theoretical framework for positive school change environments was developed.   It combined the elements associated with successful change in the study.

The investigation directs a proposed layout for the design of a device, which specifically addresses the incorporation of the concentrator theory into the design of a photovoltaic ????????roof tile????????. The focus of the investigation has been the integration of theoretical constructs and physical realities. The objective is to facilitate this transition from theory to reality: to contribute to the quest of creating viable manufacturable designs for the generation of clean low cost electrical power. The use of a roof tile as the focus of the incorporating device served two purposes. Number one: it provided a sensible, existing platform, which is under utilised, presented potential and fitted within established building practices. It was not the objective of this thesis to argue that tile integration is the best, only or even the most financially viable direction to pursue; it was one option among many. This brings us to the second purpose; the consideration of existing roofing tiles forced the theory to be applied within set limitations, in particular existing size restrictions. The imposition of a framework to work within highlighted the design issues, which would have to be addressed in the actualisation of the theory. The theory????????s broad strategy for economic viability has been to reduce the actual silicone cell content of panel designs by approximately one third. This is achieved by the use of numerically fewer cells in combination with a concentration method, which does not cost more than the savings gained by the use of fewer cells.

The first part considers numerical methods for dynamic portfolio optimisation in the expected utility model. The aim is to compare the risk-neutral computational approach (RNCA) also known as the martingale approach to stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) in a discrete-time setting. The main idea of the RNCA is to use the completeness and the arbitrage free properties of the market to compute the optimal consumption rules and then determine the trading strategy that finance this optimal consumption. In contrast, SDP solves for the optimal consumption and investment rules simultaneously using backward recursion and the principle of optimality. The setting that we consider is a discrete time and state space lattice. We provide some new theoretical results relating to the Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion class of utility functions as well as propose a straightforward implementation of RNCA in binomial and trinomial lattices. Moreover, instead of discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation with possibly more than one state variable, we use symbolic algorithms to implement stochastic dynamic programming. This new approach provides a simpler numerical procedure for computing optimal consumption-investment policies. A comparison of the RNCA with SDP demonstrates the superiority of the RNCA in terms of computation. 	The second part considers the pricing of contingent claims using an approach developed and applied in applied in insurance. This approach utilize probability distortion functions as the dual of the utility functions used in financial theory. The main idea of the dual theory is to distort the subjective probabilities rather than outcomes to express the investor????????s risk aversion. In the first part, the RNCA for asset allocation uses the same principle as risk-neutral valuation for derivative pricing. The idea of the second part of this research is to show that the risk-neutral valuation can be recovered from the probability distortion function approach, thereby establishing consistency between the insurance and the financial approaches. We prove that pricing contingent claims under the real world probability measure using an appropriate distortion operator produces arbitrage-free prices when the underlying asset prices are log-normal. We investigate cases when the insurance-based approach fails to produce arbitrage-free prices and determine the appropriate distortion operator under more general assumptions than those used in Black-Scholes option pricing. 	In the third part we introduce dynamic portfolio optimisation with risk measures based on probability distortion function and provide a formal treatment of this class of risk measures. We employ the RNCA to study the consumption-investment problem in discrete time with preferences consistent with Yaari????????s dual (non-expected utility) theory of choice. As an application, we first consider risk measures based on the Proportional Hazard Transform that treats the upside and downside of the risk differently and secondly a risk measure based on the standard Normal cumulative distribution function. When the objective is to maximise a dual utility of wealth, and the underlying security returns are normal, the efficient frontier is found to be the same as in the mean-variance portfolio problem for an equivalent risk tolerance. When the objective is to maximise a dual utility of consumption, then ????????plunging???????????? behaviour occurs ( investing everything is the risky asset). Other properties of the optimal consumption-investment policies in the dual theory are also investigated and discussed.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Portfolio management</field><field name="subject">Capital assets pricing model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18232</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Omega-3 fatty acids and depression in the perinatal period</field><field name="creator">Rees, Anne-Marie, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Omega-3 fatty acids are increasingly recognised as playing an important role in human brain development and mental health. The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) include omega-3 and omega-6 fats which are essential fatty acids (EFAs), consumed via the diet. Omega-3 fatty acids are particularly abundant in fish oils.  The omega-3 fatty acids are being focused on for their role in depression, the main types being docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which is abundant in neural tissue, and also eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which is biologically very active.  There is an emerging literature in relation to omega-3 fatty acid blood levels in depression and the effects of treatment with omega-3. Strong epidemiological evidence has also been published indicating an association between a population's fish intake and depression rates. A specific research focus on omega-3 as a treatment for depression in the perinatal period is also starting to emerge. The importance of this particular area is enhanced by the knowledge that omega-3 depletion occurs during the perinatal period due to fetal diversion for neurodevelopment.  In view of the lay public promotion of omega-3 and its appeal to women as a 'natural therapy', there is a need to scientifically evaluate its effectiveness to treat depression in the perinatal period. It is also important to investigate omega-3 as an alternative to antidepressants given the ongoing uncertainties regarding their safety in pregnancy.  In this thesis a literature review presents current research relating to this field. This is followed by a description of the methodology and results for the two trials conducted. The results of the double-blind randomised placebo controlled trial of omega-3 as a treatment for depression in the perinatal period were essentially negative. However this result is limited by the small sample size in the study and therefore it may be unwise to interpret the result as conclusive. The case-control study confirmed the hypothesis that omega-3 levels were more depleted in depressed women compared to non-depressed women. A discussion of the results and trial limitations then follows in the thesis. It is concluded that further larger studies are warranted in this area.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polyunsaturated fatty acids</field><field name="subject">Omega-3 fatty acids</field><field name="subject">Postnatal depression</field><field name="subject">Depression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43610</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Upgrading and commissioning of a high vacuum deposition system for the evaporation of silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="creator">Wolf, Michael, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using electron beam evaporation for the production of polycrystalline silicon (pc-Si) thin-film solar cells is an attractive alternative to PECVD deposition. Due to its faster deposition rate, using evaporation technology could significantly reduce module production costs. Other advantages are lower running costs, and the fact that no toxic gases are involved. However, currently no on-shelf equipment is available, and research in this field often relies on in-house designed systems. These can have various problems with reliability, deposition uniformity, and due to their custom design require frequent maintenance.  In this work, a newly purchased electron beam evaporation system was upgraded and redesigned to be capable of depositing amorphous Si diodes for the fabrication of pc-Si thin-film solar cells. The main goal of the upgrade was to provide a safe and reliable tool which allows for the deposition of high purity semiconductor material. Reliable and safe operation was accomplished by designing the entire electrical supply circuit and incorporating various safety interlocks. Source cross-contamination issues were addressed by installing a specially designed shroud (source housing). To provide uniform substrate temperatures up to 600??C, a heater was specially designed, fabricated, installed and tested. Accurate design of all mechanical system components was realised by using 3D product design software (ProEngineer).  The new evaporator was commissioned, which included testing and calibration of all the system components required for depositing on substrate sizes of up to 10x10cm2. Over this area a Si film thickness uniformity of +/-2%, performed with a maximum deposition rate of 7nm/s was achieved. Initial experiments using solid phase crystallisation and rapid thermal annealing revealed a sheet resistance uniformity of +/-4% for the Phosphorus and +/-7% for the Boron dopant effusion cell. Experimentation via Raman spectrometry and X-ray diffraction has revealed good crystalline properties, of the crystallised Si films, which is comparable to those of existing evaporation systems. Although the system was upgraded to achieve deposition pressures below 3x10-7 mbar, experiments have shown that this quality of vacuum may not be necessary for the fabrication of low impurity films. The system is now ready for further research in the field of thin-film photovoltaics, and the first functioning devices have been fabricated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evaporation.</field><field name="subject">Silicon.</field><field name="subject">Electron beam.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development and evaluation of a school-based prevention program for alcohol and cannabis use delivered via the internet</field><field name="creator">Newton, Nicola Clare Alice, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Alcohol and cannabis are the two most commonly used licit and illicit drugs in most developing countries including Australia. The burden of disease, social costs and harms associated with the use of these drugs is considerable. As such, the need for prevention is clear. Although an array of school-based drug prevention programs exist, the majority of these show minimal effects in reducing actual drug use. The most common impediments to their success concern obstacles to implementation and dissemination of programs, and a lack of sequential and developmentally appropriate messages.  The aim of this thesis was to address these limitations by developing and evaluating an integrated school-based prevention program to reduce alcohol and cannabis use. The innovative program known as the Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis Course is founded on current evidence-based research, adopts a harm-minimisation approach to drug prevention and is embedded within the school health curriculum. The core content of the program is delivered over the internet using novel cartoon storylines to engage students.  The early development of the course consisted of a cross-validation trial to test the feasibility and generalisability of an existing Climate Schools program for alcohol prevention. Extensive collaboration with teachers, students and health professionals was later conducted to extend and modify the Climate Schools framework to include the prevention of cannabis use. To date, this is the first time an internet-based harm-minimisation cannabis prevention program has been developed for use in schools.  To establish the efficacy of the comprehensive Climate Schools: Alcohol and Cannabis Course, a cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted with 10 schools in Sydney (n = 764). Results from this trial demonstrated the innovative course to be effective in increasing knowledge regarding alcohol and cannabis use, and in decreasing the use of these drugs six months following the intervention. This novel approach was found to be acceptable to students and teachers as a means of delivering drug education in schools. This thesis provides support for the more widespread dissemination of the Climate Schools model in schools. The barriers to dissemination require further research and are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Prevention</field><field name="subject">Cannabis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43681</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust, commitment, satisfaction and learning in construction project teams</field><field name="creator">Ong, Eric Mei-Siang, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aim of this research is to investigate how elements of the dynamic and temporary team environment of construction project teams influence trust, commitment, satisfaction and learning in the teams. While much can be learnt from the current literature about teams, the theories have mainly derived and focused on teams from permanent environments such as manufacturing, hospitality, health care, education and technology sectors. The uniqueness of construction project teams (for example, temporariness and multi-organisations involvement) creates a team working environment different from common permanent work teams. As such, numerous questions arise when we consider how construction project teams function and how the members are influenced by the temporary and dynamic team environment. For example, how do the project team members establish trust and commitment in the project team environment? How does the interdependency on each other to accomplish their assigned tasks influence individual members?? attitudes and learning in the project teams? The research adopted a cross-sectional mixed method research design employing both quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection in Singapore construction industry. The quantitative method involved survey questionnaires collected from 136 construction practitioners from 47 project teams. The qualitative method involved in-depth interviews with 28 construction practitioners. Quantitative statistical analysis was performed on the survey data using Statistical Package for Social Scientists (SPSS) and qualitative thematic analysis was performed on the interview data using computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software - NVivo.  Amongst other things the research findings indicated that individual team members?? perceived task interdependence and reward interdependence are positively related to their trust and commitment in the team. Additionally, their satisfaction in the team played a mediating role between the relationships. With respect to team learning, the research found that team goals, task interdependence and reward interdependence influence team learning, and team learning contributes to the performance of project teams. On a broad view, the circumstances in which how team members?? trust, commitment, satisfaction and team learning are influenced appear to be similar with other work teams. However, in-depth interviews with construction professionals revealed many complex and subtle factors relating specifically to construction project teams, such as, multi-projects and multi-organisations involvement, and degree of familiarity between the members before the team is set up. These factors are central to the team members. In conclusion, this study has brought insights into how temporary construction project team environment influence members?? team attitudes and team learning experience.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Trust</field><field name="subject">Commitment</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Construction Project Teams</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">"Low life" small objects to sit upon: a studio investigation into a rational use of materials for small scale domestic objects</field><field name="creator">Timar , Szuszy, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The project undertaken was aimed at extending a current craft based jewellery practice. Related by structure and materiality, the research sought to develop exploratory shapes as low seating objects to exist within small scale living spaces and studio apartments. Signaling an increased conscious way of thinking and working, a reflective process examining each form as series, provided an incremental creative strategy. The availability of discarded materials suggested possibilities for a sustainable cost effective option as a mode of contemporary practice. This combined approach was considered impact negative, diffusing global waste, and impact positive providing valid alternatives through functional and aesthetic objects.  At present waste materials exist as products are still designed and made on the basis of planned obsolescence, thus an exploitation and escalation of global resources and resultant hazardous outcomes continues. Citing selected writings by Victor Papanek, (1992), and Edwin Datschefski, (2006) provided an understanding of the misuse high impact advanced technologies imposes on the environment. These notions were discussed during the project and in relation to contemporary models of practice which currently use discarded materials to make objects for living.  Based on a survey observing the local homewares and furniture industries within Sydney, Australia, and recent published material, a niche market was discovered for challenging conventions of low seating objects. Initial sketches were transformed into marquettes then developed into full size prototypes of multi functional forms. a series of forms were scaled up, made of discarded materials using simple hand crafted processes and minimal production methods.  As a reference influences included architects, sculptors and craft practitioners who were examined particularly for their use of discarded materials or for their construction methods. During experimental studies visual source material drew upon an observation and analysis of architecture, skeletal structures and land formations.  In an exhibition originally titled, "Be Seated", these forms made as initial prototypes were exhibited at Kudos Gallery, Sydney, Australia, during May 2007. They were later refined and renamed as "Low Life" for a group exhibition "Contained"  held at Kudos Gallery during 2008.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- 21st century .</field><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journey to inner peace installation and sculpture from a buddhist perspective</field><field name="creator">Le Thua, Tien , Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">My Master of Fine Arts research project focuses on installation and sculpture that embodies the themes of Buddhism and War. My artwork examines how the two themes interact and influence each other. Making art, for me, is an intensely personal process of rediscovering myself. The project is an attempt to create a visual conversation between my personal experiences, memories and imagination. In particular, I explore the collective memory of the people of Hue in relation to the immediate past, and the longer historical heritage of the city and the region.  Chapter One provides a background to my personal experiences of growing up in Hue, Vietnam, during a time of war. This is a relevant starting point as these experiences have shaped my life and my art practice. This chapter begins with my childhood and charts my journey into art education. Visual art is the form and methodology by which I can best express my thoughts, dreams, and reflections. Through sculpture I can share my own vision and thoughts with people from different cultural backgrounds, ideally reaching beyond existing socio-cultural boundaries. It is a personal journey that has led me toward the path of re-discovering my inner world and awakening a forward-looking perspective.  Chapter Two explores the influence Buddhist philosophy has on my art practice. This chapter also discusses the work of four contemporary artists who are primarily concerned with themes of Buddhism and war. Through this research I explore how the philosophy of Buddhism gave me a new perspective on how an artist can live completely in the present, while building a bridge between the past and the future through creative practice. Buddhism is a process of everyday transformation; in practice it is an attempt to forge new beginnings in every facet of daily life.  Chapter Three discusses my earlier sculpture and installation artworks. I then examine how this led me to collaborate with other international contemporary artists who share a common aesthetic or theme.  Chapter Four examines my current art practice and discuss how I see it shaping my future art practice.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Buddhism.</field><field name="subject">Sculpture.</field><field name="subject">Installation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic analysis of assisted reproductive technologies</field><field name="creator">Chambers, Georgina Mary, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are widely accepted as clinically effective in the treatment of infertility. However, there is a scarcity of economic information to influence decision making. Four studies were undertaken to inform public health policy and clinical practice in relation to equitable and effective resource allocation of ART. Study One used a detailed cost-analysis and decision-analytic model of Australian ART registry data to calculate age-specific costs per live-birth (all maternal ages; AUD 32,903). Study Two expanded the methodology to analyse economic aspects of ART in selected developed countries. Treatment costs reflected the costliness of the underlying healthcare system, with cycle costs highest in the US (USD 12,513) and lowest in Japan (USD 3956). ART was expensive from a patient, but not from a societal perspective. Demand was price elastic in the midrange of consumer prices (USD 3000-6000). Only countries with funding arrangements which minimised out-of-pocket expenses met expected demand. The main complication of ART is the high incidence of iatrogenic multiple births. Additionally, ART singletons have poorer perinatal outcomes than non??ART singletons. Study Three quantified the inpatient costs of ART versus non??ART deliveries in Australia. The poorer perinatal outcomes of ART singletons translated into 31% higher birth??admission costs for ART compared to non??ART singletons. The combined maternal and infant birth??admission costs of ART twins and triplets were 3 and 11 times higher than for singletons. Study Four was undertaken as a clinical and cost??effectiveness analysis of IVF versus stimulated intrauterine insemination (IUI). One IVF treatment was more effective than two cycles of IUI; cumulative live??birth rates (39% and 28%, respectively) and mean time to pregnancy (69 days and 44 days, respectively). IVF was more costly but more effective than IUI, with an incremental-cost-effectiveness-ratio of an additional live-birth well within society??s willingness-to-pay. This thesis provides the first detailed economic analysis of ART in Australia, and the most comprehensive economic review of ART among developed countries. The methodologies developed were used to cost the main complications of ART, and to indicate that IVF is more effective than IUI as a first-line therapy for subfertility.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42057</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving the GPS Data Processing Algorithm for Precise Static Relative Positioning</field><field name="creator">Satirapod, Chalermchon, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since its introduction in the early 1980????s, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become an important tool for high-precision surveying and geodetic applications. Carrier phase measurements are the key to achieving high accuracy positioning results. This research addresses one of the most challenging aspects in the GPS data processing algorithm, especially for precise GPS static positioning, namely the definition of a realistic stochastic model. Major contributions of this research are: (a)	A comparison of the two data quality indicators, which are widely used to assist in the definition of the stochastic model for GPS observations, has been carried out. Based on the results obtained from a series of tests, both the satellite elevation angle and the signal-to-noise ratio information do not always reflect the reality. (b)	A simplified MINQUE procedure for the estimation of the variance-covariance components of GPS observations has been proposed. The proposed procedure has been shown to produce similar results to those from the standard MINQUE procedure. However, the computational load and time are significantly reduced, and in addition the effect of a changing number of satellites on the computations is effectively dealt with. (c)	An iterative stochastic modelling procedure has been developed in which all error features in the GPS observations are taken into account. Experimental results show that by applying the proposed procedure, both the certainty and the accuracy of the positioning results are improved. In addition, the quality of ambiguity resolution can be more realistically evaluated. (d)	A segmented stochastic modelling procedure has been developed to effectively deal with long observation period data sets, and to reduce the computational load. This procedure will also take into account the temporal correlations in the GPS measurements. Test results obtained from both simulated and real data sets indicate that the proposed procedure can improve the accuracy of the positioning results to the millimetre level. (e)	A novel approach to GPS analysis based on a combination of the wavelet decomposition technique and the simplified MINQUE procedure has been proposed. With this new approach, the certainty of ambiguity resolution and the accuracy of the positioning results are improved.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18244</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of illustrations when learning to read: a cognitive load theory approach.</field><field name="creator">Torcasio, Susannah Marie, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">When students are learning to read, the materials supplied typically will include extensive illustrations. The implicit assumption is that the inclusion of such illustrations will assist students in learning to read. Cognitive load theory suggests that this way of formatting learning materials may not be maximally effective as the inclusion of illustrations with written text constitutes redundant information that may interfere with learning. If working memory resources are devoted to the illustrations rather than the text, as is likely with young children, those resources will be unavailable to decipher the text. The elimination of redundant illustrations may thus enhance learning to read. Three experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of including illustrations in beginning reading materials. Experiment 1 compared reading materials consisting solely of simple prose passages with materials consisting of the same passages plus informative illustrations depicting the content of each passage. Reading proficiency improved more under the no illustrations condition. Experiment 2 compared the informative illustrations with uninformative illustrations. Reading proficiency improved more using uninformative illustrations. Experiment 3 compared uninformative illustrations with no illustrations and found no significant differences between these conditions. These results were interpreted within a cognitive load theory framework. It was concluded that informative illustrations are redundant and so impose an extraneous working memory load that interferes with learning to read.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognitive load theory.</field><field name="subject">Reading instruction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contaminant degradation using nanosized zero valent iron particles</field><field name="creator">Sun, Quan, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Zero-valent iron (ZVI) has been successfully used for the degradation of a wide range of organic contaminants in groundwaters in recent years. The rate of degradation of contaminants by ZVI may be enhanced by use of nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI) particles which possess higher surface area than the more widely used granular materials. However, the most widely used method of producing nZVI involves the reduction of FeIII by sodium borohydride is expensive. Dithionite can be used to reduce Fe(II) and produce cost effective nZVI under conditions of high pH and in the absence of oxygen. The efficiency of trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation using dithionite nZVI particles (nZVIS2O4) is similar to that of the conventional borohydride particles (nZVIBH4). Oxidation of benzoic acid using the nZVIS2O4 particles results in different byproducts than those produced when nZVIBH4 particles are used. The high concentration of phenol compared to hydroxybenzoic acids suggests that OH addition is not the primary oxidation pathway when one is using the nZVIS2O4 particles. It is proposed that sulfate radicals (SO4&#8722;) are produced as a result of hydroxyl radical attack on the sulfite matrix surrounding the nZVIS2O4 particles, with these radicals oxidizing benzoic acid via electron transfer reactions rather than addition reactions.  Low yields of oxidants limit the application of nZVI. It has recently been demonstrated that nZVI oxidative efficiency can be enhanced in presence of ethlylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Additional insight into the nZVI-mediated process has been obtained from comparative studies of degradation of benzoic acid by nZVI particles and Fenton reagents in the absence and presence of EDTA at different pH.  The efficiency of nZVI degradation is significantly hindered by the rapid aggregation of the iron nanoparticles, which may result in a decrease in available reactive surface area. These effects of aggregation can be overcome by surface modification through adsorption of capping agents which provide steric and electrosteric repulsive interactions between particles. Several high molecular weight (HMW) organic polymers have been used for preventing agglomeration of nZVI particles, such as water soluble starch, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and alginate. The degradation capabilities of different functionalized nZVIS2O4 particle were investigated. Iron-based bimetallic particles in which metals such as Pd and Ni have been combined with Fe, have been found to both enhance rates of halogenated organic contaminants reduction and generate more fully dehalogenated products relative to unamended iron. The results presented in this thesis demonstrate that formation of bimetallic particles with nZVI formed from the more cost effective dithionite reduction of ferrous salts also results in dramatic enhancement in reducing ability.  The oxidising ability of nZVIBH4 particles can be enhanced dramatically by addition of polyoxometallates (POMs), redox catalysts which result in enhanced production of hydrogen peroxide. The extent of enhancement is quantified by examination of the oxidation of formic acid (to CO2) and kinetic modelling of the results obtained used to investigate the mechanism of the POM-mediated oxidation process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nano</field><field name="subject">Iron</field><field name="subject">ZVI</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Flexibility in investment decisions under uncertainty: do managers behave according to real options theory?</field><field name="creator">Collins, Michael Alan, Strategy &amp; Entrepreneurship, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite the plethora of theoretical papers on real options, comparatively few papers test the predictions of real option theory empirically, and almost none directly examine decision making that applies real options theory. In contributing to the understanding of real options thinking, this research addresses the direct question of whether or not managers behave according to real options theory under controlled experimental conditions.  An additional contribution of this research is in the use of discrete choice experimentation as an instrument for studying real options decision-making. Whether managers would value two-stage capital investment decisions??as predicted by real options theory??was tested, as was the extent to which their preferences aligned with theory.  Managers?? responses corresponded, in part, with real options theory: investment values generally increased with lower option premiums and with higher payoffs. However, responses deviated significantly from real options theory when assessing the effect of uncertainty: respondents tended to incorrectly allocate lower values to investment alternatives with higher uncertainty. Responses also deviated significantly when assessing the effect of time to expiry: respondents tended to incorrectly allocate lower values to investment alternatives with longer times to expiry. This aspect is fundamental to real options theory and thus the findings of this research do not support real options thinking as being the best approximation of behaviour.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Control of a rotary blood pump</field><field name="creator">Karantonis, Dean, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Implantable rotary blood pumps (RBPs) are an emerging technology designed to provide sufferers of heart failure with a viable treatment option which improves their medical prognosis and quality of life. The broad aim of this thesis is to address the need for a pump control strategy, and develop a solution whereby the implant recipient??s physiological requirements are continuously monitored in a non-invasive manner and met with an appropriate response by the RBP.  Employing only the non-invasive signal of instantaneous pump impeller speed to assess flow dynamics, five physiologically significant pumping states have been identified in acute ex vivo porcine experiments (N=6). Two broader states, corresponding to normal and ventricular suction conditions, were readily discernable in clinical data from human implant recipients (N=10). Employing a classification and regression tree (CART) model, an automated real-time algorithm was developed to detect pumping states with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Both suction and normal states were detected without error in data from the animal experiments, and with a peak sensitivity/specificity, for detecting suction, of 99.11% / 98.76% in the human patient data.  Algorithms to non-invasively estimate RBP flow and differential pressure in both steady- and pulsatile-flow environments were developed. Taking the pump feedback signals of speed and power, together with the blood haematocrit (or equivalent viscosity) level, as input parameters, several estimation models were developed via polynomial surface fitting and/or system identification methods, yielding clinically acceptable results (mean flow errors of 3.09% and 5.49%, and mean pressure errors of 1.80% and 6.47%, for the steady- and pulsatile-flow cases, respectively).  An RBP control algorithm based on a non-invasive indicator of the implant recipient??s activity level has been proposed and evaluated in a software simulation environment. An Activity Level Index (ALI) forms the basis of an adaptive control module operating within a hierarchical multi-objective framework which imposes several constraints on the pump??s operating region. Three class IV heart failure cases of varying severity were simulated under rest and exercise conditions, and a comparison with other popular RBP control strategies was performed. Simulations of the proposed control algorithm exhibited the effective intervention of each constraint, resulting in an improved flow response and the maintenance of a safe operating condition, compared with other control modes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43474</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???Selling Consent???: From Authoritarianism to Welfarism at David Jones, 1838-1958</field><field name="creator">Pragnell, Bradley John, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisation Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the history of labour management at David Jones, the major Australian retailer and manufacturer, between the years 1838 and 1958.  This thesis examines the development of consent-based approach to labour management at David Jones, in particular the development of paternalism and welfarism.  In doing so this thesis explores both general questions regarding the factors that influence why certain firms adopt a consent-based approach to labour management, as well as informing debates around the existence of nineteenth century paternalism and the origins of twentieth century welfarism.  The historical material contained at the David Jones Archives and elsewhere reveals little evidence of paternalism as a deliberate management strategy.  This brings into question the usefulness of paternalism as a concept in the historical study of Australian labour management.  The inability to trace paternalism also undermines explanations of twentieth century welfarism premised on the pre-existence of nineteenth century paternalism.  The historical materials, however, do note that twentieth century welfarism was a deliberate labour management strategy adopted by David Jones management.  Welfarism, combined with systematic management and training, was initially adopted following the First World War to deal with the threat of industrial turmoil.  However, in the 1930s, welfarism increasingly became a pro-active strategy designed to create skilled selling and raise the profile of the firm within the community.  Further, welfarism at David Jones in the inter-war period was more than merely a new form of paternalism, somehow transformed by being in a larger, more bureaucratic setting or a result of employers confronted an increasingly feminised workforce. Welfarism at David Jones was a deliberate strategy, informed by overseas experiments, management consultants and the new science of psychology.  Welfarism at David Jones continued into the post World War Two period.  However, new forms of retailing, in particular self-service, undermined attempts to create skilled selling.  Elements of welfarism remain at David Jones and continue to support the firm???s corporate image as a provider of high-quality customer service.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">David Jones Limited</field><field name="subject">Department stores Australia History</field><field name="subject">Retail trade Australia Management</field><field name="subject">Clerks</field><field name="subject">Retail trade</field><field name="subject">Labor unions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18241</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations of ??universality plus difference??  as being a ??partial way of seeing??</field><field name="creator">Bacic, Anita, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">My body of work described in this thesis is a demonstration of my continued fascination as an artist with the cosmopolitanist outlook on life. In particular, the elements within this cosmopolitanist framework of universality and difference and their coexistence, as described by Kwame Anthony Appiah, are used as a means of exploring a partial way of seeing. This is explored by a series of works: OneSixty Characters, Roaming Sweets, Ringe Raja, and the final set of works using the camera obscura technique (Accidental Surveillance, Outside In, and Outside In/Inside Out). Universality is explored through the use of a number of cultural, and, in the case of the initial works, various technological means. Cultural devices used included nursery rhymes/songs, story-telling and archetypal imagery. Technological explorations included use of moving images, mobile phones, Bluetooth hardware and the Internet. Other elements of the universal included the dome??s representation of the world and moving cloud animations as depicted in Ringe Raja and natural light ?? the main feature of the last set of works.  The elements of difference presented included linguistic and cultural differences, and ultimately each individual??s own personal experiences. It is this that sets each of us apart from one another, and provides for each of us a partial way of seeing that is unique to ourselves. By exploring works that encourage us to seek answers to the way we look, see, and interpret the world around us, we use that which is familiar to us to try to find the answers. This is particularly relevant to the final work which removed all forms of contemporary technology and used natural light to provide a place for contemplation, where familiar sounds, images and our own archive of experiences was used as a reference base to assist in the interpretation of what was being experienced.  The intention of the work was not to provide all the answers to questions that arise among participants, but to encourage contemplation, an interaction with the environment, and with others.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epigenetic changes in breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Hinshelwood, Rebecca, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, UNSW</field><field name="description">Changes in the epigenetic landscape are widespread in neoplasia, with de novo methylation and histone repressive marks commonly occurring in association with gene silencing.  However, understanding the dynamics of epigenetic changes is often hindered due to the absence of adequate in vitro model systems that accurately reflect events occurring in vivo.  Human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) grown under standard culture conditions enter a growth arrest termed selection, but a subpopulation is able to escape from arrest and continue to proliferate.  These cells, called post-selection cells, have many of the hallmarks seen in the earliest lesions of breast cancer, including transcriptional silencing and hypermethylation of the p16INK4A tumour suppressor gene.  The overall aim of my thesis was to use post-selection HMECs as model system to identify and dissect the mechanism involved in early epigenetic aberrations.  Firstly, using a microarray approach, I found that multiple members of the TGF-&#946; signalling pathway were concordantly suppressed in post-selection cells, and this was associated with functional disruption of the TGF-&#946; pathway.  Interestingly, concordant gene suppression was not associated with aberrant DNA methylation, but with repressive chromatin remodelling.  Secondly, to further understand the mechanism underpinning epigenetic silencing, I demonstrated using laser capture technology, that p16INK4A silencing is a precursor to DNA methylation and histone remodelling.  Thirdly, I found that individual post-selection HMEC strains during the early passages shared a common 'wave' pattern of regional-specific methylation within the p16INK4A CpG island.  Interestingly, the 'wave' pattern of early de novo methylation correlated with the apparent footprint of nucleosomes within the p16INK4A CpG island.  Lastly, to further characterise the properties of the HMEC culture system, I demonstrated that post-selection cells do not possess a natural tumour-inducing property when transplanted into the mammary fat pad of immunocompromised mice.  However, post-selection HMECs were associated with high expression of a variety of stem/progenitor markers, as well as stem/progenitor associated polycomb genes, thus demonstrating that these cells share some common features of stem/progenitor cells.  The research presented in this thesis demonstrate that epigenetic changes occur early in the growth of post-selection HMECs and many of these changes are common in breast cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chromatin remodelling</field><field name="subject">Epigenetics</field><field name="subject">DNA methylation</field><field name="subject">Mechanism</field><field name="subject">Breast cancer</field><field name="subject">Human mammary epithelial cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43633</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy and public health: an evaluation of the Sydney medically supervised injecting centre</field><field name="creator">Salmon, Allison Maree, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">While supervised injecting facilities (SIF) can be found world-wide they remain politically sensitive and controversial public health policy initiatives and several important questions pertaining to SIFs remain unanswered. What type of evidence is necessary to validate controversial public health policy initiatives such as SIFs? How much evidence is enough to support public health policy initiatives to address the health of marginalised groups in our society such as injecting drug users? This thesis presents the results of a number of studies designed to evaluate the success of the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC) against its stated objectives.  Firstly, a background to Supervised Injecting Facilities (SIFs) generally and the Sydney MSIC specifically is provided, as well as a summary of evidence of their effectiveness to date. Secondly, a descriptive study is presented which is designed to assess the success of the MSIC in attracting a target population of high-risk IDUs and its success in providing a gateway to treatment. Thirdly, evidence of community support for the MSIC is presented, as are perceptions of drug-related public amenity prior to and following Sydney MSIC establishment, based on repeat cross-sectional random surveys. Presented next are the findings of an ecological study investigating the success of the MSIC against its stated objective of decreasing overdose deaths using three different indicators. The final empirical chapter presents a prospective observational study which investigates the potential impact of MSIC utilisation on levels of public injecting drug use among a client cohort. The findings of these studies are then integrated with existing evidence relating to the effectiveness of SIFs and critically reviewed according to the hierarchy of evidence framework. Finally, a way forward in assessing the effectiveness of SIFs, and other controversial public health initiatives, is presented in the form of an alternative public health-focussed framework.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43801</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topics in navigation and guidance of wheeled robots</field><field name="creator">Teimoori Sangani, Hamid, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Navigation and guidance of mobile robots towards steady or maneuvering objects (targets) is one of the most important areas of robotics that has attracted a lot of attention in recent decades. However, in most of the existing methods, both the line-of-sight angle (bearing) and the relative distance (range) are assumed to be available for navigation and guidance algorithms. There is also a relatively large body of research on navigation and guidance with bearings-only measurements. In contrast, only a few results on navigation and guidance towards an unknown target using range-only measurements have been published.  Various problems of navigation, guidance, location estimation and target tracking based on range-only measurements often arise in new wireless networks related applications. Recent advances in these applications allow us to use inexpensive transponders and receivers for range-only measurements which provide information in dynamic and noisy environments without the necessity of line-of-sight. To take advantage of these sensors, algorithms must be developed for range-only navigation.  The main part of this thesis is concerned with the problem of real-time navigation and guidance of Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) towards an unknown stationary or moving target using range-only measurements. The range can be estimated using the signal strength and the robust extended Kalman filtering. Several similar algorithms for navigation and guidance termed Equiangular Navigation and Guidance (ENG) laws are proposed and mathematically rigorous proofs of convergence and stability of the proposed guidance laws are given. The experimental investigation into the use of range data for a WMR navigation is documented and the results and discussions on the performance of the proposed guidance strategies are presented, where a wheeled robot successfully approach a stationary or follow a maneuvering target.  In order to safely navigate and reliably operate in populated environments, ENG is then modified into Augmented-ENG (AENG), which enables the robot to approach a stationary target or follow an unpredictable maneuvering object in an unknown environment, while keeping a safe distance from the target, and simultaneously preserving a safety margin from the obstacles. Furthermore, we propose and experimentally investigate a new biologically inspired method for local obstacle avoidance and give the mathematically rigorous proof of the idea. In order for the robot to avoid collision and bypass the enroute obstacles in this method, the angle between the instantaneous moving direction of the robot and a reference point on the surface of the obstacle is kept constant. The proposed idea is combined with the ENG law, which leads to a reliable and fast long-range navigation. The performance of both navigation strategy and local obstacle avoidance techniques are confirmed with computer simulations and several experiments with ActivMedia Pioneer 3-DX wheeled robots.  The second part of the thesis investigates some challenging problems in the area of wheeled robot navigation. We first address the problem of bearing-only guidance of an autonomous vehicle following a moving target with smaller minimum turning radius compared to that of the follower and propose a simple and constructive navigation law. In compliance with the increasing research on decentralized control laws for groups of mobile autonomous robots, we consider the problems of decentralized navigation of network of WMRs with limited communication and decentralized stabilization of formation of WMRs. New control laws are presented and simulation results are provided to illustrate the control laws and their applications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obstacle avoidance.</field><field name="subject">Wheeled mobile robot.</field><field name="subject">Navigation.</field><field name="subject">Formation Control.</field><field name="subject">UAV.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43709</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Off-gas Nitrous Oxide monitoring for nitrification aeration control</field><field name="creator">Sivret, Eric Claude, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Effective control of nitrification processes employed at municipal wastewater treatment plants is essential for maintaining process reliability and minimizing environmental impacts and operating costs. While a range of process control strategies are available, they share a dependence on invasive liquid phase monitoring and are based on a periphery understanding of the metabolic status of the processes being controlled. Utilization of off-gas nitrous oxide (N2O) monitoring as a real-time indicator of the process metabolic status is a novel process control concept with the potential to address these concerns. This thesis details the development and evaluation of an off-gas N2O stress response based control technique. Examination of the stress response relationship demonstrated that it met the majority of the criteria of interest for process control. A simple feedback aeration control strategy was developed and evaluated through process simulation to determine the feasibility of implementation, cost effectiveness and associated environmental benefits. The off-gas N2O based control strategy provided better matching between aeration supply and metabolic demand, allowing the process to be maintained at the desired operating setpoints and avert nitrification failure. Performance was demonstrated to be similar to dissolved oxygen based feedback aeration control, although slightly more efficient at reduced dissolved oxygen concentrations. A technical, economic and environmental evaluation indicated that aeration control based on non-invasive off-gas N2O monitoring is technically feasible and has the potential to offer significant environmental and economic benefits including reductions in operating costs and process capital investment, as well as improved effluent compliance and reductions in emissions of gaseous pollutants including greenhouse gases. Overall, while off-gas N2O monitoring based aeration control techniques have the potential to provide significant economic and environmental benefits, a number of research questions remain to be answered. Future work in the form of long-term field trials is required to address these issues and allow quantification of economic and environmental benefits.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Off-gas.</field><field name="subject">Nitrification.</field><field name="subject">Aeration control.</field><field name="subject">N2O.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43702</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Risk, resilience and redemption: situating Hepatitis C in the lives of Indo-Chinese injecting drug users</field><field name="creator">Coupland, Heidi Kever, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Prevention and treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) among injecting drug users (IDUs) is a public health priority in many countries around the world. However, there has been limited research that explores cultural differences in IDUs?? approaches to HCV prevention and treatment. In Australia, previous research indicates that Indo-Chinese IDUs (Cambodian, Lao and Vietnamese) are an important group to target in HCV-related public health interventions.  This ethnographic study aimed to explore Indo-Chinese IDUs?? explanatory models of HCV and their influence on HCV-related prevention and treatment-seeking. Data were used to inform the development of a brief intervention (BI) about HCV treatment and its availability at a tertiary liver clinic. A trial of the BI was then conducted, to identify barriers to treatment uptake experienced by this group.   Participants?? explanatory models of HCV were syncretic and diverse within and between cultural groups. However, the study found that participants?? approaches to HCV prevention and treatment-seeking were predominantly influenced by a cultural context heavily shaped by the stigma associated with injecting drug use. In participants?? local worlds, social, structural and institutional forces exacerbated their marginalization and often positioned mainstream public health advice regarding HCV prevention and treatment as irrelevant or out of reach. Participants?? narratives of suffering, diminishing hope for the future and ??spoiled identity?? revealed how health promotion messages could act as a form of symbolic violence when they do not reflect the everyday constraints experienced by affected communities.  Hepatitis C was situated in participants?? lives relative to ??what mattered most?? (Kleinman, 2006), including the centrality of family obligations, upholding principles of loyalty and reciprocity within social networks and seeking redemption, through cultural maintenance, ??repaying?? parents and cessation of injecting drug use. Despite a plethora of barriers to becoming ??redeemed??, seeking redemption represented hope for the future and underscored many participants?? resilience and acceptance of suffering. Public health interventions targeting hepatitis C prevention and treatment uptake need to be situated in local, ??cultural?? realities, address key features of the risk environment and create hope rather than perpetuate social suffering among marginalised IDUs.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42592</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ecological allegory: a study of four post-colonial Australian novels</field><field name="creator">Fonteyn, David Michael, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This  thesis examines  four novels as case studies of the mode of allegory in post-colonial Australian literature  Allegory is a mode of fiction in which a hidden narrative is concealed below a surface narrative. Furthermore, when the hidden narrative is revealed, the surface narrative and its discursive codes become transformed. Post-colonial critics have argued that one aspect of post-colonial literature is the use of allegory in a way that the hidden narrative interpolates the surface narrative. This process of allegorical interpolation is one of the ways post-colonial literature is able to transform colonial discourses.  Through an analysis of the four novels, I argue that allegory is a significant aspect of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian writing in its depiction of the natural environment and the settler nation. Bringing together ecological theory with post-colonial theories of allegory, I coin the term 'ecological allegory' to describe a specific type of allegory in which nature as subject becomes revealed within the 'hidden' narrative of the text. Through this process of interpolation, the literary representation of the land is being transformed as the natural environment is depicted as a dialogical subject.  In the explication of the four novels as ecological allegories, I provide new readings of two canonical Australian texts, Remembering Babylon and Tourmaline, as well as, readings of two lesser known Indigenous Australian texts, Earth and Steam Pigs. I argue that theories of ecology provide a means for understanding the texts' representation of nature as subject. The allegorical mode of the novels offers a literary form whereby the natural environment as subject may be able to be represented in discursive language. Furthermore, in these allegories, the polysemy in the written mode of Australian literature is able to express the oral Indigenous worldview of Country, the land as a living entity. The claim that these texts are constructed as allegories, rather than simply reading the texts allegorically (known as allegoresis), combined with the methodology of ecological theory, to create a new term - ecological allegory - is an original way of reading Australian literature. Furthermore, my term 'ecological allegory' is an innovation in literary theory and its understanding of literary representations of the natural environment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Allegory</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A glycoproteomic approach to the structural characterization of acidic glycoproteins</field><field name="creator">Estrella, Ruby Poblete, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Glycoproteins, and their subset proteoglycans, are an important group of molecules in joint tissues, providing crucial functions such as cartilage structural integrity and lubrication at cartilage surfaces.   The functionality of these glycoproteins is attributable to their oligosaccharide components, however surprisingly little is known about their fine structural details.   With the use of glycoproteomic methods, this thesis presents the development and incorporation of mass spectrometric, biochemical and immunological methods to elucidate glycoprotein structures in synovial fluids, chondrocytes and synoviocytes in order to provide insight into how their structures may contribute to their functions.  Initially, anion exchange chromatography was used to extract the acidic fraction containing glycoproteins and proteoglycans in arthritic synovial fluid (SF) samples, followed by proteomic analysis to identify the main glycoproteins in 1D-SDS-PAGE gels. To complement these findings, an in-gel enzymatic digest method for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and oligosaccharide analysis was developed for analysis of glycoproteins by graphitised carbon liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Further  characterization of the major glycoprotein, lubricin, was pursued by investigating its interactions with the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) from its cellular sources and characterising the secreted lubricin with Western blot and proteomic analysis.  Finally, the  graphitised carbon LC-MS method was applied to analyse the overall glycosylation profiles of lubricin. The major glycoprotein found in arthritic synovial fluid was lubricin, as identified by peptide LC-MS and Western blot.  Graphitised carbon LC-MS identified the major chondroitin sulfate (CS) repeat region disaccharides and linkage region oligosaccharides of aggrecan with confirmation through tandem mass spectra and Western blots using CS linkage region stub antibodies.  Application of this method to lubricin led to the discovery of O-linked oligosaccharide structures which were previously undescribed for lubricin. A higher proportion of sialylated oligosaccharide structures were detected in the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) samples compared to the osteoarthritic (OA) samples, which signifies a diagnostic difference between these diseases.  Sulfated oligosaccharide structures were also detected on synovial fluid lubricin, correlated with Western blot reactivity with the MECA-79 antibody, thus suggesting a role for lubricin in inflammation. Overall the results demonstrated that glycosylation structure indicates additional functional properties for the glycoproteins such as lubricin.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteoglycans</field><field name="subject">Glycoproteomics</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="subject">Lubricin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The BUMP model of response planning: a neuroengineering account of speed-accuracy tradeoffs, velocity profiles, and physiological tremor in movement</field><field name="creator">Bye, Robin Trulssen, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Speed-accuracy tradeoffs, velocity profiles, and physiological tremor are fundamental characteristics of human movement. The principles underlying these phenomena have long attracted major interest and controversy. Each is well established experimentally but as yet they have no common theoretical basis. It is proposed that these three phenomena occur as the direct consequence of a movement response planning system that acts as an intermittent optimal controller operating at discrete intervals of ~100 ms. The BUMP model of response planning describes such a system. It forms the kernel of adaptive model theory which defines, in computational terms, a basic unit of motor production or BUMP. Each BUMP consists of three processes: (i) analysing sensory information, (ii) planning a desired optimal response, and (iii) executing that response. These processes operate in parallel across successive sequential BUMPs. The response planning process requires a discrete time interval in which to generate a minimum acceleration trajectory of variable duration, or horizon, to connect the actual response with the predicted future state of the target and compensate for executional error. BUMP model simulation studies show that intermittent adaptive optimal control employing two extremes of variable horizon predictive control reproduces almost exactly findings from several authoritative human experiments. On the one extreme, simulating spatially-constrained movements, a receding horizon strategy results in a logarithmic speed-accuracy tradeoff and accompanying asymmetrical velocity profiles. On the other extreme, simulating temporally-constrained movements, a fixed horizon strategy results in a linear speed-accuracy tradeoff and accompanying symmetrical velocity profiles. Furthermore, simulating ramp movements, a receding horizon strategy closely reproduces experimental observations of 10 Hz physiological tremor. A 100 ms planning interval yields waveforms and power spectra equivalent to those of joint-angle, angular velocity and electromyogram signals recorded for several speeds, directions, and skill levels of finger movement. While other models of response planning account for one or other set of experimentally observed features of speed-accuracy tradeoffs, velocity profiles, and physiological tremor, none accounts for all three. The BUMP model succeeds in explaining these disparate movement phenomena within a single framework, strengthening this approach as the foundation for a unified theory of motor control and planning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optimal control</field><field name="subject">Motor planning</field><field name="subject">Movement invariants</field><field name="subject">Minimum acceleration trajectory</field><field name="subject">Submovements</field><field name="subject">Intermittency</field><field name="subject">Variability</field><field name="subject">Predictive control</field><field name="subject">Physiological tremor</field><field name="subject">Speed-accuracy tradeoff</field><field name="subject">Velocity profile</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43542</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereo vision based obstacle avoidance in indoor environments</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Tekkie Tak-Kei, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an indoor obstacle avoidance system for car-like mobile robot. The system consists of stereo vision, map building, and path planning. Stereo vision is performed on stereo images to create a geometric map of the environment. A fast sparse stereo approach is employed. For different areas of the image there are different optimal values of disparity range. A multi-pass method to combine results at different disparity range is proposed. To reduce computational complexity the matching is limited to areas that are likely to generate useful data. The stereo vision system outputs a more complete disparity map. Abstract Map building involves converting the disparity map into map coordinates using triangulation and generating a list of obstacles. Occupancy grids are built to aid a hierarchical collision detection. The fast collision detection method is used by the path planner. Abstract A steering set path planner calculates a path that can be directly used by a car-like mobile robot. An adaptive approach using occupancy grid information is proposed to improve efficiency. Using a non-fixed steering set the path planner spends less computation time in areas away from obstacles. The path planner populates a discrete tree to generate a smooth path. Two tree population methods were trialled to execute the path planner. The methods are implemented and experimented on a real car-like mobile robot.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">path planning</field><field name="subject">stereo vision</field><field name="subject">obstacle avoidance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43545</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Alcohol, endotoxin and the pancreas (induction, progression and reversibility of alcoholic pancreatitis)</field><field name="creator">Vonlaufen, Alain, Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis pertains to the pathogenesis of alcoholic pancreatitis, a considerable burden in terms of morbidity, mortality and health related costs. It has long been known that only a minority of alcoholics develop clinically evident pancreatitis, suggesting that (an) additional trigger factor(s) is required to elicit overt disease. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide LPS), from gut-derived gram negative bacteria may be one such trigger factor, since alcoholics exhibit increased levels of serum endotoxin. In addition, the degree of endotoxinaemia has been reported to correlate with the severity of pancreatitis. Studies described in this thesis report, i) the development of a novel rodent model of alcoholic pancreatitis produced by challenging alcohol-fed animals with single or repeated doses of LPS. The animals exhibit features of  both acute (acinar vacuolisation, necrosis, pancreatic oedema, haemorrhage and inflammatory infiltration) and chronic (acinar atrophy and pancreatic fibrosis) pancreatitis; ii) the reversion of pancreatic injury (including fibrosis) upon withdrawal of alcohol in the model and the persistence of pancreatic damage with continuation of alcohol feeding; iii) activation of pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs, known to play a central role in fibrogenesis) in vivo and in vitro by alcohol and LPS; iv) the inhibition of PSC apoptosis in vivo and in vitro upon exposure to alcohol and LPS and the induction of PSC apoptosis in vivo upon withdrawal of alcohol from the diet and v) the presence of LPS receptors TLR4 and CD14 on PSCs, which would explain the responsiveness of PSCs to LPS.  Thus the work in this thesis provides strong evidence in support of endotoxin as a clinically relevant trigger factor for the initiation of alcoholic pancreatitis and as a factor that promotes disease progression. The thesis also provides the first experimental evidence to support the clinical reports of a beneficial effect of abstinence on chronic pancreatitis. Delineation of the mechanisms mediating the induction, progression and reversibility of alcoholic pancreatitis has the potential to direct the development of new therapeutic interventions for alcohol-related pancreatic injury.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stellate cells.</field><field name="subject">Alcoholic pancreatitis.</field><field name="subject">Fibrosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43721</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracing the invisible</field><field name="creator">Greig, Anne, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project stems from a personal experience, when I saw an image of my magnified blood cells skimming erratically across a computer screen. This interaction with technology and parts of myself that are usually unseen prompted my explorations into this area of research -  the realm of the invisible. This broad and fascinating field of enquiry has preoccupied artists for millennia and has led me into an exploration of art, science and philosophy and how these disciplines have explored the realms beyond the senses. In particular, I have found that a convergence of these previously independent areas of thought is manifesting within contemporary culture as the advance of technology reveals more and more the mysteries of the universe. Developments in physics and cosmology, in particular, challenge our ideas about reality and how we perceive it, and raise questions about our place within the scheme of things that are having a big impact on contemporary thought.  My project engages with a cluster of issues concerning the impact of technology on visual representation. My area of studio practice is contemporary painting. In this exegesis I establish the context for my project by showing how advances in technology have influenced our visual representations of reality, and how these developments have always been and continue to be an area of fascination to artists.  We are currently subject to vast amounts of information and an abundance of visual material emanating from science and technology, which has not only permeated the popular imagination but has influenced our conceptions of how we represent the universe. Lens-based technologies continue to reveal information that challenges and alters our understanding of the underlying structure of the physical world and beyond. At the microscopic end of the scale scientists search amongst sub-atomic particles for new dimensions, whilst information from deep space reveals the ripples from the beginning of time - the big bang. At the same time, the fractal geometry of chaos theory makes visible the shapes embedded in the fabric of motion; the self-similarity of fractals are a way of seeing infinity.  This paper locates my project within this area of visual enquiry via a discussion of the work of some contemporary artists who share an interest in this broad and perhaps limitless field. In painting, this field has its origins in the pioneering abstractionists of the early 20th Century, who were also influenced by the scientific and technological advances of their time. Within this discussion I have situated the relevant scientific developments that relate both to the historical trajectory of art and to my own practice, as well as engage with some of the philosophical issues that arise from this subject.  Chapter one introduces a convergence of science and philosophy, where current cosmology points to a metaphysical notion of holism in which all things are interconnected. Chapter two discusses how the advance of lens-based technologies to probe the unseen realms in the early 20th Century influenced representations of a world beyond appearances that had a huge impact on artists. Chapter three looks at how our developing knowledge of natural systems influenced biomorphic abstraction in early 20th Century painting and links the exploration of chance and automatism in Dadaism with scientific notions of randomness and uncertainty. Chapter four discusses the contemporary field and how the practice of artists such as Ross Bleckner and Mark Francis, among others, have also produced a technological aesthetic influenced by developments in representation stemming from physics and cosmology. Chapter five locates my own studio practice within this context and describes the motivations and processes integral to my work in relation to the metaphysical implications of the field of enquiry that this project engages with.  When viewed within this context of art, philosophy and science, the final outcome of my project is an exploration of the unity of the underlying structure of existence.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43659</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaporated solid-phase crystallised poly-silicon thin film solar cells on glass</field><field name="creator">Kunz, Oliver, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cost of photovoltaic electricity needs to be significantly reduced in order to achieve a high electricity market penetration.  Thin-film solar cells have good potential to achieve such cost savings though (i) large-area deposition onto low-cost foreign substrates, (ii) more streamlined processing, (iii) monolithic cell interconnection, and very efficient use of the expensive semiconductor material.  Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) on glass is a promising technology for the cost-effective large volume production of PV modules since it (i) makes use of an abundant raw material, (ii) is non-toxic, (iii) does not suffer from light-induced degradation, and (iv) does not rely on TCO layers.  Usually plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PECVD) is used for the layer formation.  This thesis explores the use of e-beam evaporation as deposition method since it is potentially much faster and cheaper than PECVD.  The resulting solar cells are referred to as EVA (from EVAporation).  Two inherent shunting mechanisms in EVA cells are demonstrated to be shunting through sub-micron sized pinholes when the back electrode is deposited and shunting between the emitter and the absorber layer at the glass-side electrode.  Through the improved understanding of these shunting mechanisms it was possible to develop a suitable metallisation scheme for EVA cells using an aligned deposition of emitter and back surface field line contacts and a specially developed shunt mitigation etching technique.  For the first time appreciable efficiencies of up to 5.2% were demonstrated on this material.  It was also shown that only very lightly doped absorber layers can lead to the required high short-circuit currents in EVA cells.  The resulting cells are currently completely limited by space charge region recombination occurring with comparatively low ideality factors of only ~ 1.4  This thesis also demonstrates the usefulness of Jsc-Suns measurements and investigates optical loss mechanisms in the current devices.  Advanced modelling of distributed series resistance effects, influencing Suns-Voc, m-Voc and Jsc-Suns curves, is employed.  PC1D modelling is used to extract relevant device parameters.  In this work it was found that the diffusion length in the best EVA cells is longer than the absorber layer and that insufficient light trapping is currently the major hurdle to higher cell efficiencies.  From the obtained results it can be concluded that EVA solar cells are promising candidates for the low-cost and high-volume production of solar modules.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycrystalline silicon</field><field name="subject">Polycrystalline silicon</field><field name="subject">Silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="subject">Evaporated silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43644</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression of human emotion as an aspect of timelessness in single figure painting</field><field name="creator">Grace, Mauree, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This MFA project aims to express a particular range of emotions in an attempt to convey a sense of timelessness through a series of single figure paintings done from life.

The first series of experiments (Chapter 2) used a within-subject one-trial blocking design to study whether opioid receptors mediate a direct action of predictive error on Pavlovian association formation. Systemic administrations of the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone or intra-vlPAG administrations of the selective &#956;-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP prior to Stage II training prevented one-trial blocking. These results show for the first time that opioid receptors mediate the direct actions of predictive error on Pavlovian association formation. The second series of experiments (Chapter 3) then studied temporal-difference prediction errors during Pavlovian fear conditioning. In Stage I rats received CSA ?? shock pairings. In Stage II they received CSA/CSB ?? shock pairings that blocked learning to CSB. In Stage III, a serial overlapping compound, CSB &#8594; CSA, was followed by shock. The change in intra-trial durations supported fear learning to CSB but reduced fear of CSA, revealing the selective operation of temporal-difference prediction errors. This bi-directional change in responding was prevented by systemic NMDA receptor antagonism prior to Stage III training. In contrast opioid receptor antagonism differentially affected the learning taking place during Stage III, enhancing learning to CSB while impairing the loss of fear to CSA. The final series of experiments (Chapter 4) then examined potential neuroanatomical loci for the systemic effects reported in Chapter 3. It was observed that intra-BLA infusion of ifenprodil, an antagonist of NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit, prevented all learning during Stage III, whereas intra-vlPAG infusion of the &#956;-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP facilitated learning to CSB but impaired learning to CSA. These results are consistent with the suggestion that opioid receptors in the vlPAG provide an important contribution to learning. Importantly, this contribution of the vlPAG is over and above its role in producing the freezing conditioned response. Furthermore, the findings of this thesis identify complementary but dissociable roles for amygdala NMDA receptors and vlPAG &#956;-opioid receptors in predictive fear learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">prediction</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">blocking</field><field name="subject">opioid</field><field name="subject">PAG</field><field name="subject">NMDA</field><field name="subject">BLA</field><field name="subject">temporal-difference</field><field name="subject">rat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43546</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cerebellar synaptic plasticity in two animal models of muscular dystrophy</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Jennifer Louise, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and congenital muscular dystrophy 1A (MDC1A) are the two most common forms of muscular dystrophy in humans, caused by mutations in dystrophin and laminin &#945;2 genes respectively. Both are severe forms of the disease that lead to premature death due and are both now known to have a significant effect on the central nervous system. This project investigated the role of both proteins involved in each of these diseases in cerebellar Purkinje cells of two murine models of disease: the mdx mouse a dystrophin-deficient model of DMD and the dy2J a laminin &#945;2-deficient murine model of MDC1A. In the case of dystrophin further studies were undertaken in order to determine if increasing age had any effects on cerebellar function. It was found that there is no difference in electrophysiological characteristics (RMP, IR, eEPSP) of the cells when compared to appropriate control groups, nor was there any difference when young and aged dystrophin-deficient mdx groups were compared. Evoked IPSP characteristics were examined in young mdx cerebellar Purkinje cells and again no difference was found when compared to wildtype. There was a significant difference in response to the GABAA antagonist bicuculline, with wildtype increasing eEPSP amplitude by almost double that found in mdx. There was no difference in short term plasticity as measured by paired pulse facilitation in any of these groups. There was no difference in paired pulse depression at the inhibitory interneuron- Purkinje cell synapse of young wildtype and mdx cerebellar Purkinje cells. There a significant blunting of long term depression (LTD, (a form of long term synaptic plasticity) between young wildtype and mdx.

There was also significant differences in LTD found when littermate controls were compared to dy2J (laminin &#945;2 mutants). A third of the phenotypic animals (dy2J) potentiated. Finally when rebound potentiation (a GABA-ergic form of long term synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum) was compared in young wildtype and mdx mice, mdx mice displayed depression, rather than the expected potentiation in contrast to potentiation (or no change) as seen in all wildtype cells.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">laminin alpha2</field><field name="subject">muscular dystrophy</field><field name="subject">dystrophin</field><field name="subject">cerebellum</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antibacterial polyurethane nanocomposites for urinary devices</field><field name="creator">Fong, Nicole Wei Shi, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hospital-acquired infections are a significant contributor to clinically-related morbidity and mortality.

It is hypothesised that the enhanced barrier properties of PUNCs, afforded by the incorporation of well-dispersed nanoinclusions, would allow for the sustained release of an antimicrobial agent. The objectives of this research were to investigate the antibacterial, mechanical and barrier properties of PUNCs incorporating various silicates modified using antimicrobials, hypothesised to also act as dispersing agents. Organically modified silicates (OMS) were prepared at 110%, 200% and 300% cationic exchange capacity (CEC) using the biocide, chlorhexidine diacetate (CHX), which was hypothesised to perform the dual functions; dispersant and antibacterial agent. Resulting OMS were incorporated at 1wt% and 5wt% loadings into a PU matrix to produce PUNCs; PEU-CHX1.1MMT, PEU-CHX2.0MMT, and PEU-CHX3.0MMT, respectively. CHX performed well as a dispersant, producing intercalated to partially exfoliated PUNCS. Antibacterial activity was dependent on OMS type and loading. PEU-CHX1.1MMT materials had poor antibacterial properties, but the addition of free CHX into the materials significantly improved their efficacy, demonstrating long-term sterility in an in vitro urinary tract (UT) model. PEU-CHX2.0MMT and PEU-CHX3.0MMT at 5wt% OMS loadings had partially exfoliated structures and excellent antibacterial activity. Cytotoxicity was evident in all materials, although to a lesser extent in the latter. Overall, intermediate OMS loadings of CHX2.0MMT would be expected to produce PUNCs with favourable antibacterial activity and cytocompatibility. PUNC drug-release profiles demonstrated sustained release compared to pristine PU, indicative of enhanced barrier properties. Their ultimate tensile properties decreased with increased OMS loading or addition of free CHX.Higher cationic-exchanged OMS caused significant reductions in strain. Young's modulus increased in response to higher %CEC OMS and loading. PUNCs show promise as antibacterial biomaterials for long-term urinary applications, where antimicrobial release and mechanical properties can be modulated through organic modification and OMS loading.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibacterial</field><field name="subject">Nanocomposite</field><field name="subject">Polyurethane</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43627</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of neurostimulation via a suprachoroidal vision prosthesis</field><field name="creator">Wong, Yan Tat, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microelectronic vision prostheses aim to restore visual percepts through electrical stimulation of the surviving visual pathways in the blind. Electrical stimulation has been shown to produce spots of light in the visual field. A neurostimulator that forms the basis of a vision prosthesis was designed using a high voltage CMOS process to allow it to be able to stimulate when faced with high electrode-tissue impedances. It was implemented with novel features that allow it to be scalable, and to focus charge injection, and can stimulate multiple sites simultaneously using a current source and sink at each site. To reduce electrical cross-talk between multiple stimulation sites, six-return electrodes surround each stimulating electrode, electrically guarding them from each other. The six-return electrode configuration was shown to reduce electrical cross-talk in saline bath tests compared to single-return electrode configurations.  The neurostimulator was used to evoke responses from cats through electrical stimulation via intravitreal ball electrodes, corneal electrodes, and planar electrode arrays in the suprachoroidal space. Responses were measured on the visual cortex through optical imaging of intrinsic signals, and through surface electrodes. Using the planar electrode array in the suprachoroidal space, responses were elicited to biphasic, bipolar and monopolar stimuli, with each stimulating electrode coupled with either six-return electrodes, two-return electrodes, or a single-return electrode. The average charge threshold to elicit a response for biphasic, bipolar stimulation with six-return electrodes was 76.47 ?? 8.76 nC (standard error of the mean). For biphasic, bipolar stimulation, the magnitude and area of cortical response with the six-return electrode configurations was on average 2.18 ?? 0.19 times smaller than single-return electrode configurations, and 1.89 ?? 0.19 times smaller than two-return electrode configurations (P &lt; 0.0001). It was also found that for biphasic stimulation, a greater magnitude and area of response was elicited for monopolar stimulation compared to bipolar stimulation. This dissertation details the design and testing of a novel, scalable neurostimulator to focus charge injection. It also shows that suprachoroidal, bipolar stimulation can elicit visual responses, and that the area of cortical activation was more focused when using bipolar, biphasic stimulation, and six-return electrodes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Suprachoroidal stimulation</field><field name="subject">Vision prosthesis</field><field name="subject">Optical imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43654</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurement and time series analysis of emotion in music</field><field name="creator">Schubert, Emery, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relations among emotions and musical features and their changes with time, based on the assertion that there exist underlying, culturally specific, quantifiable rules which govern these relations.  I designed, programmed and tested a computer controlled Two-Dimensional Emotion Space (2DES) which administered and controlled all aspects of the experimental work.  The 2DES instrument consisted of two bipolar emotional response (ER) dimensions: valence (happiness-sadness) and arousal (activeness-sleepiness).  The instrument had a test-retest reliability exceeding 0.83 (p &amp;gt 0.01, N = 28) when words and pictures of facial expressions were used as the test stimuli.  Construct validity was quantified (r &amp;lt 0.84,  p &amp;gt 0.01). The 2DES was developed to collect continuous responses to recordings of four movements of music (N = 67) chosen to elicit responses in all quadrants of the 2DES: &amp;quotMorning&amp;quot from Peer Gynt, Adagio from Rodrigo???s Concierto de Aranjuez (Aranjuez), Dvorak???s Slavonic Dance Op 42, No. 1 and Pizzicato Polka by Strauss.  Test-retest reliability was 0.74 (p &amp;gt 0.001, N = 14).  Five salient and objectively quantifiable features of the musical signal (MFs) were scaled and used for time series analysis of the stimuli: melodic pitch, tempo, loudness, frequency spectrum centroid (timbral sharpness) and texture (number of different instruments playing).  A quantitative analysis consisted of: (1) first order differencing to remove trends, (2) determination of suitable, lagged MFs to keep as regressors via stepwise regression, and (3) regression of each ER onto selected MFs with first order autoregressive adjustment for serial correlation. Regression coefficients indicated that first order differenced (???) loudness and ???tempo had the largest correlations with ???arousal across all pieces, and ???melodic pitch correlated with ???valence for Aranjuez (p &amp;gt 0.01 for all coefficients).  The models were able to explain up to 73% of mean response variance.  Additional variation was explained qualitatively as being due to interruptions, interactions and collinearity:  The minor key and dissonances in a tonal context moved valence toward the negative direction; Short duration and perfect cadences moved valence in the positive direction.  The 2DES measure and serial correlation adjusted regression models were, together, shown to be powerful tools for understanding relations among musical features and emotional response.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Philosophy and aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Musical analysis</field><field name="subject">Emotion</field><field name="subject">Time series analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18268</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Designing functional magnetic nanoparticles with flame spray pyrolysis for bio-applications</field><field name="creator">Li, Dan, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) hold great promise in the fields of biology and medicine. The synthesis of functional MNPs with precisely controlled crystallographic, physicochemical, and magnetic properties on a large scale still remains the challenge today. This thesis reports the exploration of liquid-fed flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) in the synthesis of functional MNPs, their surface modifications, and potential bio-applications. Superparamagnetic and ferromagnetic maghemite (&#947;-Fe2O3) nanoparticles, and silica-coated maghemite (SiO2/&#947;-Fe2O3) nanocomposites were synthesised using FSP. The size of &#947;-Fe2O3 was controllable from 6 to 53 nm, with morphology evolving from a disordered near-spherical shape to fully ordered 2-D hexagonal/octagonal platelet. The saturation magnetisation (Ms) increased from 21 to 74 emu/g with increasing particle size, up to 13 nm when Ms approached the bulk &#947;-Fe2O3 characteristics. In the case of SiO2/&#947;-Fe2O3, three distinct morphologies, namely the single segregated &#947;-Fe2O3 core- SiO2 shell, transitional mixed morphologies, and multi &#947;-Fe2O3 cores embedded in submicron SiO2 shell, were obtained. The core size, composite size, and morphology of &#947;- Fe2O3 were tunable by varying %SiO2 loading and the use of a quartz tube enclosure during flame synthesis. The magnetic behaviour correlated well with the crystal microstructure. Following the core particle design, protein adsorption-desorption behaviour on FSP-madeMNPs was studied. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) adsorption was found to follow the Langmuir isotherm, with high binding capacities (150&#8722;348 mg BSA/g particle) and fast association constants. Electrostatically governed BSA orientations were proposed for different particle-buffer systems. The adsorbed BSA was effectively recovered by pH-shift using K2HPO4. Subsequently, terminal amine, aldehyde, carboxylic, epoxy, mercapto and maleimide functionality were anchored onto the FSP-made &#947;-Fe2O3 particles. These versatile functional groups led to conjugation of active trypsin. The immobilised trypsin exhibited superior durability with &gt;60% residual activity after one week, and excellent reusability for &gt;5 cycles. The trypsin-conjugated MNPs are promising carriers in proteomics, demonstrating good substrate specificity with equivalent or better sequence coverage compared to free trypsin in insulin and BSA digestion. In another application, a refined silanisation procedure simultaneously reduced &#947;-Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, and generated thiol enriched surface for matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) conjugation. The highly active MMP-2-conjugated MNPs could potentially enhance the interstitial transport of macromolecule/nanoparticles in drug delivery.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flame spray pyrolysis</field><field name="subject">magnetic particles</field><field name="subject">functionalisation</field><field name="subject">particle characterisation</field><field name="subject">iron oxide nanoparticles</field><field name="subject">silica coated magnetic particles</field><field name="subject">bovine serum albumin</field><field name="subject">silane</field><field name="subject">trypsin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying the "safe place, safe person, safe systems" framework to improve OHS management: a new integrated approach</field><field name="creator">Makin, Anne-Marie, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A new model was developed to enhance the understanding of the full context of work associated hazards, to explore the connection between OHS performance and a systematic approach to safety, and to simplify approaches to OHS management. This Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems model was derived from the literature and used as the basis for the development of a framework, consisting of 60 elements which was transformed into an assessment tool. This assessment tool was trialled with a pilot study on a medium sized manufacturing plant in the plastics industry, and the tool and Preliminary Report peer reviewed by an expert panel using the Nominal Group Technique. After refinements were made to the assessment tool it was applied to eight case studies that were drawn from advertisements. This qualitative study consisted of two parts: firstly the assessment using the Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems framework; and secondly a controlled self assessment exercise to target improvements to three of the elements over a period of four months. The study illustrated that the Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems framework could be successfully applied in a range of industries to promote OHS improvements and to provide a systematic, planned approach to fulfilling OHS responsibilities. The application of this framework highlighted that: there is a need for further education on the correct application of the risk assessment process and the responsibilities owed to contractors; techniques such as dynamic risk assessments are more suitable where the place of work is variable and hazards are unpredictable; more focus is needed on the appropriate management of hazardous substances with long term health consequences; and that the level of formality invoked for treating hazards does not necessarily equate to improved risk reduction outcomes. The Safe Place, Safe Person, Safe Systems framework was found to be applicable to small, medium and large organisations provided the assessment was scoped to a small division of relatively homogeneous activity to ensure a more representative hazard profile. This approach has provided a way forward to simplify OHS management and also offers practical direction for implementing a targeted OHS improvement program.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Safe person.</field><field name="subject">OHS management.</field><field name="subject">Safe place.</field><field name="subject">Safe systems.</field><field name="subject">Safe place, safe person, safe systems framework.</field><field name="subject">Dynamic risk assessments.</field><field name="subject">OHS in small to medium enterprises.</field><field name="subject">Barriers to OHS implementation.</field><field name="subject">Risk reduction factor.</field><field name="subject">Simplified OHS management.</field><field name="subject">Safety management.</field><field name="subject">OHS risk management.</field><field name="subject">Multiple case studies.</field><field name="subject">Qualitative approach.</field><field name="subject">OHS management systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43636</field></doc><doc><field name="title">NMR spectroscopic studies of binding and exchange in rhenium alkane complexes</field><field name="creator">Lawes, Douglas John, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The transition metal complexes cyclopentadienylrhenium tricarbonyl [CpRe(CO)3, Cp = cyclopentadienyl] and (isopropylcyclopentadienyl)rhenium tricarbonyl [(i-PrCp)Re(CO)3, i-Pr = isopropyl] were photolysed in alkanes at low temperature and the resulting alkane complexes, of the general formula Cp'Re(CO)2(alkane) (Cp' = Cp or (i-PrCp)), were studied using NMR spectroscopy. Characteristic proton chemical shifts (&#948;) and couplings (3JHH) were observed for alkane complexes of several linear, branched and cyclic alkanes of up to eight carbons. Alkanes with chemically distinct methyl (CH3) and/or methylene (CH2) units were observed alternatively binding through each unit to rhenium. No bound methine unit was observed. Large C-H coupling constants (1JCH) were observed for protons of several bound CH3 and CH2 units, indicating the bound C-H is intact. These species are, thus, alkane sigma (&#963;) complexes, wherein the alkane has an agostic (M-H-C, 3 centre 2 electron) interaction with the rhenium centre.  The CH3 binding mode of (i-PrCp)Re(CO)2(1-pentane) was elucidated; sequential deuteration in the bound CH3 revealed an equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) in the remaining proton/s, confirming that only one C-H has an agostic interaction with rhenium at any instant . NMR parameters &#948;(1H) (-8.22), &#948;(13C) ( 42.4) and 1JCH (85 Hz) for the complexed C-H reveal it is unequivocally intact and yet strongly interacting with the rhenium centre, hallmarks for the agostic interaction.  Intramolecular exchange was identified between pentane complex isomers Cp'Re(CO)2(1-pentane), Cp'Re(CO)2(2-pentane) and Cp'Re(CO)2(3-pentane). Equilibrium constants were determined, revealing a preference for CH2 binding over CH3.  The inequivalent hydrogens found in methylene groups of cyclohexane at low temperature permitted simultaneous observation of axial and equatorial C-H protons of a bound CH2 in CpRe(CO)2(cyclohexane); an EIE, upon deuteration, indicated rapid exchange between complexed C-H bonds in the bound CH2 unit. The rhenium centre was found to prefer complexation of the axial C-H bond, over the equatorial, with K ~2.9.  Intermolecular exchange of alkane ligands with free solvent was directly observed, in the competitive complexation of the [CpRe(CO)2] fragment to different alkanes in binary mixtures. The preference cyclohexane &gt; cyclopentane &gt; pentane &gt; isobutane was established and equilibrium constants determined. The kinetics were followed by NMR and modelled, revealing rate constants; decay rates were also determined.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">agostic</field><field name="subject">alkane complex</field><field name="subject">sigma complex</field><field name="subject">rhenium</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Forgetting in logic programs</field><field name="creator">Wong, Ka-Shu, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Forgetting is an operation which removes information from a set of logical statements, such that a) the language used by the logic is simplified; and b) as much information as possible from the original logical statements are preserved. Forgetting operations are useful in a variety of contexts, including knowledge representation, where it is necessary to have an operation for removing information from knowledge bases; and the problem of relevance, where logical statements are simplified by removing irrelevant information. In this thesis we consider forgetting operations on logic programs with negation-as-failure according to the stable model semantics.  There are existing notions of forgetting on logic programs in the literature: the strong forgetting and weak forgetting of Zhang and Foo, and the semantic approach to forgetting introduced by Wang et al. However, these notions are inadequate: the strong and weak forgettings are defined syntactically with no obvious connections to semantic notions of forgetting; while the semantic approach of Wang et al. does not take into account ``hidden'' information encoded in unused rules.  The idea of equivalence on logic programs capture the extent of information contained in a logic program. We consider that two logic programs are equivalent iff the two programs contain the same information. For logic programs, there are many different possible notions of equivalence. We look at the well-known notion of strong equivalence and a new notion of equivalence which we call T-equivalence. Associated with each of these equivalences is a consequence relation on logic program rules. We present sound and complete set of inference rules for both consequence relations.  We present a novel approach to logic program forgetting which uses as its basis a set of postulates, which are defined relative to a notion of equivalence. We show that if we use T-equivalence as the equivalence relation, then the only possible forgetting operations (up to equivalence) are strong forgetting and weak forgetting. If strong equivalence is used instead, then there are also only two possible forgetting operations (up to equivalence).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Belief revision.</field><field name="subject">Logic programming.</field><field name="subject">Forgetting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Polymer segmented cladding fibres: cross fibre modelling, design, fabrication and experiment</field><field name="creator">Yeung, Anson Chi-Ming, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the first research on polymer-segmented-cladding-fibre (PSCF), an emerging class of microstructured- optical-fibres (MOFs), which allows single-mode operation with ultra-large-core area. This research covers the modelling, design, fabrication and experiment of the polymer optical cross-fibre (4-period-SCF) whose cross-sectional view resembles a cross.  A new wedge waveguide model has been formulated and applied to demonstrate that for any given parameters, the cross fibre gives the same performance for single-mode operation as the N-period-SCFs (for N = 2, 6 and 8). These fibres behave identically if the high-index segment angle, &#952;1, is the same and the low-index segment angular width, &#952;2, is sufficiently large for negligible adjacent mode coupling effects. This remarkable finding has significant ramifications for SCF fabrication, design and performance. Theoretical predictions confirmed by experiments demonstrated that a cross-fibre is all that needed to fabricate a large-core single-mode-fibre with no geometry-induced birefringence.   The high-index outer ring effects on the cross fibre single-mode performance have been systematically investigated for the first time. The study reveals that the ring index value higher than its core index has very strong effects on single-mode performance.  Within a narrow range of &#952;1, the minimum fibre length required for single-mode operation is reduced but outside this angle range, longer single-mode length is required. Furthermore, the fibre can be anti-guiding if &#952;1 exceeds the cutoff angle. Incorporating the fabrication constraints, the optimal cross-fibre design with high-index ring is achieved by optimising the relative index difference, high-index segment angle and core-cladding diameter ratio.  Two preform-making techniques developed for the cross-fibres fabrication include the cladding-segment-in-tube method and the core-cladding-segment-in-tube method. The innovative approach in these methods overcomes the problems of bubble formation and fractures, which are related to the fibre structure complexity and the polymer intrinsic properties and their processing. It enables the successful drawing of single-mode fibres. This thesis reports the first experimental demonstration of single-mode operation of large-core cross-fibre. Three experimental studies with different cross-fibre designs have demonstrated (i) large-core single-mode operation, (ii) high-index ring effects on fibre performance and (iii) cross-fibre optimal design trial. Apart from this, the 8-period-SCF fibre performance has been demonstrated experimentally.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cross fibres</field><field name="subject">Polymer optical fibres</field><field name="subject">Segmented cladding fibres</field><field name="subject">Photonic crystal fibres</field><field name="subject">Single mode fibres</field><field name="subject">Leakage losses</field><field name="subject">Wedge waveguide model</field><field name="subject">Cross fibre design</field><field name="subject">Cross fibre fabrication</field><field name="subject">Polymer segmented cladding fibres</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43656</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design of learning environment for beginning level Japanese education:  classroom as a community</field><field name="creator">Ohara, Tetsushi, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The context of this study lies in the fact that in Australia, compared to learners of Japanese language in Japan, learners tend to have fewer opportunities to use Japanese. For many learners in Australia, especially beginners, it is difficult to find a variety of opportunities and maintain motivation to seek out and participate in such opportunities to use Japanese. In the present study, the researcher exploits sociocultural approaches (SCT) in a beginning-level Japanese language program in an institutional setting in order to enable language learners to become language users in Australia. Based on Lave and Wenger (1999), the study considers that learning a foreign/second language brings about not only the acquisition of linguistic structures but also leads to changes in participation in communities. Adopting SCT, the researcher created Japanese language revision courses at an Australian university and designed participant roles, rules, and artefacts in the revision courses as well as devising activities that aimed to develop the classroom into a community and to enhance the use of Japanese as a means of self-expression for learners. The results of the study show that the learners developed a sense of community in the classroom through a variety of activities in the revision course. One of the new roles introduced for this study, the role of the nicchoku, had a significant effect on making classroom interaction learner-centred and authentic. Under the leadership of the nicchoku, other learners engaged in learning activities, while the teacher stepped aside to take a support role. The nicchoku altered the typical teacher-fronted classroom sequence of Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) and helped redistribute classroom turns more evenly among classroom members. The study suggests that interactions are important not only to learn language but also to build human relationships. Thus, if the course aims to build both language proficiency and a learning community, it is necessary to create a variety of interaction opportunities in the classroom so that learners can acquire interactional competence/social skills to build a good relationship in a target language in/outside of the classroom. The results of the SPOT show a significant improvement in the Japanese proficiency of all the learners in the revision course. In addition, the study described an acquisition process of the verb ??ogoru?? as an example. The learners encountered the expression, learned its linguistic structure, applied it to a variety of contexts to learn its usage, and used it as a means of self-expression. The process showed that using the linguistic structure as a means of self-expression occurred through, first, acquisition of the linguistic structure, second, exposure to appropriate applications including sociolinguistic aspects in a given context and, third, experiences of a variety of interactions though activities. Thus, all stages of classroom activities are necessary to help learners enhance their ability to use Japanese as a means of self-expression. These findings suggest the classroom can provide learners with opportunities to use Japanese as a means of self-expression if the roles and activities in the classroom are carefully designed to bring learners into learner-centred interaction sequences, which are both qualitatively and quantitatively different from the typical teacher-fronted IRF sequences. In addition, the study indicates that learning a foreign language and becoming a language user is a complex and dynamic process of learners participating in communities that are created, maintained, and changed by their members, the acquisition of linguistic structures and appropriate application to context, and individual learners?? personal attributes and experience.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language user</field><field name="subject">Japanese language</field><field name="subject">Sociocultural approach</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43588</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Does meditation have a specific effect?: a systematic experimental evaluation of a mental silence orientated definition</field><field name="creator">Manocha, Ramesh, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Meditation and its underlying ideas are increasingly popular in Western society but the practice itself has been subjected to little high quality scientific scrutiny. In this thesis I describe the outcomes of a research programme aimed at addressing this deficiency. A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of the entire English-speaking database of randomised controlled trials clearly demonstrates that the extant data is characterised by a number of methodological and conceptual flaws. As a result there is currently no consistent evidence of a specific effect associated with meditation. The most fundamentally important of these flaws, I propose, is the lack of a consistent and meaningful definition of meditation. Exploring the original descriptions of the meditative experience reveals that a key feature of meditation is the experience of mental silence. Despite this, Western definitions characterise meditation as a method of relaxation, focusing of attention or cognitive modification. The poor performance of meditation in scientific studies may be explained by the fact that definitions of meditation used by Western scientists do not appear to reflect the understanding of meditation as described in the Eastern traditions from which it originated. To explore the salience of the mental silence concept I first conducted a survey of 348 meditators who used a single homogenous form of meditation called Sahaja Yoga which focuses on the experience of mental silence as its defining feature, to assess their functional health and its relationship with their meditative practices. This survey demonstrated that these meditators had not only better mental and physical health but also that a consistent relationship between health, especially mental health, and selfreported experience of mental silence existed. To investigate the possibility of whether or not this relationship was causal, a series of increasingly rigorous clinical studies were implemented. Two separate observational and case control studies of participants suffering from 1) menopausal symptoms, and 2) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrated promising outcomes. These were followed by a small but well-designed RCT of meditation for asthma, then the largest RCT of meditation for occupational stress currently in the literature. The latter two studies were specifically designed to exclude non-specific ??placebo?? effects. The outcomes of these studies provided strong evidence that mental silence is associated with a specific, therapeutic effect. Finally, in a heuristic physiological study mental silence meditators manifested reductions in skin temperature during meditation thereby contradicting the ??reduced physiological arousal?? conceptualisation of meditation. This and other data are discussed and the possibility that the mental silence experience is associated with a unique pattern of physiological activity is proposed. In conclusion, there is credible evidence to support the idea that Sahaja Yoga meditation, and hence the mental silence experience that typifies it, is associated with unique effects. The ramifications for the fields of meditation research, consciousness and religious studies and healthcare are discussed. Future studies are proposed that focus on further examination of the mental silence state and potential mechanisms by which its specific effects may occur with emphasis on immunogenetic markers and neuroimaging.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meditation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of surface hot shortness in low carbon steel</field><field name="creator">O'Neill, Daniel Scott, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A series of model steels containing copper levels up to 0.48wt%, nickel up to 0.22wt% and silicon levels of 0.52wt% were oxidised in air at 1050 and 1150??C, and in a CO2-N2 mixture at 1250??C for times of up to 3 hours. The scaling kinetics were measured and the behaviour of copper-rich phase formation at the scale/metal interface was investigated. When oxidised at 1050/1150??C, significant quantities of copper-rich phase were observed for most model steels. The relatively high oxidation rate under these conditions led to the rapid development of a copper-rich layer with little copper diffusing into the metal. However, when oxidised at 1250??C, the copper-rich phase did not form for a significant amount of time; and for some model steels, not at all. This was attributed to the considerably lower oxidation rate and the fact that more copper was found to have diffused into the metal. Alloying additions of nickel and silicon were found to be beneficial in reducing the amount of copper-rich phase measured at the scale/metal interface under the conditions investigated at 1150??C and 1250??C. This occurred because nickel and silicon addition promoted the occlusion of copper-rich phase into the scale.  Copper enrichment during oxidation was modelled using a numerical description of the diffusion processes involved. Predictions of the time for commencement of copper-rich phase formation at 1250??C were in close agreement with observation. Agreement between predicted and observed copper-rich layer thickness was less successful under conditions where occlusion was significant, and the measured thickness varied non-uniformly with time.  The cracking susceptibility of the model steels was examined using a hot compression test. Oxidation was performed in air at 1050, 1150 and 1250??C and most specimens were compressed at 1050??C. The amount of cracking was found to increase with the amount of copper-rich phase precipitated at the scale/metal interface during oxidation.

There have been demands for citizens to respect each others?? differences, as well as fears about declining social cohesion and acts of intolerance. In political theory, these themes also have currency, although here they often have been obscured by a tendency to think in terms of ??majorities?? and minorities??, and ??we?? and ??they??, rather than in terms of the state and the individual citizen. This thesis argues that while respect of difference may seem to be the best way to successfully accommodate individual difference, it is an indefensible demand on the citizen: such a demand is both excessive and unnecessary, and has the potential to unjustifiably limit individual freedom and the accommodation of difference. Further, the requirement for social cohesion is often overstated, while acts of intolerance are best avoided by citizens respecting each others?? sameness (citizenship) rather than their difference. As far as the state is concerned, by clearly distinguishing specific instances of tolerance (which always involve forbearance) from the general practice of toleration, the thesis defends toleration as a general and maximally permissive practice ?? one which is compatible with both liberal neutrality and the maximal accommodation of individual difference, and thus the freedom of individuals to live their lives as they see fit.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multiculturalism</field><field name="subject">Respect</field><field name="subject">Toleration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Compensatory strategies in humans performing active and passive gaze fixation and re-fixation tasks after unilateral vestibular deafferentation</field><field name="creator">Black, Ross Arthur, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The human vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) stabilizes gaze during head movement. The reflex is typically tested in a clinic or laboratory using passive rotations or artificial stimuli which measure the amount of damage the vestibular apparatus has suffered. However, during everyday activities the vestibular system is stimulated by active, self generated head movements. Head movements are often rapid and associated with the goal of achieving either gaze-fixation or re-fixation. Patients who complain of on-going symptoms will typically identify a particular position or movement that aggravates their symptoms in their everyday life. There is a need to identify objective parameters which correlate with the subjective complaints of patients whose symptoms persist after vestibular damage. In the first study, a gaze-refixation task, patients who complain of ongoing symptoms (poorly-compensated), during rapid head turns, after unilateral vestibular de-afferentation (uVD) were compared with those who did not have the same complaints (well-compensated) and normal subjects. Well- and poorly-compensated groups were sorted according to responses on a standardized questionnaire. All subjects were then located in a real-world, non-laboratory environment in which poorly-compensated subjects reported experiencing symptoms. Each subject&#146;s head, eye and gaze displacement and velocity, head rotation frequency and blink or eye-lid closure were measured and analysed and compared between ipsi- and contra-lesional head rotations within and between subject groups.  When subjects are able to generate their own active head rotations it has been suggested that a number of vestibular and extra-vestibular strategies might be employed to compensate for an impaired VOR. In subsequent studies, high resolution scleral search coils were used to identify the compensatory mechanisms used during active head rotations during a gaze-fixation task. A corrective saccade is typically observed during passive ipsilesional head rotations or &#147;impulses&#148; and might be potentiated during rapid, active or self-generated head rotations. The conditions which predict or contribute to the generation of the rapid, corrective eye movement were investigated. The results were compared with responses to passive head impulses of matched velocity and acceleration to determine if active head impulses could be used to identify a lesioned vestibular apparatus as is routinely clinically achieved with passive head impulses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vestibulo-ocular reflex</field><field name="subject">human</field><field name="subject">vestibular compensation</field><field name="subject">head impulse</field><field name="subject">active passive</field><field name="subject">saccade</field><field name="subject">natural head movement</field><field name="subject">unilateral</field><field name="subject">gaze</field><field name="subject">activity of daily living</field><field name="subject">objective subjective</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modulation of arterial stiffness by angiotensin receptors and nitric oxide in the insulin resistance syndrome</field><field name="creator">Brillante, Divina Graciela, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The insulin resistance syndrome [INSR] is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and affects up to 25% of the Australian population. The mechanism underlying the relationship between the INSR and increased cardiovascular risk is controversial. We postulated that perturbations in the renin-angiotensin system [RAS] and endothelium-derived NO may be implicated in the development of early vascular changes in the INSR.  Repeated measurements of arterial stiffness [using digital photoplethysmography] and haemodynamic parameters in response to vasoactive medications were used to demonstrate the functional expression of angiotensin II [Ang II] receptors and NO synthase [NOS].  Ang II acts via two main receptor sub-types: the Ang II type 1 [AT1] and Ang II type 2 [AT2] receptors. The AT1 receptor is central to the development of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction. The role of AT2 receptors in humans is controversial but is postulated to counter-act AT1 receptor mediated effects in diseased vascular beds. We demonstrated increased AT1 and AT2 receptor-mediated effects in small to medium-sized arteries of subjects with early INSR [Chapter 6].  In addition, functional expression of AT2 receptors in adult insulin resistant humans [Chapter 5], but not in healthy volunteers [Chapter 4] was demonstrated. AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with early INSR resulted in improvements in vascular function, with a consequent functional down-regulation of AT2 receptors [Chapter 7].  Functional NOS expression was demonstrated to be increased in subjects with early INSR compared with healthy controls [Chapter 6]. This was postulated to be a homeostatic response to counteract early vascular changes in subjects with early INSR. AT1 receptor blockade in these subjects reduced functional NOS expression [Chapter 8].  In conclusion, patients with early INSR represent a model of early disease where early intervention may be able to reverse the process incited by the initial exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Early vascular changes in these individuals are mediated at least in part, by increased AT1 receptor activity and/or expression, and may be detected by changes in arterial stiffness indices and non-invasive vascular reactivity studies. There is a compensatory increase in AT2 receptor and NOS expression/activity to counter-act these vascular changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arterial stiffness.</field><field name="subject">Insulin resistance syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Metabolic syndrome.</field><field name="subject">Nitric oxide.</field><field name="subject">Angiotensin receptors.</field><field name="subject">AT1 receptor.</field><field name="subject">AT2 receptor.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nonlinear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete frames under extreme loadings</field><field name="creator">Vali Pour Goudarzi, Hamid Reza, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research focuses on improvements and application of 1D finite elements for nonlinear dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete frames under extreme loadings. The concept of force interpolation is adopted for the element formulation and a solution scheme developed based on a total secant stiffness approach that provides good convergence characteristics. The geometrical nonlinearities including 2nd order P-Delta effects as well as catenary action are considered in the element formulation. It is shown that geometrical nonlinearities may have a significant effect on member (structure) response within extreme loading scenarios.  In the analysis of structures subjected to extreme loadings, accurately modelling of the post peak response is vital and, in this respect, the objectivity of the solution with softening must be maintained. The softening of concrete under compression is taken into account, and the objectivity preserved, by adopting a nonlocal damage model for the compressive concrete. The capability of nonlocal flexibility-based formulation for capturing the post-peak response of reinforced concrete beam-columns is demonstrated by numerical examples.  The 1D frame element model is extended for the modelling of 3D framed structures using a simplified torque-twist model that is developed to take account of interaction between normal and tangential forces at the section level. This simplified model can capture the variation of element torsional stiffness due to presence of axial force, bending moment and shear and is efficient and is shown to provide a reasonable degree of accuracy for the analysis of 3D reinforced concrete frames.  The formulations and solution algorithms developed are tested for static and dynamic analysis of reinforced concrete framed structures with examples on impact analysis of beams, dynamic analysis of frames and progressive collapse assessment of frames taken from the literature. The verification shows that the formulation is very efficient and is capable of modelling of large scale framed structures, under extreme loads, quickly and with accuracy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Progressive collapse.</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear finite element.</field><field name="subject">Dynamic analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43720</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Breath biomarkers associated with lung cancer</field><field name="creator">Tran , Vanessa Hoang, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Lung cancer (LC) is often diagnosed at advanced stage and as a result, survival rates are low. Recent studies describe exhaled breath and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) as a potential non-invasive method of sampling the airways for assessing inflammation of the respiratory system, and possibly for the early detection of LC. It was hypothesised that higher concentrations of markers and protein will be present in the EBC of LC patients compared to those of normal controls and healthy smokers, and may aid in assessing lung status.  Methods: The gaseous phase of breath was investigated for volatile organic compound (VOC) patterns using an electronic nose (eNose) system, in addition to off-line measurements of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO) levels. The aqueous phase, EBC, was collected during tidal breathing through a glass collection device cooled to 4??C by ice. Nitrite/nitrate (NOx) and pH levels were determined by a fluorescent modification of the Griess method, and silicon chip sensor pH meter, respectively. Protein levels in EBC were examined with a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, silver staining and PAGE techniques, while the levels of tumour markers, CYFRA 21-1 and CEA, were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).  Results: The eNose machine was not able to produce characteristic VOC profiles from exhaled breath unique to each study group, while no significant difference was observed for mean NOx concentrations in the LC group when compared to other subjects (p=0.8824). Higher protein levels were found in the EBC of LC patient compared to normal controls (p=0.0204), with subsequent measurements of elevated CEA levels observed in the LC group when compared to non-smokers and smokers (p=0.023).  Conclusion: This study showed that protein can be detected in the exhaled breath condensate of patients, with a significantly elevated amount in the samples from newly diagnosed LC patients. The mechanism for these differences remains to be determined but may be related to inflammatory changes within the airway, such as vascular protein leakage and release of mediators. Future work may aim to identify the upregulated proteins, and focus on proteomics and tissue microarrays to explore candidate proteins.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electronic nose.</field><field name="subject">Lung cancer.</field><field name="subject">Exhaled breath condensate</field><field name="subject">Protein.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising the uncertainty in potential large rapid changes in wind power generation</field><field name="creator">Cutler, Nicholas Jeffrey, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wind energy forecasting can facilitate wind energy integration into a power system. In particular, the management of power system security would benefit from forecast information on plausible large, rapid change in wind power generation. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems are presently the best available tools for wind energy forecasting for projection times between 3 and 48 hours. In this thesis, the types of weather phenomena that cause large, rapid changes in wind power in southeast Australia are classified using observations from three wind farms. The results show that the majority of events are due to horizontal propagation of spatial weather features. A study of NWP systems reveals that they are generally good at forecasting the broad large-scale weather phenomena but may misplace their location relative to the physical world. Errors may result from developing single time-series forecasts from a single NWP grid point, or from a single interpolation of proximate grid points. This thesis presents a new approach that displays NWP wind forecast information from a field of multiple grid points around the wind farm location. Displaying the NWP wind speeds at the multiple grid points directly would potentially be misleading as they each reflect the estimated local surface roughness and terrain at a particular grid point. Thus, a methodology was developed to convert the NWP wind speeds at the multiple grid points to values that reflect surface conditions at the wind farm site. The conversion method is evaluated with encouraging results by visual inspection and by comparing with an NWP ensemble. The multiple grid point information can also be used to improve downscaling results by filtering out data where there is a large chance of a discrepancy between an NWP time-series forecast and observations. The converted wind speeds at multiple grid points can be downscaled to site-equivalent wind speeds and transformed to wind farm power assuming unconstrained wind farm operation at one or more wind farm sites. This provides a visual decision support tool that can help a forecast user assess the possibility of large, rapid changes in wind power from one or more wind farms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Numerical weather prediction</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Wind power forecasting</field><field name="subject">Numerical weather prediction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast</field><field name="creator">Raponi, Mitch, Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Genetics, UNSW</field><field name="description">The major aims of this thesis were to investigate the influence of i) antisense gene location relative to the target gene locus (?????location effect?????), ii) double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation, and iii) over-expression of host-encoded proteins on antisense RNA-mediated gene regulation. To test the location effect hypothesis, strains were generated which contained the target lacZ gene at a fixed location and the antisense lacZ gene at various genomic locations including all arms of the three fission yeast chomosomes and in close proximity to the target gene locus. A long inverse-PCR protocol was developed to rapidly identify the precise site of antisense gene integration in the fission yeast transformants. No significant difference in lacZ suppression was observed when the antisense gene was integrated in close proximity to the target gene locus, compared with other genomic locations, indicating that target and antisense gene co-localisation is not a critical factor for efficient antisense RNA-mediated gene suppression in vivo. Instead, increased lacZ down-regulation correlated with an increase in the steady-state level of antisense RNA, which was dependent on genomic position effects and transgene copy number. In contrast, convergent transcription of an overlapping antisense lacZ gene was found to be very effective at inhibiting lacZ gene expression. DsRNA was also found to be a central component of antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing in fission yeast. It was shown that gene suppression could be enhanced by increasing the intracellular concentration of non-coding lacZ RNA, while expression of a lacZ panhandle RNA also inhibited beta-galactosidase activity. In addition, over-expression of the ATP-dependent RNA-helicase, ded1, was found to specifically enhance antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing. Through a unique overexpression screen, four novel factors were identified which specifically enhanced antisense RNA-mediated gene silencing by up to an additional 50%. The products of these antisense enhancing sequences (aes factors), all have natural associations with nucleic acids which is consistent with other proteins which have previously been identified to be involved in posttranscriptional gene silencing.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fission yeast</field><field name="subject">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</field><field name="subject">antisense RNA</field><field name="subject">dsRNA</field><field name="subject">gene silencing</field><field name="subject">lacZ</field><field name="subject">antisense enhancing sequence</field><field name="subject">Plant gene silencing</field><field name="subject">Yeast fungi</field><field name="subject">Antisense nucleic acids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18277</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene profiling in soft tissue sarcoma: predictive value of EGFR in sarcoma tumour progression and survival</field><field name="creator">Das Gupta, Paromita, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite improvements in the clinical management of soft tissue sarcomas (STS), 50% of patients will die of metastatic disease that is largely unresponsive to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. The aims of this study were to identify genes and pathways that are dysregulated in progressive and metastatic STS. In addition to this, cell lines from fresh tumours were initiated and established, thus increasing the repository of cell lines available for functional studies. Recent advances in the understanding of the molecular biology of STS have thus far not resulted in the use of molecular markers for clinical prognostication. Identifying novel genes and pathways will lead to molecular diagnostic methods to better stratify prognostic groups and could identify cellular targets for more efficacious treatments. Gene expression profiling of sarcoma cell lines of increasing metastatic potential revealed over-expression of genes involved in the epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) pathways. Factors involved in invasion and metastasis such as integrins and MMPs were over-expressed in the cell lines with higher metastatic potential. The developmental Notch pathway and cell cycle regulators were also dysregulated. NDRG1 was significantly over-expressed in the high grade sarcoma cell line, a novel finding in sarcomas. The expression of EGFR, NDRG1 and other genes from the above pathways was validated using quantitative RT-PCR in real time (qRT-PCR). A tissue microarray (TMA) comprising STS of varying tumour grades was constructed for high throughput assessment of target proteins. EGFR, its activated form and its signal transducers were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Activated EGFR (HR 2.228, p &lt; 0.001) and phosphorylated Akt (HR 2.032, p = 0.003) were found to be independent predictors of overall survival and both correlated with tumour grade. Of the several STS cultures initiated and maintained, two of these cell lines were fully characterised in terms of cytogenetics, telomerase and alternate lengthening of 5 telomeres (ALT) status, KIT and TP53 mutation and the expression of certain biomarkers using both qRT-PCR and IHC. In summary, transcript profiling identified several potential biomarkers of tumour progression and metastasis in STS. Crucially, activated EGFR and pAkt were found in a cohort of STS samples to correlate with clinical outcome, identifying them as potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in the treatment of STS. Activated EGFR can be used as a diagnostic marker for patient selection, as well as for target effect monitoring. Furthermore, the cell lines established in this project will serve as valuable tools in future preclinical studies.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Activated EGFR</field><field name="subject">soft tissue sarcoma</field><field name="subject">EGFR</field><field name="subject">gene expression profiling</field><field name="subject">tissue microarray</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43259</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Should the rule in Houldsworth??s case be abrogated by statute?</field><field name="creator">Di Lernia, Cary Anthony, Business Law &amp; Taxation, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">At the crossroads of insolvency and securities law lies the question as to whether defrauded shareholders should rank equally with unsecured creditors in cases involving fraudulent or misleading behaviour. Important questions arise at this juncture concerning the efficiency, certainty, transparency and fairness of the treatment of such claims in insolvency situations. In Sons of Gwalia Ltd (admin apptd) v Margaretic [2007] HCA 1, the High Court chose not to apply a rule said to be germane to insolvency cases involving fraudulent or misleading conduct inducing share purchase known as the rule in Houldsworth??s Case. The ??rule?? said to have been developed in Houldsworth v City of Glasgow Bank (1880) 5 App Cas 317 had up until the High Court??s decision been used to interpret legislative provisions concerning shareholder claims, resulting in problematic determinations in the context of modern developed markets.  While it is submitted the High Court was justified in choosing not to apply the rule in Houldsworth??s Case and thus allowing shareholders to claim as unsecured creditors, the rule may still prove good law in certain cases. Indeed, the referral of the High Court??s decision to the Corporations and Markets Advisory Committee for review may result in legislative change which reverts to the traditional treatment of shareholders in such circumstances. Accordingly this dissertation engages in a doctrinal analysis of historical precedent on defrauded shareholder claims in the UK and Australia to demonstrate that the decision in Houldsworth and subsequent interpretation and application of the ??rule?? therein suffer from deep flaws, and have been productive of relative injustice. It is argued that it is necessary to put the current uncertainty surrounding the applicability of Houldsworth in Australia beyond doubt through legislative abrogation of the rule in Houldsworth??s Case. As the result of such abrogation would represent a significant policy shift in Australian corporate law, the merits and difficulties of the resulting position will be addressed by this dissertation. It will be argued that a policy of shareholder parity with unsecured creditors best meets the goals of insolvency and securities law regimes while contributing to the sustainability of a fair and efficient market, and investor participation in it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aggrieved shareholder rights</field><field name="subject">Houldsworth's case</field><field name="subject">Sons of Gwalia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the atypical dual specificity phosphatase DUSP26</field><field name="creator">Patterson, Kate Isabel, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In many ways cancer is a disease of cellular signalling disequilibrium. When the equilibrium of key signalling pathways is upset, critical biological functions such as cell growth, survival, motility, proliferation, metabolism and apoptosis are affected, and can lead to the initiation of cancer. Reversible protein phosphorylation is an extremely important mechanism by which the activity of enzymes and proteins in signalling cascades can be regulated. Dual specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) are a unique subgroup of the protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in that they can dephosphorylate both phospho-tyrosine and phospho-serine/threonine residues within the one substrate.  Many DUSPs have been implicated in cancer as critical regulators of key cancer- associated signalling cascades including the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.  Transcript profiling of 51 primary ovarian tumours and four normal ovaries as controls identified an uncharacterised atypical DUSP, DUSP26 as being potentially down-regulated in all histological subtypes of ovarian cancer compared with normal ovaries. DUSP26 is located at 8p12, a chromosomal region previously shown to exhibit allelic imbalance in ovarian cancer. DUSP26 is predominantly expressed in neuro-endocrine tissue, with high expression also in skeletal muscle, prostate and ovary. DUSP26 mRNA expression is reduced in brain cancer, neuroblastoma, and ovarian cancer cell lines compared to normal, consistent with a role for DUSP26 as a tumour suppressor gene. Furthermore, DUSP26 can negatively affect the proliferation of epithelial cells, also consistent with a role as a tumour suppressor gene.  Expression of DUSP26 in primary ovarian cancer samples is variable however, and analysis of DUSP26 protein expression is required to reconcile these results. Preliminary results suggest that DUSP26 is epigenetically regulated and that hypermethylation may contribute to its silencing in cancer. In the literature, there is great controversy in regards to the substrate specificity of DUSP26. Results presented in this thesis conclusively demonstrate that DUSP26 is not a MAPK phosphatase, despite reports to the contrary. Instead, using a substrate trapping approach, two novel potential DUSP26 substrates were identified: DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA), which are often dysregulated in cancer. Consequently, DUSP26 may affect the pathogenesis of cancer via DNA-PK and or NuMA.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">DUSP</field><field name="subject">Phosphatase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trends and development of non-communicable diseases and risk factors in Samoa over 24 years</field><field name="creator">Viali, Satupaitea, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract inserted as part of Final MPH Thesis:  Non-Communicable Diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and others, have become the major cause of premature death, morbidity and disability in many Pacific countries including Samoa. These are linked by common preventable risk factors like obesity, hypertension, smoking, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity. OBJECTIVES: To determine the trends and development of Non-Communicable diseases and its risk factors in Samoa over the last 24 years using the recently developed diagnostic criteria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This research thesis combines 3 large surveys that were done in 1978, 1991, and 2002, looking at the trends in the prevalence of diabetes, and the prevalence of the NCD risk factors such as blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol and smoking. The 3 survey samples were selected randomly from around similar regions (Urban Upolu, Rural Upolu, and Rural Savaii) of Samoa in 1978, 1991 and 2002, with a total of 5973 individuals (1978 survey = 1467; 1991 survey = 1778; 2002 survey = 2728) available for the thesis analysis. The 1978 and 1991 data sets were secured from Professor P Zimmet, and the 2002 STEPs survey data set was secured from the Samoa Ministry of Health. The 3 surveys methodologies, survey procedures, questionnaires and anthropometric measurements were similar though the diagnostic criteria used to measure obesity slightly differ between the surveys. The blood pressure measurements were similar though the diastolic blood pressure measure in 1978 was higher. The 1978 and 1991 surveys used fasting venous blood sampling to measure fasting plasma glucose, and cholesterol levels at the laboratory. OGTT was also used in 1978 and 1991, but not 2002. The 2002 survey used capillary sampling to measure fasting glucose using a glucometer, and cholesterol level using a cholesterol meter. The combined data was then cleaned, standardized and matched with each survey, to make analysis easier. The recent diagnostic criteria were then applied to all the surveys to diagnose diabetes (1999 WHO Diabetes Criteria), hypertension (WHO 1999, JNC-VII 2003, NHF 1999 Hypertension Criteria), obesity (BMI &#8805;30 kg/m??), and hypercholesterolaemia. The prevalences using the recent diagnostic criteria were then mapped out.  RESULTS: The overall age-standardized prevalence of type 2 diabetes (known or previously unknown) utilizing the current 1999 WHO diagnostic criteria for men and women &#8805;20 years of age has increased from 5.4% (males 4.8%, females 5.9%) in 1978, to 12.0% (males 10.9%, females 13.5%) in 1991, and to 20.1% (males 17.2%, females 22.2%) in 2002. Among the individuals with diabetes in the 3 surveys, more than 60% had previously undiagnosed diabetes. Compared with the 1978 survey, the diabetes prevalence in 2002 represents a 4-fold increase over the 24 year period. This has occurred along with increasing obesity, urbanization and modernization, aging, cultural changes, and changes in physical activity. There is a high prevalence of non-communicable disease risk factors. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension defined by the WHO 1999 and JNC-VII 2003 criteria was 47.2% in 1978, 22.5% in 1991, and 24.0% in 2002. The high prevalence of hypertension in 1978 was due to the method used for recording diastolic blood pressure. Hypertension was more common in the urban regions than rural regions in 1978 and 1991 while in 2002, there was no statistical difference between the rates of hypertension between the different regions due to the rise in the prevalence rate of hypertension in rural regions.   There is a high prevalence of overweight and obesity in Samoa. Using the WHO classification for BMI, there was an increase in obesity (BMI &#8805; 30kg/m??) prevalence in Samoa in the last decade, increasing steeply from 34.9% in 1978 to 51.3% in 1991, and slowing down to an increase to 57.4% in 2002. The prevalence of obesity is significantly higher in females compared with their male counterparts. The overweight prevalence (BMI 25-29.9kg/m??) was 34% in 1978, 31% in 1991 and 29% in 2002. The prevalence of obesity has increased by 65% from 1978 to 2002 with an increase of 47% from 1978 to 1991, and 12% from 1991 to 2002. Prevalence of obesity is increasing with age and is more of a problem in women than men. It is higher in the urban regions but there has been a faster rise in obesity prevalence in rural regions from 1978 to 2002 as the rural regions become urbanized. The prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol &#8805; 5.2 mmol/l) was 30.5% in 1978, and this increased to 51.1% in 1991. There was a marked decline of hypercholesterolaemia in 2002 (14.4%), which may be due to differences in the method of measurement. Although smoking prevalence remains high in Samoa it declined significantly from 42.4% 1978 to 35.3% 1991 but remained essentially steady at 38% in 2002. There was a significant gender difference in smoking with about 60% of men and 20% of women smoking regularly. CONCLUSION: Samoa is experiencing an increasing problem with Non-Communicable diseases like diabetes and some of its risk factors.  Diabetes prevalence has dramatically increased by 4-fold in the last 24 years. The prevalence of hypertension has stabilized around 23% though there was a decrease from 1978. The prevalence of obesity has also increased. Smoking prevalence has slightly increased from 1991 to 2002 with a significant number of the population smoking. Hypercholesterolaemia is more common in 1991 with an apparent decrease in 2002. These findings have important implications for public health efforts and policy developments to contain the epidemic of Non-Communicable diseases in Samoa.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Obesity</field><field name="subject">Non-Communicable Diseases</field><field name="subject">Diabetes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of quivers over finite fields</field><field name="creator">Hua, Jiuzhao , Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main purpose of this thesis is to obtain surprising identities by counting the representations of quivers over finite fields. A classical result states that the dimension vectors of the absolutely indecomposable representations of a quiver ?? are in one-to-one correspondence with the positive roots of a root system ??, which is infinite in general. For a given dimension vector ?? ??? ??+, the number A??(??, q), which counts the isomorphism classes of the absolutely indecomposable representations of ?? of dimension ?? over the finite field Fq, turns out to be a polynomial in q with integer coefficients, which have been conjectured to be nonnegative by Kac. The main result of this thesis is a multi-variable formal identity which expresses an infinite series as a formal product indexed by ??+ which has the coefficients of various polynomials A??(??, q) as exponents. This identity turns out to be a qanalogue of the remarkable Weyl-Macdonald-Kac denominator identity modulus a conjecture of Kac, which asserts that the multiplicity of ?? is equal to the constant term of A??(??, q). An equivalent form of this conjecture is established and a partial solution is obtained. A new proof of the integrality of A??(??, q) is given. Three Maple programs have been included which enable one to calculate the polynomials A??(??, q) for quivers with at most three nodes. All sample out-prints are consistence with Kac???s conjectures. Another result of this thesis is as follows. Let A be a finite dimensional algebra over a perfect field K, M be a finitely generated indecomposable module over A ???K ??K. Then there exists a unique indecomposable module M??? over A such that M is a direct summand of M??? ???K ??K, and there exists a positive integer s such that Ms = M ??? ?? ?? ?? ??? M (s copies) has a unique minimal field of definition which is isomorphic to the centre of End ??(M???) rad (End ??(M???)). If K is a finite field, then s can be taken to be 1.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Finite groups</field><field name="subject">Algebras, Linear</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analyzing oppositions in the concept of visuality between aesthetics and visual culture in art and education using John R. Searle's realist account of consciousness</field><field name="creator">Francini, Althea, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">In art and education, theorists dispute the concept of visuality, or how meaning occurs from what we see. This study examines two opposed and acrimoniously entrenched theoretical perspectives adopted internationally: visual culture and aesthetics. In visual culture, visual experience, including perception is mediated by background cultural discourses. On this approach, subjectivity is explained as conventional, the role of the senses in making meaning is strongly diminished or rejected and from this, accounting for visuality precludes indeterminate and intuitive aspects. Differently, aesthetic perspectives approach visual meaning as obtaining through direct perceptual and felt aspects of aesthetic experience. Here, subjectivity remains discrete from language and the role of cultural discourse in making meaning diminishes or is excluded. Each description is important to the explanation of visuality in art and education, but problematic.  To start, the study outlines the central explanatory commitments of both visual culture and aesthetics. The study identifies problems in each with their explanations of subjectivity or self. Both positions maintain from earlier explanations of cognition that separate theoretically and practically the senses, cognitive processes, and context. The study looks at approaches to mind and representation in accounts of visuality and provides some background from the cognitive sciences to understand the problem further. Contemporary explanation from science and philosophy is revising the separation. However, some approaches from science are reductive of mind and both aesthetics and visual culture theorists are understandably reluctant to adopt scientistic or behaviourist approaches for the explanation of visual arts practices.  The aim of the study is to provide a non-reductive realist account of visuality in visual arts and education. To accomplish this aim, the study employs philosopher John R. Searle's explanation of consciousness because it explores subjectivity as qualitative, unified, and intrinsically social in experience. By doing this, the study addresses a gap in the theoretical understanding of the two dominant approaches to visuality. The key to relations between subjectivity and the world in reasoning is the capacity for mental representation. From this capacity and the rational agency of a self, practical reasoning is central to the creation, understanding, and appreciation of art and imagery. This account of consciousness, its aspects, and how it works includes description of the Background, as capacities enabling the uptake and structuring of sociocultural influence in mind. Crucially, the study shows how the capacity for reasoned action can be represented without dualism or reduction to the explanatory constraints of behavioural or physical sciences, an important commitment in the arts and education.  In this explanation, the study identifies epistemic constraints on the representation of mental states, including unconscious states, in accounting for practices as reasoned activities. Centrally, the study looks at how, from the capacities of consciousness and the self's freedom of will, visuality is unified as qualitative, cognitive, and social. In exploring Searle's explanation of consciousness, some account of current work on cognition extends discussion of a reconciliation of visuality on these terms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Visual culture</field><field name="subject">Subjectivity</field><field name="subject">Representation</field><field name="subject">Consciousness</field><field name="subject">Social mind</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43669</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pathology of the camera: tracing the path from collaboration to cooperation between camera and performer</field><field name="creator">Beaubois, Denis, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper investigates a series of video pieces that explore the pathology of the camera and the act of recording.

These cycles have been observed to respond to phase shifts in the El Ni??o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To investigate wave and climate controls of embayment variability in finer detail, this study combines historical surveys with 45 years of wave data from the ERA-40 reanalysis and four years of high-resolution beach measurements using RTK-GPS and image-derived survey techniques. ENSO and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) controls of wave variability in the Sydney region are first explored. In general, wave heights increase/decrease and wave directions become more easterly/southerly during La Ni??a/El Ni??o phases. A positive correlation is observed between the SAM and summer wave heights, and a negative correlation between the SAM and winter wave directions. Storm variability is observed to be modified by the ENSO, but not the SAM. In particular, La Ni??a phases are generally associated with longer duration, higher energy events from a more easterly direction when compared to those during El Ni??o phases.  Wave controls of embayment variability are subsequently investigated. In the short-term (days - months), beach oscillation/rotation is observed to be the most dominant process, accounting for approx. 60%/20% of overall embayment variability. Beach oscillation is related to changes in wave height and storms, whereas beach rotation is related to changes in wave direction and/or wave period. An empirical model that estimates the beach response to individual storm events is developed. In the longer-term (months - years), beach rotation is observed to respond to both wave heights and directions. Larger waves are sheltered somewhat at the southern end, creating an apparent clockwise rotation under energetic wave conditions. Clockwise/anticlockwise rotations are also observed to follow southerly/easterly wave shifts at lags of up to 12 months. Comparisons between the ENSO and beach oscillation/rotation agree with previous observations that El Ni??o/La Ni??a phases are associated with an overall accretion/erosion and clockwise/anticlockwise rotation of the embayment. In general, the SAM shows little influence on embayment variability. While it is clear that beach oscillation is driven by cross-shore processes, to what extent beach rotation is a longshore and/or cross-shore phenomena requires further investigation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wave climate</field><field name="subject">Embayed beaches</field><field name="subject">Coastal imaging</field><field name="subject">ENSO</field><field name="subject">Southern annular mode</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applications of advanced oxidation processes for the treatment of natural organic matter</field><field name="creator">Sanly, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Natural organic matter (NOM) occurs ubiquitously in drinking water supplies and is problematic since it serves as a precursor to disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation. Stricter DBP regulations will drive utilities to consider advanced treatment processes for DBP control through NOM removal. Herein, the transformation of NOM in homogeneous (UVA/H2O2 and UVA/Fe/H2O2) and heterogeneous (UVA/TiO2) Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) were studied.  Organic matter from three different sources was investigated in this work, specifically a commercial humic acid, and two Australian surface water sources. The transformation of the organic matter as a result of oxidation was investigated through multiple analytical techniques, such as UV-Vis spectroscopy, DOC analysis, high performance size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), resin fractionation, liquid chromatography with organic carbon detection (LC-OCD) and disinfection byproducts formation potential. The multi-analysis approach is required due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of NOM. Each analytical technique provides complementary information on different properties of NOM, leading to a comprehensive understanding on how AOPs transform the chemical and physical properties of NOM.  Both homogeneous and heterogeneous AOPs were found to be effective for NOM removal. However, complete mineralisation was not achieved, even under prolonged irradiation. Large aromatic and hydrophobic organics were degraded into lower molecular weight hydrophilic compounds, which had weak UV absorbance at 254 nm. In the UVA/TiO2 treatment, multi-wavelength HPSEC analysis demonstrated the formation of low molecular weight compounds with strong absorbance at wavelength lower than 230 nm. These residual organic compounds, though recalcitrant, had a low reactivity to chlorine to form THMs, and were identified to be low molecular weight acids and neutral compounds from LC-OCD analysis. Finally, the current work reports the novel synthesis of magnetic photocatalyst for NOM oxidation from low cost precursors to solve the separation problem of nano-sized particles. Magnetite particles were coated with a layer of protective silica from sodium silicate precursor. Photoactive titanium dioxide was then deposited onto the silica coated particles using titanium tetrachloride precursor. The as-prepared magnetic photocatalyst exhibited excellent stability and durability. Although the photoactivity of the magnetic photocatalyst is lower than commercial TiO2 photocatalyst, it can be easily recovered by magnetic field.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Natural organic matter</field><field name="subject">Advanced oxidation processes</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43624</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tax-loss selling and managerial discretion</field><field name="creator">Sherry, Samuel, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between tax-loss selling (TLS), where investors with taxable gains sell stocks that have declined in value just before the fiscal year-end to generate offsetting tax losses, and managers?? incentives to influence stock prices, either through increased disclosure or by engaging in upwards earnings management. Firms whose stock prices represent greater potential tax losses in investors?? portfolios at year-end are predicted to increase their disclosure level in June to prevent further share price falls due to TLS, and have higher levels of accruals. Using the number of discretionary, market-sensitive news releases in the Signal G announcement database to measure disclosure frequency, this thesis finds that, for a sample of 14,713 firm-year observations drawn from all ASX firms for the years 1994 to 2007, stocks with larger negative returns have higher disclosure in June, after controlling for size, performance, risk and external financing dependence. This is particularly true of small mining and exploration companies that are more reliant on voluntary disclosure as a vehicle for lowering information asymmetry. This increased disclosure does not appear to contribute to the higher July returns earned by stocks that experienced significant TLS in June. Disclosure frequency is negatively associated with the magnitude of operating and total accruals, suggesting that earnings management is less likely for firms with higher disclosure. There is also evidence that smaller firms with poor stock price performance have higher levels of operating accruals and thus may be more likely to engage in earnings management.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">earnings management</field><field name="subject">tax loss selling</field><field name="subject">discretionary disclosure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43727</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching novices to debug</field><field name="creator">White, Andrew, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis considers how to teach novices to debug computer programs. The investigation is specifically aimed at students in first year of computer science at university. The goal is to find an effective method of improving the debugging ability of novice subjects.  Novices are less effective than experts. Although weaker across the board, novices display a critical lack of strategic skills in the debugging domain. Novices become lost and discouraged easily. Novices do not make good use of program structure, do not use test cases intelligently, and do not track their progress. Even a slight improvement in these aspects has the potential to significantly improve performance.  Expert debugging behaviour was examined. This provided the basis for a model of debugging to be used in instructing novices. Teaching materials were developed to instruct and support students in following the model. The model and training were then tested in both laboratory and classroom situations.  Results were mixed, with a generally positive trend. The model by itself was not overly effective. When the model was accompanied by training materials containing examples and scaffolding, students who were willing to spend time examining the training usually showed some improvement. In a few cases, the student's debugging style was dramatically improved. The improved performance seems to come partially from improved skill and partially from motivation.  The model and materials show potential, and are likely to be more effective when used in an environment that allows interaction, rather than the current paper-based, non-interactive tutorial.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Programming.</field><field name="subject">Debug.</field><field name="subject">Education.</field><field name="subject">Expert.</field><field name="subject">Novice.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43723</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implicit coupled constitutive relations and an energy-based method for material modelling</field><field name="creator">Man, Hou Michael, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The contributions of this thesis are an implicit modelling method for the coupled constitutive relations and an energy-based method for material modelling. The two developed methods utilise implicit models to represent material constitutive relations without the requirement of physical parameters. The first method is developed to model coupled constitutive relations using state-space representation with neural networks. State-space representation is employed to express the desired relations in a compact fashion while simultaneously providing the capability of modelling rate- and/or path-dependent behaviour.  The employment of neural networks with the generalised state-space representation results in a single implicit model that can be adapted for a broad range of constitutive behaviours. The performance and applicability of the method are highlighted through the applications for various constitutive behaviour of piezoelectric materials, including the effects of hysteresis and cyclic degradation.  An energy-based method is subsequently developed for implicit constitutive modelling by utilising the energy principle on a deformed continuum. Two formulations of the proposed method are developed for the modelling of materials with varying nature in directional properties. The first formulation is based on an implicit strain energy density function, represented by a neural network with strain invariants as input, to derive the desired stress-strain relations. The second formulation consists of the derivation of an energy-based performance function for training a neural network that represents the stress-strain relations. The requirement of deriving stress is eliminated in both formulations and this facilitates the use of advanced experimental setup, such as multi-axial load tests or non-standard specimens, to produce the most information for constitutive modelling from a single experiment. A series of numerical studies -- including validation problems and practical cases with actual experimental setup -- have been conducted, the results of which demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method for constitutive modelling on a continuum basis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Composite characterisation.</field><field name="subject">Material constitutive models.</field><field name="subject">Piezoelectric materials.</field><field name="subject">Artificial neural networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43652</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modular decentralized control and design of a reconfigurable redundant manipulator</field><field name="creator">Vittor, Timothy R., Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Soft automation employs multi-functional robotic manipulators where dexterity, versatility and reconfigurability are now becoming key issues. For manipulators used in these circumstances, hyper-redundancy in configuration is essential. A typical application envisaged, is manipulator movement in unpredictable surroundings such as navigation amongst branches and foliage in automated fruit picking. This requires motion of a manipulator in an unmapped dynamic environment to find its way to the goal i.e. the fruit. To date, centralized control architectures have proven impractical for the control of redundant systems because the full environment needs to be mapped, there are time constraints on the computation required and, simultaneously, algorithms for obstacle avoidance must be enacted.  Decentralized control of manipulators complements modular construction because the need for a full environment reconstruction in one master controller is bypassed by having localized sub-goals for each module. Time constraints are removed because the control algorithms are much simpler. Obstacle avoidance is localized. Manipulators constructed modularly are effective because they allow for reconfiguration and ease of fault diagnosis. For modular manipulators to be a more effective option as a subclass of robots, the conditions under which the interactive movements of modules are stable become a major issue.  When a general review of hyper-redundant manipulators was undertaken, no published implementation of Modular Decentralized Control (MDC) was discovered. This thesis explored the use of a modular decentralized technique to create stable control of a redundant manipulator system. The computational burden was minimized by restricting inverse kinematics to within each module. Advantages of the approach taken were the ease of implementation of obstacle avoidance, reconfigurability and fault tolerance. Having firstly simulated a MATLAB version of stable motion using MDC on a modular manipulator with up to six identical modules, the technique was extended with state space analysis to redefine the limits of stable control of a hyper-redundant manipulator. The MDC study mapped motion profile types that were dependant on the initial manipulator configuration and goal position and, thereby, investigated possible instabilities in the system. A two-link, single degree of freedom system was initially explicated followed by an extension of the stability analysis to an n-module two degree of freedom system. A stability theory utilizing decentralized control was formed. Simulation results showed dynamic motion, path generation and obstacle avoidance capabilities in unmapped environments to be stable.  The modeling redefined the bounds of stable control, showing that classical stability via Root Locus, now required only two roots from the characteristic equation to be stable for a selection of path trajectory to the goal to be found. The remaining roots could be unstable in traversing to the goal and settling at a marginal stability point when the goal was reached. The marginal stability was a reflection of the pseudo-independence given to each module in seeking the goal and differed radically from a standard Root Locus analysis and interpretation of stability.  A hyper-redundant Reconfigurable Modular Manipulator System (RMMS) was designed and built to implement the MDC technique in a real world environment. From an initial design, five modules were constructed and control algorithms embedded appropriate to their position in a five-segment robotic manipulator. A stereoscopic vision system was attached to the end of the manipulator which supplied real time data on a goal in 3D Cartesian space. The data was supplied to the first module of the arm and subsequently to all others by localized homogenous transformation. The manipulator was tested for goal seeking, path following, obstacle avoidance, fault tolerance and reconfigurability. The arm produced stable motion and satisfied the criteria as hypothesized in the theory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Manipulators (Mechanism) -- Design and construction.</field><field name="subject">Robotics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Khoesan cranial variation :a study of the Matjes river rock shelter crania</field><field name="creator">Neuweger, Diana Loraine, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Matjes River Rock Shelter, in the Plettenberg Bay region of South Africa, has a large collection of archaeological cranial remains representing 8,000 years of occupation. Forty-three adult crania from the Matjes River collection are studied here, many which have not previously been published. These crania are compared through multivariate analysis with other dated crania from Fish Hoek, Cape Flats, Elands Bay, Port Elizabeth and Kenkelbosch, and with archaeological crania from five ecological biomes, Forest, Fynbos, Nama Karoo, Savanna, and Succulent Karoo biomes in southern Africa. Historical southern African populations, KhoeSan (31) and South African Negroid (120) crania, are also used to compare the affinities of the Ma~es River individuals. The sample sizes within this study are small and an attempt has been made to address this issue by the use of multiple analytical methods and multiple 'tests' of variable sets to improve the statistical significance of results.  This study, incorporating the largest collection of Matjes River individuals, uses principal components analysis to show the individuals to be a single biological population and illustrates with Euclidean distance statistic strong morphological similarities between the individuals. From principal component analysis, and discriminant function analysis there is no determination of morphological differences between the crania on the basis of geographical or environmental differentiation. Overall the KhoeSan crania in this study show homogeneity in form. Holocene gracilisation is seen in the dated crania through principal components analysis. The temporal changes found also indicate a change over time relating to nasal height measurements, while Spearman's rank correlation coefficient found no temporal shape changes occurring between the dated samples. Interestingly, discriminant analysis classification found non-KhoeSanid morphology is represented by several dated individuals as early as 9,000 years BP. This indication of non-KhoeSanid morphology may hint at possible admixture of the KhoeSan population with outsiders, but is a stronger indicator that origins of KhoeSan craniofacial patterns are not yet fully understood.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Craniology -- South Africa.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40434</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spontaneous recovery in Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition</field><field name="creator">Leung, Hiu Tin, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments reported in the present thesis examined the behavioural processes of Pavlovian fear extinction and latent inhibition. The first series of experiments studied the reacquisition of extinguished fear responses following different amounts of extinction training. Rapid reacquisition occurred when rats were reconditioned after moderate extinction, showing that the original learning remained intact across this extinction. In contrast, when reconditioning was given after massive extinction, reconditioned responding was first depressed but then spontaneously recovered over time. This suggests that massive extinction produces a relatively permanent loss of the originally learned responding, while additionally imposes on the extinguished CS a transient latent inhibitory process that prevented the immediate but not the delayed expression of reconditioning.  The second series of experiments studied the impact of spontaneous recovery of extinguished fear responses on their additional extinction. These experiments demonstrated that a CS that had time to show spontaneous recovery underwent greater response loss across additional extinction than one lacking recovery. They also showed that an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS showing recovery suffered greater response loss than an excitor extinguished in compound with a CS lacking recovery. Further, extinction of a compound composed of two CSs, one showing recovery and a second lacking recovery, produced greater extinction to the CS that showed recovery. These results show that spontaneous recovery of extinguished responses deepens their extinction through an error-correction mechanism regulated by both common and individual error terms.  The third series of experiments studied the spontaneous recovery of latently inhibited and extinguished fear responses in within-subject designs. Using a compound test procedure, a CS that had received extensive preexposure or extensive extinction was found to have undergone greater spontaneous recovery relative to a CS just moderately preexposed or moderately extinguished. A CS given a mixed history of preexposure and extinction also underwent greater recovery relative to a CS just preexposed or just extinguished. These results suggest that both latent inhibition and extinction share a transient depressive process, and that the resulting recovery of responding is proportional to the amount of this depression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">spontaneous recovery</field><field name="subject">extinction</field><field name="subject">latent inhibition</field><field name="subject">fear</field><field name="subject">conditioning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43701</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anthropometric study of the femur - an automated approach</field><field name="creator">Lau, Chi Bang Abe, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Knowledge of anatomy is an elementary step towards the understanding of the human body. First used by Alphonse Bertillon as an identification system, anthropometry refers to the measurements of human individuals. In orthopaedics, comparative analysis is widely used in the understanding of morphological variance due to races, sex and pathological conditions. The characterization of bone and joint geometry has also been a foundation of modern surgical implant design. Traditional anthropometric studies rely on physical measurements by means of osteometric table. Recent advancements of 3-D imaging modalities and image processing techniques have empowered more fine-grained anthropometric characterization. The inspiration for the study is:  - the understanding of anatomy originating from the clinical domain have shown to contribute to undesirable inconsistency in the image processing domain.  - the difficulty of existing automated anthropometric methodology in handling pathological femur.  - the tedious amount of manual and subjective work involved with the increasing amount of high resolution imaging data.  The aim of the study is to:  - develop a consistent and robust methodology in accurate extraction of anthropometric parameters on the femur.  - increase the level of automation on the process of anthropometric parameter extraction. With the bridging of anthropometry and the image processing disciplines, a robust methodology of anthropometric parameter extraction with high level of automation was developed, implemented and tested.  A dataset comprised of femoral CT scans of 19 healthy Australian, 10 healthy Japanese, 15 Japanese diagnosed with primary or secondary hip osteoarthritis and 20 adult sheep was utilized for testing. Intra-class correlation and Cronbach's &#945; were extensively employed to evaluate the intra-rater, interrater and repeated scans consistency of the proposed methodology. High correlation values (mean &gt; 0.95) were noted suggesting a high consistency of the methodology. All healthy and osteoarthritis human datasets were processed successfully. With the structural similarity between the sheep and human femur, the robustness was further demonstrated by accurate processing of the sheep dataset without the need of any modification of the underlying methodology. The methodology proposed is highly automated and requires very few user interactions in the parameter extraction stage.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CT</field><field name="subject">Anthropometric</field><field name="subject">Femur</field><field name="subject">Imaging</field><field name="subject">Orthopaedic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43647</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brief intervention for cannabis use among young people</field><field name="creator">Martin, Greg, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The overall aims of the current thesis were to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a brief motivational and cognitive-behavioural intervention in reducing cannabis use and cannabis related problems among Australian adolescent cannabis users: the Adolescent Cannabis Check-up. In addition it was intended to develop and psychometrically assess instruments to measure cannabis problems and cannabis dependence among adolescent cannabis users. The thesis is presented as a series of four related studies. Study 1 consists of an uncontrolled feasibility study of a brief (2-3 session) motivational intervention designed for adolescent cannabis users. Included in the intervention model was a separate session for concerned parents. The data analysis for this study was conducted in a pre-test post-test design and demonstrated that participation in the intervention was associated with improved outcomes. The intervention was shown to be feasible and acceptable to participants. Study 2 comprises an assessment of the psychometric performance of the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) in a population of adolescent cannabis users. Study 3 describes the development and psychometric testing of a novel assessment instrument designed to measure cannabis-related problems (other than dependence) among young people. Finally, Study 4 is a randomised controlled trial of the Adolescent Cannabis Check-up intervention, which builds on the feasibility study and incorporates the assessment instruments that were evaluated as valid and reliable in Studies 2 and 3. As hypothesised, significandy greater reductions in cannabis use and symptoms of cannabis dependence were found in the intervention group compared with the delayed treatment control group, which provides evidence for the efficacy of the intervention.

Wall climbing robots can be used to gain access to or inspect space that is not easily accessible or dangerous for human operators. The range of applicable fields encompasses industrial processes and inspection, exploration, rescue and monitoring. The smaller robots can be used for surveillance purposes due to their stealthy nature. Larger crawling robots may be used to carry out specific tasks such as sand blasting of ship hulls and blasting and spray painting of large containers such as cylindrical storage tanks used by the chemical, petroleum and nuclear industries. Their flexibility and mobility mean that they can accomplish tasks that would be impossible for more conventional robots.  The flexibility of mobility that such robots gain from their ability to move on all surfaces rather than only horizontal ones creates some unique challenges. Broadly, they can be split into three categories: robot design, robot control and motion planning, and environmental mapping and localisation. This thesis examines the first two of these problems. A prototype bipedal robot has been built and a second designed in order to capitalise on the experience gained with the first. An in-depth examination of the motion planning problem has been made and new techniques to tackle this problem have been developed. Such techniques are not limited to applications with wall climbing robots as there is commonality with more traditional fixed manipulators. Finally, the planning techniques were combined with the robot design in a test scenario that validated both the design and the motion planning techniques developed throughout the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Climbing robot</field><field name="subject">Motion planning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43685</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of acid-cleavable polymeric nano/microparticles for delivery of therapeutics</field><field name="creator">Chan, Yannie Ka Yan, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">For controlled drug delivery applications, an ideal carrier system should release its drug payload only at the site where the therapeutic activity is required. One elegant strategy for site-selective release of drugs is to utilize the acidic sites in the body, for example, tumor sites and intracellular endocytic compartments. The objective of this thesis is to develop a series of new acid-cleavable polymeric nanoparticles for pH-triggered delivery oftherapeutics. Four new acid-cleavable benzaldehyde acetal crosslinkers have been designed and synthesized. They were then used in the generation of acid-labile polymeric nanoparticle drug carrier systems via various synthetic strategies and drug loading approaches for the delivery of therapeutics with different nature: (l) the coreshell poly(butyl acrylate)-g-poly(polyethylene glycol acrylate) nanoparticles, synthesized via the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-mediated dispersion polymerization, were used for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs; (2) the core-crosslinked poly(hydroxyethyl acrylate)-b-poly(butyl acrylate) copolymer micelles, synthesized via the RAFT-mediated chain-extension polymerization, were used for the delivery of an antitumor drug, doxorubicin; (3) the poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) microgel particles, synthesized via the inverse-emulsion polymerization, were used for the delivery of biomacromolecular drugs. The designed physiochemical features such as the size, surface chemistry, cytotoxicity and the pH-triggered drug release properties of the developed carrier systems have been assessed. The synthesized systems offered release of the drug payload at slightly acidic conditions. The structural integrity of the polymeric carriers remained intact in the physiological, neutral pH conditions. The results support the potential value of the developed systems to be used for acidic-site delivery of therapeutics e.g. tumor sites and intracellular compartments.

Redefining petrophysical properties based on well logs in shaly sand reservoirs by using fundamental geologic attributes is an important tool in developing subsurface hydrocarbon resources. Studies of the electrical anisotropy of shaly sands have shown that the level of our understanding and our ability to correctly evaluate low resistivity and low contrast pay can be greatly improved.  The model developed in this thesis is similar in form to the shaly sand Dual Water model by Clavier et al. (1984). It is an experiment based model designed to directly assess and quantify the mineralogical and electrical effects of clay minerals in heterogeneous reservoirs. Clay minerals usually have multiple effects on petrophysical properties obtained from geophysical well log measurements. The total expansible clay model evaluates these effects via direct measurement of independent mineralogy and conductivity of clay minerals within reservoir sands.  This model integrates the following as an effective basis for characterizing shaly sand reservoirs:  ??? Rietveld based Siroquant assay for quantitative X-ray diffraction, used in   determining mineral percentages from standard XRD trace patterns, ??? Cation exchange capacity, used to determine the quantity of cations involved in the exchange at the shale-water interface,  ??? Porosity, permeability, density and resistivity measurements, ??? Thin section petrography, used in identifying mineral patterns, visible porosity and reservoir quality.  Overall, application of correlations drawn from the model yields improved results for water saturation which appeared consistent with those earlier calculated using known water saturation models (Clavier et al Dual Water model, 1984, Juhasz, 1981). A total of twenty three samples from two wells in the Cliff Head fIeld were analyzed for this study.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cations.</field><field name="subject">Reservoirs -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">X-ray diffraction.</field><field name="subject">Reservoirs -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Reservoirs -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptation and self-organization in evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="creator">Whitacre, James M., Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The objective of Evolutionary Computation is to solve practical problems (e.g.optimization, data mining) by simulating the mechanisms of natural evolution. This thesis addresses several topics related to adaptation and self-organization in evolving systems with the overall aims of improving the performance of Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), understanding its relation to natural evolution, and incorporating new mechanisms for mimicking complex biological systems.  Part I of this thesis presents a new mechanism for allowing an EA to adapt its behavior in response to changes in the environment. Using the new approach, adaptation of EA behavior (i.e. control of EA design parameters) is driven by an analysis of population dynamics, as opposed to the more traditional use of fitness measurements. Comparisons with a number of adaptive control methods from the literature indicate substantial improvements in algorithm performance for a range of artificial and engineering design problems.  Part II of this thesis involves a more thorough analysis of EA behavior based on the methods derived in Part 1. In particular, several properties of EA population dynamics are measured and compared with observations of evolutionary dynamics in nature. The results demonstrate that some large scale spatial and temporal features of EA dynamics are remarkably similar to their natural counterpart. Compatibility of EA with the Theory of Self-Organized Criticality is also discussed.  Part III proposes fundamentally new directions in EA research which are inspired by the conclusions drawn in Part II. These changes involve new mechanisms which allow selforganization of the EA to occur in ways which extend beyond its common convergence in parameter space. In particular, network models for EA populations are developed where the network structure is dynamically coupled to EA population dynamics. Results indicate strong improvements in algorithm performance compared to cellular Genetic Algorithms and non-distributed EA designs. Furthermore, topological analysis indicates that the population network can spontaneously evolve to display similar characteristics to the interaction networks of complex biological systems.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evolutionary computation.</field><field name="subject">Algorithms.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40444</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ultrasonic stochastic localization of hidden discontinuities in composites using  multimodal probability beliefs</field><field name="creator">Warraich, Daud Sana, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a technique used to stochastically estimate the location of hidden discontinuities in carbon fiber composite materials. Composites pose a challenge to signal processing because speckle noise, as a result of reflections from impregnated laminas, masks useful information and impedes detection of hidden discontinuities. Although digital signal processing techniques have been exploited to lessen speckle noise and help to localize discontinuities, uncertainty in ultrasonic wave propagation and broadband frequency based inspections of composites still make it a difficult task. The technique proposed in this thesis estimates the location of hidden discontinuities stochastically in one- and two-dimensions based on statistical data of A-Scans and C-Scans. Multiple experiments have been performed on carbon fiber reinforced plastics including artificial delaminations and porosity at different depths in the thickness of material. A probabilistic approach, which precisely localizes discontinuities in high and low amplitude signals, has been used to present this method. Compared to conventional techniques the proposed technique offers a more reliable package, with the ability to detect discontinuities in signals with lower intensities by utilizing the repetitive amplitudes in multiple sensor observations obtained from one-dimensional A-Scans or two-dimensional C-Scan data sets. The thesis presents the methodology encompassing the proposed technique and the implementation of a system to process real ultrasonic signals and images for effective discontinuity detection and localization.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Composites</field><field name="subject">Ultrasonics</field><field name="subject">Non Destructive Testing</field><field name="subject">Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics</field><field name="subject">Delamination</field><field name="subject">Porosity</field><field name="subject">Probabilistic Robotics</field><field name="subject">Multimodal Probability Beliefs</field><field name="subject">Three Dimensional Images</field><field name="subject">Statistical Signal Processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43719</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Locomotion of bipedal humanoid robots: planning and learning to walk</field><field name="creator">Yik, Tak Fai, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pure reinforcement learning does not scale well to domains with many degrees of freedom and particularly to continuous domains. In this thesis, we  introduce a hybrid method in which a symbolic planner constructs all approximate solution to a control problem.. Subsequently, a numerical optimisation algorithm is used to refine the qualitative plan into an operational policy. The method is demonstrated on the problem of learning a stable walking gait for a bipedal robot.  The contributions of this thesis are as follows. Firstly, the thesis proposes a novel way to generate gait patterns by using a genetic algorithm to generate walking gaits for a humanoid robot using zero moment point as the stability criterion. This is validated on physical robot. Second, we propose an innovative generic learning method that utilises the trainer's domain knowledge about the task to accelerate learning and extend the capabilities of the learning algorithm. The proposed method, which takes advantage of domain knowledge and combines symbolic planning and learning to accelerate and reduce the search space of the learning problem,  is tested on a bipedal humanoid robot learning to walk. Finally, it is shown that the extended capability of the learning algorithm handles high complexity learning tasks in the physical world with experimental verification on a physical robot.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Robots -- Motion -- Planning.</field><field name="subject">Locomotion.</field><field name="subject">Mobile robots.</field><field name="subject">Bipedalism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of B cells in type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Cox, Selwyn Lewis, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease where the immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells within the pancreas. Due to the difficulty of obtaining relevant tissue samples from patients at risk of disease, many researchers have utilized the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse as a model of T1D due to their natural high susceptibility for this disease which shares many characteristics with human patients. This model has been critical for uncovering many mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of T1D including the key roles played by autoreactive T cells in the destruction of beta cells. More recently, NOD mice have shown that self-reactive B cells act as important antigen presenting cells for activating and amplifying the T cell response against beta cells. In order to identify faulty self-tolerance mechanisms causing production and activation of B cells recognizing beta cell proteins, we have developed a transgenic mouse model whereby elevated numbers of B cells are made specific for a neo-self antigen whose expression is restricted to beta cells on the T1D-prone NOD genetic background and compared it to that of transgenic mice of the non-autoimmune prone C57BL/6 (B6) genetic background. These studies revealed that NOD and B6 B cells can both be effectively tolerized to the model beta cell-restricted antigen. However, provision of help from activated T cells readily overturned this tolerance on the NOD but not the B6 background.  Prior evidence has associated Idd5 (chromosome 1) and Idd9/11 (chromosome 4) diabetes susceptibility loci in NOD mice with the development of self reactive B cells contributing to T1D. The gene encoding CTLA-4 has been identified as the major candidate susceptibility gene within Idd5, thus leading to our studies comparing B cell expression of this molecule in NOD and diabetes-resistant strains. Although almost always associated with down-modulating T cells responses, our studies and that of others confirm expression of CTLA-4 by activated B cells. We encountered B cell expression of CTLA-4 to vary from that of T cells, being expressed earlier and predominantly on the cell surface rather than within intracellular vesicles. Our studies also showed aberrant expression of different splice variants of CTLA-4 by NOD B cells compared to diabetes-resistant mice controlled by genes within and outside the Idd5 genetic locus. Hence, these studies raise the possibility that CTLA-4 may contribute to T1D through its actions on both T and B cells.  Given the large nature of the Idd9/11 susceptibility locus in NOD mice and the absence of any strong candidate genes that may influence the diabetogenic capacity of B cells in this strain, we resorted to microarray technology to reveal putative genes within this genomic region with the potential to control the B cell phenotype. We focused our microarray studies on the first transitional (T1) B cell population in the spleen given that it is an important stage of tolerance to peripherally expressed self-antigens which have been found to possess various defects in NOD mice. Comparing gene expression profiles of NOD T1 B cells that expressed susceptibility or resistance alleles at the Idd9/11 locus identified 20 differentially expressed genes with the potential to contribute to development of diabetogenic B cells.  Overall, data presented in this thesis provides a greater understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying B cell contribution to T1D in NOD mice. These data are hoped to eventually lead to the development of selective strategies for removing or inhibiting only those B cells that contribute to development of T1D while ensuring that humoral immunity to foreign pathogens remains intact in human patients at risk of developing disease.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autoimmunity</field><field name="subject">Type 1 diabetes</field><field name="subject">B cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43789</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the effects of albendazole on human ovarian carcinoma cells</field><field name="creator">Chu, Stephanie Wai Ling, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Paclitaxel (PTX) is an effective anti-mitotic drug. It stops cancer from spreading by interfering with the microtubule dynamics which in turn leads to cell cycle arrest and eventually cell death. Despite the clinical success in treating different types of cancers, resistance to PTX remains a major hurdle for successful treatment in relapse patients. Albendazole (ABZ) is a popular anthelmintic used world-wide for the treatment of various types of helmintic infections. In helminthes, ABZ binds to ??-tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerisation. It was subsequently found that ABZ has anti-cancer activity. This study was carried out to study the effects of ABZ on PTX sensitive and PTX resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells. Cell growth assays revealed that the anti-proliferative activity of ABZ was not only effective on the PTX-sensitive human ovarian carcinoma cell line lA9, but also on its PTX-resistant sub-line, lA9PTX22. The ICso values of ABZ in lA9 and lA9PTX22 were 205 nM and 322 nM, respectively. Confocal images demonstrated that ABZ disrupted the microtubule network and caused formation of short microtubule bundles in both cell lines. Further analysis using tubulin polymerisation assay showed that the percentage of polymerised tubulin in lA9 and lA9PTX22 was increased by 58.9 % and 20.6 % respectively. Together, these results revealed for the first time that ABZ interacts with microtubules in human cancer cells and causes their polymerisation. It was also demonstrated that ABZ increased the release of cytochrome c, an important component of the intrinsic pathway in apoptosis. It was found that the expression of Bim, a BH-3 only pro-apoptotic protein was not elevated after ABZ treatment. The results presented in this study provide some information on the effect of ABZ on the microtubule network which could relate to its apoptotic effect in human ovarian carcinoma cells.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human beings.</field><field name="subject">Albendazole.</field><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Diseases -- Cytodiagnosis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the secretome and type II secretion in pseudoalteromonas tunicata</field><field name="creator">Evans, Flavia F., Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The eukaryote-associated Pseudoalteromonas tunicata produces two pigments and several other bioactive compounds that are able to inhibit a range of marine organisms including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, algal spores and invertebrate larvae. Early studies suggested that the production of bioactive compounds is correlated with pigmentation in P. tunicata. In one of these studies, a transposon mutagenesis library identified a white mutant, wmpD-, which had been disrupted in a gene encoding a component of the type 11 secretion (T2S) machinery. The T2S system is involved in the transport of different extracellular enzymes in many bacteria. In some cases, the T2S pathway also exports proteins that remain attached to the cells. This thesis aimed to investigate the role of the T2S pathway in the production of the pigments and bioactive compounds in P. tunicata. In order to gain insight into this relationship, two proteomics approaches (2D-PAGE and iTRAQ) were applied to investigate the profile of the secreted proteins (or secretome) in P. tunicata wild-type and the white mutant wmpD-.  Proteomic analysis using 2D-PAGE revealed that 23 proteins were differentially expressed between P. tunicata Wt and the mutant wmpD-. The identities of some of these proteins could be correlated with the function of the T2S system in P. tunicata. The role of one of the proteins identified using 2D-PAGE was further investigated through the construction of a gene knockout mutant (hiik mutant). The supernatant activity of the hiik mutant was compared to that of P. tunicata Wt, and it was found that the HiiA protease is required to block the activity of antimicrobial peptides, such as cecropins, produced by eukaryotic hosts in the environment.  The second proteomics approach (iTRAQ) used in this thesis, enabled the relative quantitation of a number of proteins in the supernatant of P. tunicata Wt and the white mutant wmpD-. Some proteins with no function to date (hypothetical) were absent in the extracellular fraction of the wmpD- mutant, indicating they may be transported to the extracellular environment via the T2S pathway in P. tunicata. The comparative analysis of the secretome also revealed that TonS-related proteins, involved in iron acquisition, were up-regulated in the wmpD- mutant, possibly to compensate for the lack of TonS-dependant receptors in the outer membrane. Assays for iron binding activity showed that P. tunicata Wt seems to release iron binding compounds (or siderophores) constitutively into the supernatant, in contrast to the white mutant wmpD-, which responds to iron limitation by increasing the production of siderophores. Further outer membrane fractionation studies, indicated that the P. tunicata T2S system is likely to be involved in the transport of TonB-dependant receptors to the outer membrane.  The overall results discussed in this thesis indicate that the T2S system has an essential role in the general physiology of P. tunicata, as for iron metabolism, as well as in the in the relationship between this bacterium and eukaryotic hosts in the environment.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tunicata.</field><field name="subject">Secretion.</field><field name="subject">Pseudoalteromonas.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40449</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of bladder cancer progression</field><field name="creator">Hung, Tzong-Tyng, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bladder cancer (BICa) is the second most common genitourinary cancer, affecting both men and women. Most (70%) cases present at the superficial stage; 20% of these recur with muscle-invasive disease. Major genetic alterations associated with BICa include: loss/gain in expression or mutations in Retinoblastoma (RB) gene, human epidermal growth factor receptors (HERs), H-ras, p53 and FGFR3. Only p53 mutations are well correlated with invasive BICa; other changes show variable correlations with disease status. To understand the progression of BICa, a model of nine human BICa cell sublines derived from a single parent but differing in in vivo characteristics, has been developed previously. These cells represent a heterogenous population from a single tumour and a model of different stages of BICa progression, from non-tumourigenic to invasive. Two sublines were selected for further investigation: C3 (non-tumourigenic) and B8 (invasive). These were transfected with green (C3-GSP-2) and red fluorescent reporters (B8-RSP-gck) respectively to investigate the effects of their co-injection in vivo, specifically, promotion of C3 tumour growth by B8 cells. Surprisingly, B8 tumour growth was inhibited by C3 cells in vivo at different cell numbers and proportions of cells injected. Microarray analysis of C3 and B8 cells revealed differential expression of 1367 genes with dramatic differences in the transforming growth  factor- ?? and integrin-mediated pathways. Gene expression of BMP2,INHBB, FST, NOG, ID4 and TGF- ??1, in the TGF- ?? pathway was further analysed with qRT-PCR in all nine sublines. Expression of BMP2 was significantly related to tumourigenic potential (p=0.0238, Mann-Whitney) and INHBB to invasive ability (p=0.0476, Mann-Whitney).  The BICa model did not include a metastatic component. To broaden the model, cell lines were established from an invaded lymph-node (B8-RSP-LN) and a bonemetastasis (B8-RSP-BN) after subcutaneous and intra-cardiac injection of B8- RSP-gck cells. No significant differences were observed in the migratory capability and anchorage-independent colony formation of these metastatic cells compared with B8 cells. Evaluation of expression of the panel of TGF-beta genes (BMP2, INHBB, FST, NOG, /04 and TGF- (31) and metastasis-related genes (MMP9, MMP2 and KAI1) indicated that expression of BMP2, FST, /04 and MMP9 was decreased or lost in the metastatic sublines.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bladder -- Cancer.</field><field name="subject">Genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40450</field></doc><doc><field name="title">(Per)Forming a public private partnership: the agency of accounting and other practices</field><field name="creator">Andon, Paul James, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the accounting and other practices performed as part of trials experienced by interested actors in forming a Public Private Partnership (PPP) scheme. Prompted by the high visibility of PPP schemes and a lack of understanding about the situated roles and effects of accounting and other practices in motivating and appraising such schemes, two practice-oriented research problems are investigated. Firstly, how does an ambition for a PPP scheme form in particular times and places. Secondly, what is the agency of accounting and other appraisal processes in trialling a proposed PPP scheme. Following an introductory section, this thesis proceeds via three papers. The first paper reviews the extant accounting-related literature on PPP schemes along five research themes adapted from Broadbent &amp; Laughlin (1999, 2004), highlighting the literary contributions and future research opportunities in this area. The second and third papers focus on the experiences of interested actors in trialling possibilities for a public housing PPP in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW), using field-based research. The aim of the second paper is to understand how an ambition for a PPP can become accepted through efforts to ??envisage value?? for such schemes in particular times and places. The third paper investigates the roles and effects of accounting and other appraisal practices mobilised to translate an ambition for a PPP scheme into an agreement that promises a ??Value for Money?? (VFM) outcome. Collectively, these papers contribute to extant knowledge about the involvement of accounting and other practices in the performance of ??value?? in PPP schemes by: (i) illustrating how an ambition for a PPP scheme forms through ??envisaging value??; (ii) explicating the agency of accounting and other practices in conferring VFM with situated meaning; (iii) contradicting the dominant status attributed to the involvement of accounting calculations in PPP schemes; and (iv) highlighting the various ways in which interested actors can cope with and act in the face of significant uncertainties. Overall, these contributions further our understanding of how proposed PPP schemes are (per)formed through the complex of activities (including accounting) and interests tied to the achievement of such schemes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Value for money</field><field name="subject">Public private partnerships</field><field name="subject">Accounting practices</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modification of fly ash colour from grey black to near white and incoporation of fly ash in polypropylene polymer</field><field name="creator">Zaeni, Akhmad, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Particulate filled polymer composites are gaining growing acceptance in the commodity industry because the properties can be adjusted according to the industry's requirements. As particulate filler, fly ash is ready to compete with other particular fillers in polymer composites industries. Although fly ash is a cheap material but the fact that fly ash is grey-black in colour, limits the application of fly ash only to product where colour is not important. As such, a method was needed to be developed to increase the whiteness of fly ash without reducing the advantages of it as a cheap material.  In this research, twelve commercially provided fly ash samples from Australian thermal power stations were investigated with respect to composition. Seven of them were thermally modified and further investigated and characterized with respect to colour, size, size distribution, and density. Of these seven fly ashes a particular grade was modified to a whiteness of 93.3 in L*a*b* scale (using barium sulfate as standard), without changing other inherent properties such as particle size and density. By comparison L*a*b* value for Omy carb 20, based on calcium carbonate is 96.9. The whiteness of fly ash was increased using a one stage thermal method ensuring the related cost of production would be not a major hurdle.  The next aspect of the thesis involved incorporating as-received and heat treated fly ash samples in isotactic polypropylene up to 80 parts of fly ash per hundred resins (phr), demonstrating that fly ash content in polypropylene composites can be quite high with properly maintained combination of mechanical properties -- in particular up to 200 % improvement in Young's modulus and 63 % gain in notched impact properties, as explained in the thesis.  Whilst the Young's modulus properties of the fly ash PP composites match very well with Kerner model, they lie in between the Rule of Mixture series and parallel. The tensile strength properties obtained in this research are at least 25 % higher than those predicted by Nielsen, Landon and Nicolais; whereas the strain to failure values are between 25 - 50 % higher than those predicted by Nielsen, and Smith.  Whilst tensile strength of the fly ash filled polypropylene composites were less than the original polypropylene samples, as normally reported in the literature, in this thesis surface modification of fly ash particles by using 10% vinyl triethoxy silane (VTES) coupling agent gave a nominal increase in tensile strength especially at higher fly ash content. The final aspect involved study of oxidation behavior of fly ash filled polypropylene composites. Fillers, including fly ash can shorten the life time of polymers from both chemical as well as physical factors. As-received fly ash contains iron based impurities which may catalyze the anti oxidant in polypropylene, therefore reducing the service life time of the polymer. In this work, thermal treatment studies showed that the iron in fly ash can be changed to a chemically inert material so the effective service life of the polymer will only be influenced by physical factors. Therefore thermal treatment of fly ash not only increases the whiteness but also it reduces the risk of the filler on the life time of the polymer, and hence the composites.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polypropylene.</field><field name="subject">Fly ash.</field><field name="subject">Colour modification.</field><field name="subject">Composites.</field><field name="subject">Mechanical properties.</field><field name="subject">Thermal properties.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single channel speech enhancement based on perceptual temporal masking model</field><field name="creator">Wang , Yao, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In most speech communication systems, the presence of background noise causes the quality and intelligibility of speech to degrade, especially when the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is low. Numerous speech enhancement techniques have been employed successfully in many applications. However, at low signal-to-noise ratios most of these speech enhancement techniques tend to introduce a perceptually annoying residual noise known as "musical noise". The research presented in this thesis aims to minimize this musical noise and maximize the noise reduction ability of speech enhancement algorithms to improve speech quality in low SNR environments.  This thesis proposes two novel speech enhancement algorithms based on Weiner and Kalman filters, and exploit the masking properties of the human auditory system to reduce background noise. The perceptual Wiener filter method uses either temporal or simultaneous masking to adjust the Wiener gain in order to suppress noise below the masking thresholds. The second algorithm involves reshaping the corrupted signal according to the masking threshold in each critical band, followed by Kalman filtering.  A comparison of the results from these proposed techniques with those obtained from traditional methods suggests that the proposed algorithms address the problem of noise reduction effectively while decreasing the level of the musical noise. In this thesis, many other existing competitive noise suppression methods have also been discussed and their performance evaluated under different types of noise environments. The performances were evaluated and compared to each other using both objective PESQ measures (ITU-T P.862) and subjective listening tests (ITU-T P.835).

The incidences of both are increasing at an alarming rate. Excessive consumption of nutrient rich foods have been implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms involved in the onset of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle caused by acute nutrient oversupply in vivo have not been fully elucidated. The broad aim of this thesis was to examine the mechanisms associated with the onset of skeletal muscle insulin resistance in models of acute nutrient oversupply.  The effect of glucose oversupply was investigated in the first study, which resulted in insulin resistance at the whole body and skeletal muscle level following 5h of glucose infusion, but not after 3h. There was no change in markers of oxidative stress over the same time course during which insulin resistance developed. Furthermore, co-infusion of the antioxidant taurine had no effect on the decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle from glucose infused animals. There was no evidence of activation of inflammatory/stress signalling pathways or defects in the phosphorylation state of multiple insulin signalling intermediates over the same time course. In isolated soleus strips taken from control, 1h, or 5h glucose infused animals, insulin stimulated 2-deoxyglucose transport was similar. Although, insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis was significantly reduced after 5h of glucose infusion, in the presence of significantly increased glycogen content. The reduced flux through the glycogen synthesis pathway and a reduced content of glucose-6-phosphate suggests in this model that the rate limiting step has shifted from glucose transport to glucose phosphorylation by hexokinase (HK).  In an acute lipid and insulin infusion model, the onset of insulin resistance was similar to that observed in the glucose infusion model. The mechanisms for the insulin resistance in skeletal muscle in this model was not associated with defects in the phosphorylation of key insulin signalling intermediates or activation of inflammatory/stress signalling pathways. Furthermore, there was no change in markers of oxidative stress and the co-infusion of taurine had no effect on the onset of insulin resistance. There was an increased exposure of long chain acyl-CoA (LCACoA), although there was no change in the content of other lipid intermediates such as DAG or ceramides. Interestingly, muscle pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase 4 (PDHK4) protein content was significantly decreased in hyperinsulinaemic glycerol infused rats after 3 and 5h, and this decrease was blunted in muscle from hyperinsulinaemic 3 and 5h lipid infused rats. These findings suggest that lipid infusion may reduce glucose metabolism by inhibition of the glucose phosphorylation due to LCACoA inhibition of HK and mitochondrial substrate competition regulated by increased PDHK4.  In conclusion, the current studies demonstrate that the insulin resistance associated with nutrient oversupply was not associated with significant changes in phosphorylation of key insulin signalling intermediates, activation of inflammatory and stress signalling pathways, or a change in markers of oxidative stress. Overall, the studies in this thesis suggest that the initial onset of insulin resistance due to glucose and lipid oversupply (in the presence of high insulin) is associated with metabolic feedback regulation, which is likely to be a protective mechanism of the skeletal muscle to limit any further insult by the excess nutrients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">Skeletal muscle</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43635</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterising scholarly identities :a citation identity analysis of the field of the scientific study of consciousness</field><field name="creator">Orsatti, Joanne, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The professional profile of researchers is established through communication of scientific work practices, leading to the establishment of a scholarly identity.  Understanding scholarly identities is currently addressed through a conceptualisation of research narrative mechanisms. Citation and citing practices are a central component of scientific communication work practices. Therefore understanding these formal communication practices of researchers through their citing behaviours may contribute to the building of scholarly identity.  This study is undertaken to understand whether scholarly identity could be informed through the use of citation identities. Studies on the citation identities of individuals were conducted, using authors working in the area of Consciousness, which provided a diverse field of participants for the testing of citation analysis techniques. This is accomplished through methodological development and further examined using a combination of field-level and individual-level analyses.  A new methodology was developed for the generation of citing identities, based on the calculation of the Gini coefficient and the citee-citation ratio of authors' citing profiles. The resu!ting relationship was found to have high levels of consistency across a heterogenous set of researchers.  An exploration of identification of author characteristics was subsequently undertaken using the new methodology and existing citation analysis techniques. The techniques were successful in identifying departures from conventional citation practice, highlighting idiosyncrasies well, but otherwise understanding of scholarly identity through citation analysis was only marginally successful. Aportion of the difficulty of achieving clarity was the complexity of the Consciousness author set, which was useful for establishing broad applicability of a new methodology, but poor for judging its successful application.  In summary, definition of citing identity type offers possibilities for improving the understanding of scholarly identity, but will require further methodology development to reach its full potential.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Academic writing</field><field name="subject">Identity</field><field name="subject">Bibliographical citation -- Computer programs</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Faculty -- Research</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of high figure-of-merit thermoelectric materials</field><field name="creator">Tsai, Ping-Han, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the beginning of the industrial revolution in the late 18th century, there's an abrupt increase in need for energy and resources. Despite of advantages it offers, waste heat or energy generated by machines or vehicles exhaust is evolved into the surrounding atmosphere, resulting in the evolution of the Greenhouse effect. With rampant global warming, thermoelectricity - an environmentally benign technology that recovers waste heat and converts it directly into useful electricity or vice versa - has gradually become an interesting topic for researchers. Regardless, it has yet to be widely commercialised mainly due to its inferior energy conversion efficiency to the conventional power generators and cooling devices. The aim of this project was to explore ways of enhancing the efficiency of thermoelectric materials.  NaC0204 is one of the state-of-the-art p-type thermoelectric materials to date due to its superior thermoelectric properties and stability at elevated temperatures. As a result of its layered structure, NaC0204 is highly anisotropic in thermoelectric properties. Literatures revealed that the thermoelectric properties along the in-plane direction are superior to that along the out-of-plane direction, which emphasise the significance of texture. In this work, the texturing mechanisms and the texturing process as a function of sintering duration were studied in detail and the synthesis procedure of highly textured NaC0204-; materials was optimized. The results indicate that the extent of texture increased with increasing process duration and then reached the maximum when the materials were sintered at 900??C for 12 hrs. The texturing kinetics obeys an exponential relationship, suggesting that the texturing processing is dominated by self-diffusion mechanism. The experimental evidence also shows that the extent of texture decreased when the annealing time exceeded 12 hrs. The mechanisms of such deterioration were highly due to the nature of grain growth in ceramics.  Given that the Co ions in NaxC020 4-; have different valence between 3+ and 3.48+ depending on the Na content and have spins, it is expected that oxygen vacancies formed in the lattice would cause charge-spin interaction, which would have a profound effect on the thermoelectric properties. As part of current study, the oxygenation kinetics and possible mechanisms were investigated. Room temperature X-ray diffraction study shows a decrease in FWHM and a certain left shift of spectra for the oxygenated samples, suggesting an increase in d-spacing and lattice distortion as a result of oxygen deficiency. The extent of oxygen saturation increased with decreasing annealing temperature. The high oxygenation flux in the first three hours of annealing was possibly due to lower energy requirement for oxygen to occupy its vacant sites than that to interstitially occupy a site. These experimental results could be used to further study the oxygen dependence of thermoelectric performance. Moreover, the investigation of temperature effects on lattice structure of NaC02O4-; with/without oxygenation was carried out to understand oxygen contribution to the lattice structure and also thermal expansion behaviours. Refined high temperature XRD results revealed that lattice parameter a decreased and c increased over the temperature range investigated after oxygenation due to Coulomb interaction between the constituent ions. Linear thermal expansion coefficient along the a- b-axis direction is circa 1.105 x 10-5K-1 for the sample before oxygenation and 1.06 x 10-5K-1 after oxygenation. An almost three-fold increase was observed for the thermal expansion coefficient along the c-axis direction for the samples before and after oxygenation, suggesting that higher oxygen concentration suppresses the thermal expansion coefficient in all directions.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thermoelectric materials</field><field name="subject">Thermoelectricity</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40459</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation into the use of low aspect ratio spherical wells to reduce flow separation on an inverted wing in ground effect</field><field name="creator">Beves, Christopher Charles, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flow separation is a source of aerodynamic in-efficiency; however by using vortex generators the issue of flow separation can be controlled. This is of particular benefit to flows around bluff bodies which are susceptible to large scale separated flows, such as bodies in ground effect. Previous studies concerning heat transfer applications focused on the ability of low aspect ratio spherical wells (dimples) to produce vortices for flow mixing. Dimpled surfacing on an inverted Tyrrell026 airfoil in ground effect (indicative of high performance automotive aerodynamic applications e.g. Formula One) has been investigated for similar vortex enhanced wake reductions. Experimental measurements using Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) were taken inside a dimple to provide validation and verification of numerical analyses of dimple flows. The k-&#969; SST turbulence model showed good agreement to the experimental measurements. Additionally experiments were conducted using LDA and PIV with various configurations of dimple arrays placed from a fixed separation point of a 16&#730; rearward facing ramp to determine how the array configuration influenced the large scale separation. The airfoil wake with numerous dimple configurations and placements were measured using LDA. Results showed that an array of dimples with close dimple to dimple spacing there was flow recovery in the airfoil wake from the velocity deficit with no dimples of u/Uo,min=-0.1, to u/Uo,min=0.4 with a dimple array, (at &#945;=10&#730;, ground clearance h/c=0.313). At &#945;=10&#730; reductions in the wake size of 30%, 33%, 58% and 68% were found for the ground clearances of h/c=0.112, 0.134, 0.224 and 0.313 respectively. For numerous dimple array configurations, closely spaced dimple arrays were more effective in reducing the wake size, turbulence intensity and Reynolds stresses than those where dimple spacing was further apart. The chord wise location of the array on the wing affected the angle of incidence of the wing for which the wake was able to be reduced. Arrays placed towards the trailing edge improved wake losses at lower angles of incidence. Dimples placed further forward yielded the most improvement at higher angles of incidence, in part due to the increased venturi effect under the wing.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ground effect</field><field name="subject">Dimple</field><field name="subject">Airfoil</field><field name="subject">Wing</field><field name="subject">Low aspect ratio spherical wells</field><field name="subject">Cavity</field><field name="subject">Flow separation</field><field name="subject">Wake</field><field name="subject">LDA</field><field name="subject">PIV</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification and control of nonlinear laboratory processes</field><field name="creator">Xi, Zhiyu, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, a class of control and identification methods on a typical laboratory process - a ball and beam system - are discussed. The ball and beam is a common laboratory process which contains nonlinearity, a double integrator and time-delay. In our project, the hardware made by Wincon (Quanser SRV02 +BB01) is used. The main contribution of this work is the development of a variety of controller design methods, which together with suitable parameter identification techniques provide tools for rapid prototyping for real time control of processes within the laboratory, in preparation for industrial implementation of more complex schemes.  The novelty of this work lies in the use of model predictive control (MPC) methods based on a non-minimal state space formulation, which permits the inclusion of process measurements and actuations in the state vector, leading to controller designs which are immediately ready for on-line implementation.  A linear MPC controller based on a non-minimal state space model is based on an approximate linear model. The results from simulation and online experiment show that the linear MPC controller realizes a satisfying reference tracking in the face of nonlinearity and time-delay.  In the following chapter, a nonlinear Hammerstein model is identified, which is a type of reliable structure for describing nonlinear plants. A nonlinear MPC scheme is developed based on the Hammerstein model. An inversion block is created to cancel the effect of the nonlinearity. The performance IS also tested in both simulation and experiment.  Finally, MPC is combined with sliding mode control. The non-minimal state space model is also used here. In the first part of this chapter, the idea underlying sliding mode control contributes a method of modifying the definition of the cost function in MPC. In the second half, MPC is used to design the switching surface in sliding mode control. The performance of tests on the example (ball and beam system) illustrates that these are both valid methods for dealing with complex processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonlinear control theory.</field><field name="subject">Linear systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40461</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The production and properties of lightweight bulk metallic glasses</field><field name="creator">Laws, Kevin J., Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An inverted die casting technique has been developed for the rapid and reproducible production of high quality lightweight bulk metallic glass (BMG) castings. Comprehensive processing maps for producing lightweight BMG samples of cross section 3.15 mm x 7 mm and a length of 125 mm were developed as a means of identifying the optimum casting conditions for producing casting of high structural integrity, maximum length and enhanced surface quality. Utilising these maps, Mg65CU25Y10 and Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMGs were consistently produced using the inverted injection die casting method and a naturally cooled copper mould, by choosing injection parameters that stabilise the molten metal flow front within the mould cavity. Highest quality Mg65CU25Y10 BMG bars were produced in the casting temperature range of 560 C to 580 C and gate velocities in the range of 12.5 to 15 m/s. Highest quality Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG bars were produced in the casting temperature range of 480 C to 520 C and gate velocities in the range of 13.8 to 14.7 m/s. The casting parameter range for achieving the highest quality castings for the lightweight BMGs examined was found to be practically identical and related to the casting system geometry. The use of higher holding pressures when casting was also found to increase the sample surface quality due to a post-casting consolidation process during sample cooling.  As part of the experimental program, critical cooling rate experiments were carried out, whereby the change in casting temperature over time was measured between Tl and Tg. The resulting castings were analysed using x-ray diffraction (XRD). The Mg65CU25Y10 BMG was found to have a critical cooling rate between 49 and 61 C/sec, and may be gravity cast in a copper mould to achieve a completely amorphous structure between 3 and 3.75 mm, or readily cast using the inverted injection method successfully to obtain a thickness of 3.15 mm. The Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG was found to have a critical cooling rate between 150 and 170 C/sec, and may be cast using the inverted injection method to achieve a completely amorphous structure of a diameter 8 to 9 mm.  From the as-cast samples, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were carried out as to determine the thermal properties of both materials where it was found that the Mg65CU25Y10 BMG had glass transition and crystallisation temperatures that varied with heating rate. Tg varied from 138 C for a heating rate of 2 C/min to 148 C for a heating rate of 20C/min. Tx varied from 195 C for a heating rate of 2C/min to 213 C for a heating rate of 20C/min. This indicates a supercooled liquid (SCL) interval of 57 to 65 C. The Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG was found to have glass transition and crystallisation temperatures that were almost independent of heating rate. Tg varied from 102 C for a heating rate of 5 C/min to 105 C for a heating rate of 20 C/min. Tx remained relatively unchanged with heating rate at 137 C, indicating a SCL interval of 32C. Isothermal DSC results show that the onset of crystallisation occurs much more quickly in the Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG and follows a non-Arrhenius type relationship as opposed to the slower, Arrhenius crystallisation kinetics displayed by the Mg65CU25Y10 BMG.  In conjunction with this work, the elevated temperature mechanical properties of these BMGs was studied. When deformed in tension at an elevated temperature under constant strain rate conditions, it was found that an increase in test temperature resulted in a decrease in both peak stress and flow stress. It was also found that an increase in strain rate resulted in an increase in both peak stress and flow stress. It was established that Newtonian flow occurred at high temperatures in the SCL region and at lower strain rates. The Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG was found to be far more strain rate sensitive with respect to brittle fracture, exhibiting a maximum achievable strain rate for homogeneous flow of 10 -3/S compared to 10 -1/S for the Mg65CU25Y10 BMG. Elongations achieved for the Mg65CU25Y10 BMG exceeded 1300% compared to a maximum elongation of 598% for the Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG under constant temperature/ constant strain rate conditions, with elongation usually limited due to the onset of crystallisation.  Both BMGs were found to crystallise under certain deformation conditions. For these conditions, the Mg-based BMG was found to display a stress increase due to crystallisation prior to the times determined by static crystallisation experiments due to dynamic segregation of the amorphous phase into Cu rich and Y rich regions, as determined by atom probe tomography (APT). Where crystallisation occurred in the Ca-based BMG under dynamic conditions a delayed stress increase due to crystallisation was observed in comparison to static crystallisation experiments. The dynamic stabilisation (time delay to crystallisation) of the amorphous phase in the Ca65Mg15Zn20 alloy was found to decrease with increasing test temperature and decreasing strain rate. Constant load defomation experiments were carried out at a constant heating rate of 5 C/sec for the Ca65Mg15Zn20 BMG. It was found that stress overshoot behaviour was avoided and a strain of 850% was achieved prior to crystallisation hardening and subsequent failure which is larger than that observed in constant strain rate testing.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metallic glasses.</field><field name="subject">Founding .</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40462</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of accounting quality</field><field name="creator">Bayley, Luke, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Accounting numbers are not only the products of peripheral economic events, but, by and large, can be consciously influenced from the effects of calculated business decisions and the selective applications of alternative reporting procedures.

P. aeruginosa is capable of establishing complex. matrix-encased biofilms during colonization of both environmental and living host surfaces. Biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa are physiologically very different from free-living P. aeruginosa cells, and exhibit increased resistance to environmental stresses, including antibiotic treatment. While the development and establishment of P aeruginosa biofilms has been extensively studied in vitro, several new behaviours of P. aeruginosa in biofilms have recently been observed that may greatly impact on the spread, recolonization and function of biofilms. These processes include bacteriophage mediated lysis and dispersal of P. aeruginosa biofilms, and the generation of phenotypic and genetic variation among bacterial cells that disperse from the biofilm. In this project, the role of bacteriophage activity and phenotypic variation in the development of P. aeruginosa biofilms has been investigated.  Induction of a Pf1-like prophage of P aeruginosa (here named Pf4), during biofilm formation was characterized and was shown to increase over the progression of biofilm development. It was observed in this study that the activity of Pf4 caused the emergence of small colony variant (SCY) phenotypes in the effluent run-off from P. aeruginosa biofilms. Computational analysis of the genome ofPf4 resulted in the identification of a novel Toxin-Antitoxin (TA) gene pair, not previously identified within the genome of P. aeruginosa, of which the putative toxin gene product was determined here to play a role in growth-inhibition and the small colony phenotype of P. aeruginosa.  TA gene pairs are proposed to induce stress responses in host cells and therefore play a role in survival during periods of environmental stresses such as oxidative or starvation stress. To study the effects of the Pf4 toxin and its possible role in the stress response of P aeruginosa, the Pf4 toxin gene was cloned and placed under the regulation of an inducible arabinose promoter. The proteome expression and biofilm formation as a result of toxin over expression were compared. The proteomic studies performed here indicated that P. acrllginosu biofilms do respond to expression of the toxin component of this putative TA element by increased expression of stress related proteins. Many stress-related groups of proteins were found to be over expressed during induction of the toxin indicating a possible role in stress survival of P. acrllginosa.  Homology studies of the Pf4 toxin indicated a strong structural sequence relationship with the toxin ParE of the ParDE TA system. The mode of action of ParE toxin had previously been determined and showed the ParE toxin to be a strong gyrase inhibitor. The Pf4 antitoxin was, however, found to have homology to the Phd antitoxin of the Phd-Doe system of bacteriophage PI. The mode of action of the Doc protein remains to be clearly determined. To better understand the interaction between the Pf4 antitoxin and its cognate toxin protein interaction studies were performed. Peptide fragments of the Pf4 antitoxin were generated for an SPR binding assay and this study identified putative peptide sequences that are responsible for binding of the Pf4 antitoxin to its cognate toxin. Further investigation of a selected strong binding peptide showed that there were 3 key amino acids that were important in binding to the Pf4 toxin, namely His65, Ser67 and A 69 sp.  Overall, this study has identified a key role for bacteriophage Pf4 in biofilm development and phenotypic variation in P. aeruginosu, and has provided initial insight into the molecular mechanisms by which this bacteriophage influences growth and gene expression in this organism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biofilms.</field><field name="subject">Pseudomonas aeruginosa.</field><field name="subject">Bacteriophages.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular interactions between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment</field><field name="creator">Markovic, Ana, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common cause from death of disease in children. Whilst cure rates over the last 30 years have drastically improved, the children that do go on and relapse have a very poor prognosis. Additionally, the ones that do survive can have significant long term side effects from existing treatments. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of the relationship between leukaemia and its microenvironment is essential for the identification of novel targets for treatment and/or the manipulation of existing treatments. The role that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an integral component of both neovascularisation and normal haematopoiesis, plays in the progression and invasiveness of solid tumours is well established. However, its function in haematological malignancies has been a more recent and thus less considered observation. Human leukaemia cells secrete VEGF, which may act in a paracrine manner with the bone marrow microenvironment to promote the survival and proliferation of leukaemia cells. In addition to VEGF being produced by leukaemias, it also increases vascularity in the bone marrow and lymph nodes of patients.  Our previous work has established a panel of 10 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia xenografts from patient biopsies in NOD/SCID mice. Several of these secrete VEGF, and express the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT-3). FLT 3, a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), and its ligand, play an essential role in regulating normal haematopoiesis. This thesis builds on the previous work by examining the relationship between VEGF and FLT 3, two widely, yet independently studied molecules in leukaemia, with the aberrant expression of either having adverse outcomes for patients.  The results show that the high expression and activation of FLT 3, significantly increases the secretion VEGF. To assess whether VEGF secretion is triggered by FLT-3 signalling, we measured VEGF in the absence and presence of a class III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor (SU11657), humanised anti-FLT 3 blocking antibodies as well as decreasing the receptors with siRNA. All of these manipulations were able to decrease the secretion of VEGF in leukaemia cells. To further investigate this relationship, we examined the phosphorylation status of FLT-3 and the downstream signalling pathway. Our results indicate that FLT 3 signalling may be an important factor in the induction of VEGF secretion in a sub-type of leukaemia cells and in turn, VEGF secretion can be attenuated by an FLT-3 specific inhibitor. Two separate microarray studies were also used to assess simultaneous gene expressions between the leukaemia and bone marrow microenvironment, and to examine the effects of FL on ALL xenograft cells. The results of the microarray studies confirm the previously observed results regarding the manipulation of the microenvironment by the leukaemic cells. Inhibition of the FLT-3/VEGF pathway may disrupt paracrine signalling between leukaemia cells and the bone marrow microenvironment, and future studies into how this disruption may influence leukaemia cell responses to conventional chemotherapy are warranted.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VEGF</field><field name="subject">Leukaemia</field><field name="subject">FLT-3</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43576</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new variation of the frequency selective Kalman - Yakubovich - Popov lemma with applications in signal processing and control</field><field name="creator">Hoang, Hung Gia, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (KYP) lemma is a useful tool in control and signal processing that allows an important family of computationally intractable semi-infinite programs in the entire frequency range to be characterized by computationally tractable semidefinite programs. The first part of this thesis presents a new variation of the frequency selective Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov (FS-KYP) lemma for single input single output systems, which generalizes the conventional KYP lemma on given frequency intervals. Based on the transfer function representation of single input single output systems, the proposed FS-KYP lemma provides a unified framework to convert an important family of semi-infinite programs with generic frequency selective constraints that arise from a variety of analysis and synthesis problems for infinite impulse response systems into semidefinite programs. In contrast to existing variations of the FS-KYP lemma, which invariably involves Lyapunov variables of large dimensions, the proposed FS-KYP lemma is free from Lyapunov variables. As a consequence, the proposed semidefinite programs require a minimal number of additional variables, thus can be efficiently solved by general purpose semidefinite programming solvers on a standard personal computer. The second part of this thesis studies several applications of the FS-KYP lemma to control and signal processing. Firstly, we investigate the beam pattern synthesis of an antenna array with bounded sidelobe and mainlobe levels. It is shown that the pattern synthesis problem can be posed as a convex semi-infinite program that is turned into an semidefinite program via the proposed FS-KYP lemma. The attractive feature of the proposed method is that our semidefinite program uses only a minimal number of auxiliary variables. This subsequently enables the design of patterns for arrays with several hundred elements to be achieved on a standard personal computer using existing SDP solvers. Secondly, we develop an efficient method to design several types of digital and analog infinite impulse response filters and filter banks via the new FS-KYP lemma. The proposed method is more flexible than analytical methods in the sense that it allows direct control of more design parameters, which in turn enables more requirements such as degree of flatness to be incorporated into the design process. Finally, we examine some applications of the new FS-KYP to robustness analysis of continuous control systems. Specifically, we introduce a new bisection method to compute the H&#8734; gain of uncertain polytopic systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="subject">KYP lemma</field><field name="subject">SDP</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43770</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling secondary organic aerosol formation :from chemical mechanistic modelling to empirical modelling</field><field name="creator">Singh Peterson, Lila, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis is primarily concerned with modelling the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). SOAs cannot easily be measured with direct analytical chemical methods; indirect methods like applying organic carbon to elemental carbon ratios and utilising computer models have been employed to provide an estimate of the SOA mass concentrations in ambient air. The five models presented in this work were either developed or assessed using environmental chamber data.  Chamber experiments were undertaken using initial isoprene concentrations in the range of 22 ppb to 343 ppb, with the reactive organic carbon (ROC) to NOx ratios in the range of 2.0 to about 18. Chamber experiments were also performed for the a-pinene / NOx system with initial a-pinene concentrations ranging from 79 ppb to 225 ppb, with ROC/NOx ratios varying from 5.5 to about 41. All of the experiments were performed without the addition of propene or seed aerosol. Background aerosol levels were very low for the experiments presented in the thesis and so homogeneous nucleation processes were considered to occur in the chamber in addition to absorption and oligomerisation formation processes. Initial nucleation events resulting from the photooxidation of isoprene could be detected once the aerosol diameter was greater than 12 nm. In the a-pinene system,new particles formed via homogeneous nucleation processes were detectable in the 100-200nm diameter range.  The models presented range in complexity from the near explicit Master Chemical Mechanism to an empirical model whose key feature is its simplicity. The mechanistic model provides an insight into the SOA formation pathways and the influence of varying the initial experimental conditions and the duration of photooxidation on the simulated SOA composition. The aim of the empirical model is to simulate the SOA mass concentration produced during a chamber experiment. The development of the model is intentionally simple so that it can be applied to any hydrocarbon and has been applied successfully to isoprene and a-pinene chamber experiments. In this way, the empirical model is presented as an alternative approach to predicting the temporal variation in SOA mass concentrations.  An analysis of the partitioning absorption models developed by Odum et al. (1996) and Hoffmann et al. (1997) has informed the development of the SOA module which has been coupled to a 3D atmospheric model. Embodied within the SOA module is the gas / aerosol partitioning theory which includes the model proposed initially by Pankow et al. (1994) and by Odum et al.

In response to a critical analysis of these findings, a new technique and protocol for the assessment of walking stability was developed. This involved measuring and analysing head and pelvis accelerations while subjects walked on a level surface and an irregular surface. Gait patterns were studied in 30 young healthy subjects and two groups known to be at increased risk of falling - 100 subjects over the age of 75, and 30 subjects with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. A series of vision, sensation, strength, reaction time and balance tests were also undertaken to identify subjects??? physiological abilities and risk of falls. Acceleration patterns of the head and pelvis differed according to physiological risk of falling, particularly when walking on the irregular surface. Those with a high risk of falling walked with a reduced velocity, cadence and step length, and exhibited less rhythmic acceleration patterns at the head and pelvis. Gait patterns were significantly associated with leg strength, peripheral sensation and reaction time. It is concluded that subjects with a high physiological risk of falling exhibit characteristic patterns of walking that indicate an impaired ability to control the movement of the pelvis and head, which may predispose to loss of balance.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">accidental falls</field><field name="subject">balance</field><field name="subject">ageing</field><field name="subject">gait</field><field name="subject">gait in humans</field><field name="subject">human locomotion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The history of matter painting in Australia'</field><field name="creator">O'Carroll, Anthony Terrrence, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Master of Fine Art document examines the inception of Matter Painting as it occurred in Europe and it's following in Australia.

Within a climate of increased immigration and international awareness, Matter Painting was encountered by an initiated few. This history firstly begins with practitioners that were not in locale but rather overseas who were in close proximity to the centre of such avant-garde. It is not until the artist and critic Elwyn Lynn returns from his seminal overseas travels in 1959 and his first showing of "Matter" painting's in 1960 that Matter Painting in Australia gathered momentum.

This project investigates contemporary cultural issues within the context of critical/specific geographical sites. These locations are the Australian coastal border, and a refugee camp near the Kenyan/Sudanese border, known as Kakuma. 'The Glittering City'is an installation that incorporates elements of video, sculpture, sound and electronics in a kinetic 2 channel immersive video and (multi-channel) audio installation.  The key aims for the project are to raise awareness of the issues facing refugees and asylum seekers in relation to their sense of home. In order to accomplish this aim the research will extend upon prior research into embedded video sculptures. A subset of the key aim is to seek funding for the project. The installation is the third and final work from a trilogy of works that explores the themes journey, arrival and departure, respectively. The Glittering City is contextualised within four key areas inherent within the research practice. These key elements are 1. hybrid documentary art, 2. expanded cinema, 3. Technology and art, 4. culture and identity.  Key outcomes of the research are the production and installation of The Glittering City at Campbelltown Arts Centre, May 2007. An educational program also took place at the Centre to raise awareness of the themes the installation poses. The production of a catalogue for The Glittering City is an important device for disseminating the core concepts. For the costs of making the multi-channel production, the project successfully sought grant funding from Arts NSW. This resulted in a grant through their Western Sydney I Artists' Fellowship program. The Glittering City used further funding from the Campbelltown Arts Centre to cover catalogue production, invitation design, mail out and installation costs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Refugees -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Installations (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40468</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel redox molecules for surface electrochemistry</field><field name="creator">Odenthal, Katherine Jane, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research presented herein reports the development of two novel redox molecules for biosensing applications.  Frequently electrochemical biosensors necessitate the use of strictly controlled conditions including the pH of the surrounding solution.  Electrochemical biosensors that only operate under such conditions are not viable as portable sensors for in-field analysis.  Consequently, a method for measuring the pH in conjunction with electrochemical biosensors would provide an opening for such sensors in in-field analysis.  A novel redox molecule, JUGSH, has been prepared for this purpose.  In a separate investigation, a ruthenium complex has been prepared which allows tuning of its formal potential by altering the structure of one ligand.  This novel redox molecule is destined for use in multi-analyte arrays.  By altering the formal potential of the redox molecule, a series of redox reporters can be prepared to allow differentiation between analytes. The novel redox molecule JUGSH consists of a hydroxy-naphthoquinone with an alkanethiol chain that allows formation of a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of JUGSH on gold electrodes.  X-ray spectroscopy analysis was employed for characterisation. The electrochemical properties of a JUGSH SAM were investigated along with the pH dependence of the formal potential.  After further research into the pH dependence of the electron transfer rate coefficient, JUGSH was applied to the analysis of pH together with an electrochemical biosensor. Two peptide sensors for metal detection developed previously were employed to test the concept of measuring pH with JUGSH. The peptides employed were angiotensin I and Gly-Gly-His immobilised on a thioctic acid SAM and 3-mercaptopropionic acid SAM for lead and copper detection respectively.  JUGSH was demonstrated to have the ability to measure the pH of the analyte solution allowing compensation of the sensor??s electrochemical response. The angiotensin I sensor was shown to have a viable working range from pH 3 to pH 7. A ruthenium complex containing two bipyridine ligands and a diketone ligand has been prepared that shows a shift in the formal potential upon alteration of the diketone ligand. Modification of the complex to include methylamine groups was attempted but non-ideal electrochemistry was indicated and no shift in the formal potential was observed after modifying the diketone ligand. Further work is required before attachment of the complex to a surface can be investigated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43661</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An approach to the optimisation of partial extractions for use in geochemical exploration</field><field name="creator">Dalrymple, Iain , Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Geochemical exploration for mineral deposits has generally been restricted to regions dominated by residual regolith or where transported regolith cover is thin. A variety of partial geochemical extraction techniques, linked to new predictive models for element migration through transported regolith cover, have demonstrated a potential to detect deeply buried mineralisation under certain circumstances. Problems with the reliability and further development of such partial extractions are linked to the lack of information on either the form of metals or the factors that control the extraction of metals from regolith materials.  This study quantitatively examines the mechanisms of a range of partial extraction methods, based on a suite of surface regolith samples from the Mandamah Cu-Au deposit that is covered by 50m of transported regolith. Samples at were subjected to acetate, hydroxylamine.HCI and Na-pyrophosphate extractions at various reagent concentrations, pH values, temperatures and durations, following various sample preparation and chemical pretreatment permutations. The data were modelled, and reaction conditions subsequently optimized, on the basis of central composite designs.  Conventional partial extraction (acetate, hydroxylamine and aqua regia) data, displayed high variability for some major and trace metals surrounding the periphery of mineralisation at Mandamah but little indication of direct vertical migration of ore-related metals. The buffered acetate extraction is primarily controlled by the capacity of the solution to generate acid rather than exchange induced by the cation ofthe acetate salt. Trace metals were highly susceptible to readsorption effects. Acidic hydroxylamine extraction is driven by kinetically limited acid hydrolysis and the hydroxylamine concentration has little effect on metal extractability. Alkaline Na-pyrophosphate extraction proved difficult to model. Two new partial extractions developed in this study - alkaline hydroxylamine.HCI and pH-static calcium nitrate - offer a different functionality to conventional extractions and provide more coherent geochemical patterns at Mandamah related to the location of buried mineralisation. These patterns are also related to the capacity of samples to resist pH neutralization.  Systematic optimisation of geochemical extraction procedures is demonstrated to be an effective approach to improving detection of geochemical patterns in surface regolith that can be spatially related to the effects of mineralisation on the chemistry and mineralogy of overlying transported regolith cover.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exploration.</field><field name="subject">Regolith.</field><field name="subject">Extraction (Chemistry)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40473</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inkjet printing for commercial high efficiency silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Utama, Roland Yudadibrata, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">One way of reducing the cost of crystalline silicon solar cell fabrication is by increasing the conversion efficiency of the device. However, most high efficiency solar cell designs require more complex fabrication methods that also increase the fabrication cost. Photolithography is an example of such an indispensable but costly process. The most common use for photolithography in solar cell fabrication is for dielectric patterning. In this thesis, inkjet printing is proposed as an alternative method for dielectric patterning in solar cell fabrication. There are two inkjet printing methods developed in this thesis. The indirect inkjet patterning method involves the deposition of a suitable plasticiser droplet onto an intermediate resin coating layer on top of the dielectric surface. Diethylene glycol and novolac resin are used as the plasticiser and coating layer respectively. The plasticiser changes the permeability of the affected region of the resin such that it becomes permeable to liquid dielectric etchants. When the resin layer is removed, the printed pattern is transferred to the dielectric layer. The optimised process produces round openings with diameters as small as 30-35 &#956;m and continuous line patterns with width as narrow as 40-50 &#956;m. The direct inkjet patterning method involves the deposition of liquid phosphorus dopant sources onto both silicon and dielectric surfaces. Two types of phosphorus sources are used: phosphoric acid and specially-formulated dopant sources. Narrow lines as wide as 15-20 &#956;m are produced after appropriate surface treatments on both silicon and dielectric surfaces. Using this method, a process that simultaneously pattern the dielectric layer and diffuse the silicon underneath is developed. Various high efficiency solar cell structures such as selective emitter, localised contacts, surface texturing and edge isolation are demonstrated using the indirect inkjet patterning method. Both inkjet patterning methods are then used in the fabrication of a selective emitter solar cell. Fill factors in the range of 0.79-0.80 are shown to be achievable with both patterning methods, thus indicating the high quality metal-silicon contacts formed by these inkjet techniques.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">patterning</field><field name="subject">inkjet</field><field name="subject">solar cell</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43711</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Bulk density and angle of repose of coal</field><field name="creator">Liu, Chang, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports a study on the effects of size distribution, moisture content and oil addition on bulk density and angle of repose of coal. The experimental work includes four stages. The first stage is to develop reliable experimental techniques. The results confirm that ASTM cubic foot test is reliable for measurement of bulk density and angle of repose if properly operated, although the latter is better measured in a piling process. Stages 2 and 3 are to investigate the effects of size distribution by using -3.55mm% for stage 2 and mean size do.s for stage 3, water content and oil addition on bulk density and angle of repose of coal. For each of them, empirical equations are formulated to predict bulk density and angle of repose. The results indicate that the fraction -3.55mm cutting size in stage 2 does not affect bulk density significantly, while the increase of do.s decreases bulk density to a minimum and then increases. Particle size distribution does not affect angle of repose much. The increase of moisture content decreases bulk density and increases angle of repose significantly. The increase of oil addition increases bulk density while decreases angle of repose significantly. The correlation between bulk density and angle of repose can also be observed: the higher bulk density, the lower angle of repose. There are other variables affecting bulk density and angle of repose. They include oil type, absorption time discharging height and external loading. Their effects on bulk density and angle of repose are quantified in stage 4. The results suggest that, a higher discharging position or larger external loading increase bulk density significantly. Angle of repose decreases when increase the height of discharging position. Diesel oil performed better than waste oil addition in terms of bulk density enhancement. For most of the cases examined, bulk density and angle of repose become stable after ~24 hours oil absorption time.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Coal -- Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Coal -- Density.</field><field name="subject">Carbonization.</field><field name="subject">Particles.</field><field name="subject">Coke-ovens.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of the immune co-receptor function of CD4</field><field name="creator">Maekawa, Akiko, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">CD4 is a co-receptor for binding of T cells to antigen-presenting cells (APC) and the primary receptor for human immunodeficiency virus-I. The disulfide bond in the second extracellular domain (D2) of CD4 is reduced on the cell surface, which leads to formation of disulfide-linked homodimers. A large conformational change must take place in D2 to allow for formation of the disulfide-linked dimer. Domain swapping of D2 is the most likely candidate for the conformational change leading to formation of two disulfide-bonds between Cysl30 in one monomer and Cysl59 in the other one (Cys133 and Cysl62 in the mouse CD4). Thus, we hypothesized that the domain swapping of D2 in CD4 regulates its co-receptor function of antigenspecific T cell activation. We found that mild reduction of the extracellular part of human CD4 resulted in formation of disulfide-linked dimers. We then tested the functional significance of dimer formation for co-receptor function using the engineered Jurkat T cell system by expressing wild-type or disulfide-bond mutant mouse CD4. Eliminating the D2 disulfide bond markedly impaired CD4's coreceptor function as assessed by antigen-specific IL-2 production. Exogenous wild type thioredoxin, but not redox-inactive thioredoxin, could inhibit the CD4-mediated IL-2 production, suggesting that the redox state of D2 disulfide bond is controlled by this oxidoreductase. Furthermore, structural modeling of the complex ofthe T cell receptor and domain-swapped CD4 dimer bound to class II major histocompatibility complex and antigen supports the domain-swapped dimer as the immune co-receptor.  The known involvement of D4 residues Lys318 and Gln344 in dimer formation isalso accommodated by this model. These findings imply that disulfide-linked dimeric CD4 is the preferred functional co-receptor for binding to APC. Strategies to promote      dimerisation of CD4 should, therefore, enhance the immune response, while inhibiting dimer formation is predicted to be immunosuppressive.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular immunity.</field><field name="subject">CD4 antigen.</field><field name="subject">T cells.</field><field name="subject">Host-virus relationships.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into the suitability of various regions sharing a common currency taking explicit account of each economy's size as well as symmetry of shocks</field><field name="creator">Foster, Adrian Nixon, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis builds on the established body of research into the suitability of a country joining other countries in a monetary union by focusing on the potential costs resulting from the loss of monetary policy independence that is a corollary to forming a monetary union. We continue in the tradition of several other authors by extracting supply and demand shocks for a range of countries from VAR analysis and comparing the symmetry of these economic shocks between potential members of a monetary union.  The theoretical contribution of this thesis is that we explicitly incorporate the size of each potential currency union member in the analysis. This contribution is motivated by the observation that a large country would be a more significant part of a given currency union than would a small country. Thus the monetary policy settings of a given currency union would to a larger extent reflect the economic dynamics of a given country the larger that country is relative to the size of the union overall. Previous authors have largely neglected this issue. We explicitly incorporate the size of each potential members' economy in our analytical framework and re-assess the merits of a range of regions forming a currency union.  Using the framework developed, we also inquire into the optimality of current monetary regimes in two regions, the North American continent and in Australia. The first of these is motivated by Mundell's seminal article on currency unions where he asked in largely qualitative terms whether the US and Canada are better currency realms than a hypothetical north south divide of the continent. The second is motivated by the observation that Australia&#146;s economy embodies (economically) very different sub-regions due to the difference importance of commodities production in different parts of the country. We ask whether these different regions experience symmetrical or largely idiosyncratic shocks and find support for the latter.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">VAR analysis</field><field name="subject">Symmetry of shocks</field><field name="subject">Size of economies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On Efficient processing of XML data and their applications</field><field name="creator">Shui,  William Miao, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The development of high-throughput genome sequencing and protein structure determination techniques have provided researchers with a wealth ofbiological data. However, providing an integrated analysis can be difficult due to the incompatibilities of data formats between providers and applications, the strict schema constraints imposed by data providers, and the lack ofinfrastructure for easily accommodating new semantic information.  To address these issues, this thesis first proposes to use Extensible Markup Language (XML) [26] and its supporting query languages as the underlying technology to facilitate a seamless, integrated access to the sum of heterogeneous biological data and services. XML is used due to its semi-structured nature and its ability to easily encapsulate both contextual and semantic information. The tree representation of an XML document enables applications to easily traverse and access data within the document without prior knowledge of its schema.  However, in the process ofconstructing the framework, we have identified a number of issues that are related to the performance ofXML technologies. More specifically, on the performance ofthe XML query processor, the data store and the transformation processor. Hence, this thesis also focuses on finding new solutions to address these issues.  For the XML query processor, we proposes an efficient structural join algorithm that can be implemented on top of existing relational databases. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms previous work in both queries and updates.  For complicated XML query patterns, a new twig join algorithm called CTwigStack is proposed in this thesis. In essence, the new approach only produces and merges partial solution nodes that satisfy the entire twig query pattern tree. Experiments show the proposed algorithm outperforms previous methods in most cases. For more general cases, a propose a mixed mode twig join is proposed, which combines CTwigStack with the existing twig join algorithms and the extensive experimental results have shown the superior effectiveness of both CTwigStack and the mixed mode twig join. By combining with existing system information, the mixed mode twig join can be served as a framework for plan selection during the process of XML query optimization.  For the XML transfonnation component, a novel stand-alone, memory conscious XSLT processor is proposed in this thesis, such that the proposed XSLT processor only requires a single pass of the input XML dataset. Consequently, enabling fast transfonnation of streaming XML data and better handling of complicated XPath selection patterns, including aggregate predicate functions such as the XPath count function.  Ultimately, based on the nature of the proposed framework, we believe that solving the perfonnance issues related to the underlying XML components can subsequently lead to a more robust framework for integrating heterogeneous biological data sources and services.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">XML (Document markup language)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40502</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of recombinant human monoclonal antibodies suitable for blood grouping using antibody engineering techniques</field><field name="creator">Fiddes, Jane L. Sutton, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transfusion medicine is an important part of modern health care and the provision of reliably phenotyped red blood cells (RBC) is essential for safe and effective blood transfusions. For identification of many RBC antigens, monoclonal antibodies of either murine or human origin are available for use in agglutination assays, in which they perform as well as or better than the human polyclonal antibody preparations which they have replaced. However, the detection of some blood groups is still reliant on the use of human polyclonal antisera, which is a less reliable reagent source with respect to availability, batch to batch variation and bio-safety. The use of recombinant antibody and phage display technology for the discovery of new monoclonal antibodies with specificity for some of these RBC antigens has the potential to deliver an economical, unlimited supply of specific antibody reagents suitable for use in RBC phenotyping.  Samples of human B cells from donors producing useful phenotyping antibodies were identified and transformed using Epstein Barr virus into lymphocyte cell lines. Antibody genes were obtained from the cell lines in the form ofRNA which was reverse transcribed, amplified by PCR and cloned into a phagemid vector system to generate several combinatorial antibody libraries. These antibody libraries were displayed on the surface of phage particles and subjected to antigen-driven selection by several rounds of phage display biopanning using soluble and cell based RBC antigens. In addition a large naIve library was biopanned against the same antigens in an attempt to isolate a wide range of antibodies suitable for blood typing.  Several high quality combinatorial antibody libraries with respect to size (&gt; 107 clones) and diversity were generated. Biopanning of recombinant libraries resulted in enrichment of phage antibodies specific for RBC antigens, and several clones were isolated which were shown to be specific for Duffy a antigen. The isolated antibodies would be ideal candidates for re-engineering into multivalent antibody molecules capable of direct agglutination of RBC and as such, have the potential to replace human polyclonal sera in the identification of Duffy a RBC antigen phenotyping.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blood groups.</field><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibodies.</field><field name="subject">Recombinant antibodies.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrochemical behaviours of AB5 metal hydride electrodes with carbon nanotbues additions in Ni-MH batteries</field><field name="creator">Tsai,  Ping-Ju (Ben), Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">AB5 hydrogen storage alloys have been intensively studied due to its superior ability to store hydrogen and release at ambient conditions. It is also a major component in the negative electrode of Ni-MH batteries. However, it has poor high rate capability and cycle life stability. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were found to store a tremendous amount of hydrogen, owing to the fact that they possess very large surface areas. It is because the hydrogen storage capacity is in general highly dependent on the surface area of the storing materials. The aim of this project has been to investigate the effect on electrochemical behaviours of Ab5 negative electrode in Ni-MH batteries by adding carbon nanotubes. The research also studied the influence of the ball milling treatments applied to both the Ab5 and CNTs. La0.59Ce0.27Nd0.08Pr0.06 (Ni0.76Mn0.08Al0.01Co0.15)5 AB5 alloy powder was used as active material in the negative electrode in the Ni-MH batteries, CNTs were used as additive, nickel powers as conductor in a three-electrode cell. Electrodes with compositions of AB5 + x wt.% CNTs (x=0, 5, 10) were studied. Activation, high rate capability and cycle life stability were investigated. The three-electrode cell in an open container with 6 M of KOH as electrolyte was connected to charge/discharge machine where galvanostatically charging and discharging took place. Hydrogenation of ball milled and as-received AB5 alloy powders were examined by conventional volumetric method. Morphology of AB5 and CNTs was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transition electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. The phase identification and crystal lattice parameters were analysed by multi-purpose X-ray diffraction before and after ball milling treatments for both materials. The chemical composition of Ab5 alloy powders was tested using ICP chemical method. The results show the addition of CNTs in negative electrode in a Ni-MH battery enhanced the specific discharge capacity remarkably. A maximum discharge capacity of 252 mAh/g was observed for electrode with low energy ball-milled (LEBM) Ab5 with 5 wt.% of CNTs. This was due to the superior properties and great surface area of CNTs which allow more hydrogen to be stored and diffused onto the surface. Not only CNTs could act as a hydrogen reservoir in the negative electrode, it also acted as a conductor by building a conductive network between active material and nickel powders, and hence an increase in discharge capacity. However, the milling on CNTs alone will not improve the electrochemical properties of the electrode. In contrary, the activation profiles, high rate capability and cycle stability have been enhanced significantly when Ab5 alloy powders were ball-milled. The possible explanation is the smaller particle size and rough surface (and hence large surface area) obtained after ball milling induces a better hydrogen diffusion between the particles, as a result of shorter distance between particles after ball milling.  Ball milling treatments on AB5 alloy powders did not improve the hydrogen absorption capacity. A highest value of 1.27 wt.% was observed for LEBM alloy powders. Ball milled samples have a slightly lower plateau pressure as compared with that of as-received alloy powders. In addition, only 4% of the maximum absorption capacity was lost after 10 repeated absorption and desorption cycles due to pulverisation of the particle over cycling.  It can be concluded that LEBM Ab5 with addition of 5 wt.% CNTs, can significantly improve the electrochemical properties of negative electrode in Ni-MH batteries.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrides.</field><field name="subject">Electrodes, Carbon.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Project housing and the architectural profession in Sydney in the 1960s</field><field name="creator">O'Callaghan, Judith M., Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the emergence of architect-designed project housing in Sydney in the late 1950s and 1960s was associated with a cultural and political shift within the local architectural profession. In order to provide an understanding of how such a shift might be defined, the thesis draws from the literature on the sociology of professions and the theories of sociologists Pierre Bourdieu, Paul du Gay and Sharon Zukin. Beginning in the 1930s and then progressing through the war and postwar years, the thesis will show how the popular housing market came to assume a major point of focus for the local architectural profession not only as an area of practice but also in relation to issues of identity and public image. The emergence of architect-designed project housing in Sydney in the late 1950s and 1960s is seen as an extension of that process. The thesis demonstrates how successful models of architectural engagement with project housing were used to highlight limitations in the way in which the profession had defined itself, particularly through such devices as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects' Code of Professional Conduct. It is argued that the dramatic revision made to that code in 1969 embodied a distinct cultural and political shift for the profession and was the result of a growing tension between traditional ideals and the realities of practice. It is concluded that architect-designed project housing served to inform that shift by providing a context in which aspects of this tension could be tested and, in some cases, reconciled.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Housing -- Sydney.</field><field name="subject">Architecture.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of insulin, peptide YY and the immune system in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Viardot, Alexander, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are associated with insulin resistance and increased levels of inflammation markers, suggesting activation of the immune system. However, the link between this so called ??low-grade inflammation?? and insulin resistance is poorly understood. In this thesis we aimed to investigate the direct effects of insulin on immune cells, and if these effects are changed in the setting of insulin resistance. We showed that insulin has anti-inflammatory effects by shifting T cell differentiation into a T helper type 2 phenotype. This effect was lost in insulin resistant subjects, which resulted in a more pro-inflammatory T helper type 1 cell hyperpolarisation. We also demonstrated that the Th1/2 balance is related to the degree of insulin resistance, and varies accordingly in clinical models of increasing or decreasing insulin resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that in a very early stage of pre-diabetes, where normal glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity are still preserved, we cannot detect any immune activation, but we see a blunted food response of the appetite suppressant hormone PYY. Whilst this could put subjects at risk for further weight gain and development of obesity and T2D, we also demonstrated for the first time that PYY itself has strong anti-inflammatory properties, and that a deficiency in PYY could result in promoting a pro-inflammatory environment. In summary, we could demonstrate strong evidence that both, insulin and PYY are potent anti-inflammatory hormones which modulate immune function, and the observed deficiency in these hormones could contribute to further increase in inflammation and disease progression. Further work is indicated in this area to better understand the sequence and mechanism of immune activation, which may open up new therapeutic avenues for prevention and treatment of T2D.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">Type 2 diabetes</field><field name="subject">Immune system</field><field name="subject">Inflammation</field><field name="subject">PYY</field><field name="subject">T helper cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Glaucoma, a study of neuroprotection using an in vitro model</field><field name="creator">Kalapesi, Freny B., Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Glaucoma is a devastating blinding disease, caused by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss via apoptosis and clinically associated with raised intraocular pressure (IOP). Mainstream theories of glaucoma's pathogenesis detail loss of RGCs via indirect links to lOP; including mechanodistortion of optic nerve axons, trophic factor deficiency, ischaemia or excitotoxicity. A novel concept in the pathogenesis of glaucoma is that pressure alone could be a direct stimulus for RGC loss. Currently available glaucoma treatments are solely aimed at lowering lOP. Reduction ofIOP has been shown to reduce glaucomatous progression however RGC losses continue. Neuroprotection is an emerging field of research offering hope to neurodegenerative diseases, including glaucoma. This thesis investigated known glaucoma therapeutics with suggested neuroprotective activity in an in vitro glaucoma model using the RGC-5 cell line.  To evaluate therapies, a suitable in vitro model was initially evaluated. The RGC-5 cell line was immunochemically demonstrated to possess NSE, a neuronal marker and Thy-1, an RGC marker. Glutamate excitotoxicity was investigated however excessive concentrations were required to cause significant in vitro RGC-5 cytotoxicity. Using a modified hydrostatic pressure model, reproducible pressure-induced RGC-5 apoptosis was demonstrated. Apoptosis was detected using cell morphology and confirmed with both early (caspase-3 and annexin V) and late (TUNEL) apoptotic markers. Despite the advantages of rapid, objective quantification, results indicated that flow cytometry of RGC-5 cells was not technically possible. I defined a modified laser scanning cytometry protocol, allowing for objective apoptosis quantification of TUNEL stained cells.  Brimonidine is postulated to mediate receptor mediated RGC protection. Experiments conducted for this thesis, were the first to immunochemically demonstrate alpha2 adrenergic receptor expression on human RGCs and the RGC-5 cell line, suggesting direct cell mediated protection on the target neuron of glaucoma is possible and that the RGC-5 line is a useful in vitro target for experimentation.  Both brimonidine and betaxolol were shown to confer protection to the RGC-5 cell line from pressure-induced apoptosis, under defined conditions. These results suggest that these drugs may confer direct cell-mediated protection, rather than indirect protection conferred via other retinal or glial cells, the anterior segment, the vasculature or some other means.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Glaucoma.</field><field name="subject">Retinal ganglion cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40509</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Japan's approach to missile defence cooperation from 1993 to 2003 :  examining the structure of cooperation to determine the relative influence of key security objectives</field><field name="creator">Matthews, Aaron, Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The intent of this study is to assess the role of fundamental Japanese security policy objectives in driving the significant shifts in Japan???s approach towards missile defence cooperation with the United States from 1993 to 2003. In studying the relative influence of the objectives that guided Japan???s approach towards missile defence cooperation, this thesis seeks to address a gap in the literature. A debate has occurred over the direction of Japanese security policy that is based on widely different assumptions on the importance attached to various fundamental security objectives. At the same time, Japan???s approach to missile defence has been the subject of considerable analysis that identified the crucial importance of the issue for the attainment of these fundamental security policy objectives. But no linkage has been established between these two levels of analysis. In particular, there has been an absence of assessments of what Japan???s decisions on missile defence cooperation indicate about the relative influence of the various objectives. This thesis developed an analytical framework to enable such an assessment by examining the structure of missile defence cooperation undertaken. Japan possessed a range of options in the level and type of involvement in missile defence cooperation. That involvement would determine the eventual type of benefits and costs incurred against the affected objectives. Cooperation agreed to (or rejected) over the ten year period thereby provides a means to determine the influence of key objectives on Japan???s approach, and in particular those objectives that restrained involvement. The thesis finds that a clear hierarchy existed in the influence of the various objectives on Japan???s approach with changes in their influence explaining the evolution of Japan???s commitment. The desire to strengthen the alliance, weakening domestic political constraints, and disregard of China???s opposition provide the key explanations. These findings not only point towards the respective strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches employed to explain Japanese security policy, but they also suggest the value of greater attention to the state???s ability to overcome domestic constraints in determining policy in order to fully understand the broader transformation of Japanese security policy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan : national security</field><field name="subject">Japan : ballistic missile defenses</field><field name="subject">Japan : military policy</field><field name="subject">Japan : foreign relations with United States</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Distributing points on the sphere: partitions, separation, quadrature and energy</field><field name="creator">Leopardi, Paul Charles Dominic, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis concentrates on a set of problems and approaches relating to the generation and analysis of spherical codes.

Frequent riding of their separate trains by the researcher yielded two very distinct travelling experiences.  Upon enquiry, friends and colleagues readily acknowledged these characteristics- describing the Hankyu area as ??fashionable?? (&#12362;&#12375;&#12419;&#12428;) and ??wealthy?? (&#12362;&#37329;&#25345;&#12385;); whereas the area surrounding the Hanshin line was portrayed as ??noisy?? (&#12395;&#12366;&#12420;&#12363;) and of a place of ??commoners?? (&#24246;&#27665;).  Despite having these perceptions, however, they were uncertain as to their causes. The purpose of this thesis is to research the story behind distinctions in the urban space surrounding two railway lines.  Further, it aims to investigate the extent to which two private railway groups have, through their diversified businesses, contributed in some way to these perceived distinctions.  It is an examination that requires a study of place; particularly one that investigates the locational attributes of the region, like its physical geography, and processes exogenous and endogenous to the two corporations.  The former processes are ones that originated outside the corporations, notably economic and industrial growth and social change.  The latter are ones that originated within the corporations, particularly their management structures, oligopolistic competition, corporate brands, and consumption.  The research draws on various facets of the geographical tradition:  it stems from transport geography to pursue the geography of the city, themes of place-making, and consumption.  Embodied in these are the important subjects of history, culture, corporate behaviour and the economy.  In particular, this thesis considers the popular view which states that transport is a ??permissive factor rather than a direct stimulus?? (Hoyle and Knowles, 1998: 13).  By bringing transport geography in touch with other sub-disciplines, to consider the historical and cultural significance of transport from a contemporary perspective, this thesis concludes that transport can, as in the case of Japanese private urban railways, have a direct influence on place.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">place</field><field name="subject">railways</field><field name="subject">transport geography</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43660</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The cradle of galactic superpowers: studying the natal environment of massive stars</field><field name="creator">Longmore, Steven Neil, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Massive stars play a key role in shaping the local Universe but their formation process remains enigmatic. Emission from the 6.67 GHz, class II masing transition of methanol has proven a powerful tracer of where massive star formation regions are at their earliest evolutionary stages. Presented here are multi-wavelength observations to investigate the molecularlionised gas and (proto) stellar populations in cores traced by methanol maser emission, with the aim of investigating the earliest evolutionary stages of massive star formation and the role of methanol masers as a diagnostic of the state that star formation has reached within a core.  Observations of para-ammonia [NH3 (1,1) --- (5,5)] and 24 GHz continuum emission were taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array towards 21 southern Galactic hot molecular cores traced by 6.7 GHz methanol maser emission. NH3 was detected toward every region. For each core we extract and fit characteristic NH3 spectra and calculate the continuum properties. We split the cores into four groups based on their observed association with NH3 , 24 GHz continuum and methanol maser emission. We find evidence based on the kinetic temperatures and gas kinematics that the cores in the groups are at different evolutionary stages. In addition, we find 24 GHz continuum emission towards some methanol masers which had no 8 GHz continuum counterparts. We posit these could be hyper-compact HII regions: more dense and younger ionised gas than the ultra-compact HII regions. The NH3 (4, 4) and (5, 5) emission is always unresolved and at the methanol maser location, suggesting the methanol masers are located at the warmest part of the core. The fact that several cold cores also contained methanol masers suggests they trace regions at stages shortly after a suitable powering source has formed, right through to relatively evolved UCHII regions. While remaining a good general tracer of young MSF regions, the presence of a methanol maser does not single out any particular evolutionary stage.  High resolution (~0.36"), multiple-filter, mid-IR images using Michelle on Gemini North were taken toward three hot molecular cores signposted by methanol maser emission. We find each region contains multiple, very red, luminous (50-40,000 Leo) sources, some of which lie at extremely small angular separations corresponding to linear separations of ?1700AU. Assuming the MlR point sources are embedded stellar objects, and the observed gas mass provides the bulk of the reservoir from which the stars formed, it is difficult to generate the observed distributions for the most massive cluster members from the gas in the cores using standard forms of the IMF.  Deep, wide-field J, Hand Ks images were taken with IRIS2 on the Anglo Australian Telescope, towards the massive star formation region G305.2+0.2 and combined with 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8.0??m data from the GLIMPSE survey on the Spitzer Space Telescope. After removing contamination from foreground stars, sources were separated, based on their IR colour, to investigate the properties of the embedded stellar populations. While strong extended emission in the GLIMPSE images hampered investigation towards the known sites of massive star formation, a sizable population of IR excess sources are found in the surrounding region free from these completeness effects. Investigation reveals the recent star formation activity in the region is more widespread than previously known. The embedded cluster in the region, G305.24+0.204 may have played a role in triggering further sites of star formation. Finally, we investigate the distribution of IR excess sources towards the cluster, in particular their apparent lack towards the centre compared with its immediate environs.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stars.</field><field name="subject">Cosmology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40570</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of PCI blending on combustion characteristics for iron-making</field><field name="creator">Gill, Trilochan Singh, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The PCI technology is well established for reducing the consumption of economic and environmentally expensive coke in blast furnace iron-making. Often, coal blends show unexpected combustion performance which cannot be explained on the basis of individual coal properties particularly coal rank and volatile matter. Several coals were combusted in this study under controlled conditions in a drop tube furnace. Fixed bed reactor, XRD, SEM and BET analyses were used to understand the mechanism of combustion of coal blends. Burnout of the coal blends did not change linearly with volatile matter of blends. The study demonstrated that combustion behaviour of coal blends was influenced by several properties of individual coals and cannot be estimated by using any single coal parameter. Carbon structure of coal as well as the interaction of volatile matter of individual coals was found to have a strong influence on the burnout of coal blends. Pet-cokes were generally found to burn with a greater difficulty. Carbon structure of pet-cokes was found to have a significant effect on the burnout such that coal blends with highly ordered pet-coke indicated lower burnout. The study shows that up to 10% of pet coke did not change the burnout of PCI blends significantly. As far as combustion is concerned, the drop tube furnace test provides a reasonable distinction of the effect of coal properties for PCI application.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">PCI</field><field name="subject">XRD</field><field name="subject">Blast furnace</field><field name="subject">coal blending</field><field name="subject">DTF</field><field name="subject">SEM</field><field name="subject">BET</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cosmic and solar radiation monitoring of Australian commercial flight crew at high southern latitudes as measured and compared to predictive computer modelling</field><field name="creator">Getley, Ian L., Department of Aviation, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study set out to examine the levels of galactic cosmic radiation exposure to Australian aircrew during routine flight operations, with particular attention to the high southern latitude flights between Australia and South Africa. Latitudes as high as 65?? South were flown to gain the data and are typical of the normal flight routes flown between Sydney and Johannesburg on a daily basis.  In achieving this objective it became evident that suitable commercially available radiation monitoring equipment was not readily available and scientific radiation monitors were sourced from overseas research facilities to compliment my own FH4lB and Liulin monitors provided by UNSW. At the same time it became apparent that several predictive codes had been developed to attempt to model the radiation doses received by aircrew based on flight route, latitudes and altitudes. Further, it became apparent that these codes had not been subjected to verification at high southern latitudes and that they had not been validated for the effects of solar particle events.  Initially measurements were required at the high latitudes followed by mid-latitude data to further balance the PCAIRE code to ensure reasonableness of results for both equatorial and high latitudes. Whilst undertaking this study new scientific monitors became available which provided an opportunity to observe comparative data and results. The Liulin, QDOS and a number of smaller personal dosimeters were subsequently obtained and evaluated. This appears to be the first time that such an extensive cross comparison of these monitors has been conducted over such a wide range of latitudes and altitudes.  During the course of this study a fortuitous encounter with GLE 66 enabled several aspects of code validation to be examined, namely the inability of predictive codes to estimate the increased dose associated with a GLE or the effects of a Forbush decrease on the code results. Finally I review the known biological effects as discussed by numerous authors based on current epidemiological studies, with a view to high-lighting were the advent of future technology in aviation may project aircrew dose levels.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Radiation injuries -- Risk factors.</field><field name="subject">Flight crews -- Health and hygiene.</field><field name="subject">Flight crews -- Health risk assessment.</field><field name="subject">Solar radiation -- Health aspects.</field><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Solar radiation -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Solar radiation -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Solar radiation -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Galactic cosmic rays -- Health aspects.</field><field name="subject">Galactic cosmic rays -- Measurement.</field><field name="subject">Galactic cosmic rays -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Galactic cosmic rays -- Physiological effect.</field><field name="subject">Radiation dosimetry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The development of an in vivo model to study the biology and treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)</field><field name="creator">Liem,  Natalia, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Relapsed ALL remams one of the most common causes of death from disease in children. Broad-range drug resistance is often associated with relapse, although its underlying molecular mechanisms remained poorly understood. The aim of this thesis was to establish an in vivo model using the non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mouse strain, to facilitate the engraftment, expansion and characterisation of childhood ALL cells, obtained from patients at diagnosis or relapse. Mice were inoculated with leukaemia cells from patients' biopsies and engraftment was monitored by the proportion of human CD45+ cells in the blood. Successful leukaemia engraftment was achieved for 20/20 patient biopsies. Continuous passaging of ten xenografts has also been achieved. Immunophenotypic analysis showed only minor changes in cell surface markers after passage in mice. Leukaemia dissemination in murine bone marrow, liver, spleen and blood was consistent with the human disease. The in vivo responses of ten continuous xenografts to dexamethasone and vincristine, but not methotrexate, significantly correlated with patient outcome (p&lt;0.05). Xenograft sub-lines resistant to vincristine, dexamethasone, methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside were also selected by in vivo drug treatments, although these sublines were not found to be cross resistant to structurally unrelated drugs. Resistance to vincristine, either in in vivo selected sub-lines or inherently resistant xenografts, was not associated with increased activity of drug efflux pumps such as P-gp or MRPl. Class I ?? tubulin levels remained unchanged when compared between vincristine resistant sublines and their parental xenografts. Decreased expression of stathmin and increased polymerised tubulin were observed in vincristine resistant sub-lines, suggesting a possible mechanism of counteracting the depolymerising effects of vincristine. In summary, this study has shown that primary ALL cells engraft efficiently into NOD/SCID mice, and indicates that their response to vincristine and dexamethasone mimics the clinical situation. This model appears to be highly relevant for the study of childhood ALL and will provide the foundation to delineate clinically relevant mechanisms of drug resistance.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lymphoblastic leukemia in children.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cytoreductive surgery and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy for peritoneal surface malignancy</field><field name="creator">Yan, Tristan Dongbo, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past, patients with peritoneal surface malignancy were considered incurable and were only offered palliative treatments. However, in a substantial number of patients, disease progression that is isolated to peritoneum may occur. It has been realised that elimination of peritoneal surface tumours may have an impact on the survival of these cancer patients, in whom a prominent cause of death is peritoneal carcinomatosis. The focus of this PhD. thesis is on the combined treatment of cytoreductive surgery and perioperative intrapersonal chemotherapy for diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma, pseudomyxoma peritonei, colorectal peritoneal carcinomatosis and resectable gastric cancer. Section one describes the major principles of management for peritoneal surface malignancy, covering the historical perspectives, the treatment rationales and the learning curve associated with the combined procedure. Section two is devoted to peritoneal mesothelioma, in trying to examine this disease from its clinical, radiologic and histopathologic aspects. A radiologic classification and a histopathologic staging system for this disease are proposed. In section three, the results of the combined treatment for pseudomyxoma peritonei are presented, including a systematic review of the literature, a case series of 50 patients from our Australian centre and a treatment failure analysis of 402 patients from the Washington Cancer Institute.  These studies suggest that a disease-free state is important for long-term survival for patients with pseudomyxoma peritonei. In section four, the current evidence on the combined treatment for colorectaI peritoneal carcinomatosis is demonstrated by conducting a systematic review of the literature and survival and perioperative outcome analyses of two separate patient cohorts. These results suggest that the combined treatment is associated with an improved survival, as compared with historical controls. In the last section, a metaanalysis of the randomised controlled trials on adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for resectable gastric cancer shows that a significant improvement in survival is associated with hyperthermic intraoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy alone or in combination with early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) -- Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Peritoneum -- Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Peritoneum -- Cancer -- Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Colon (Anatomy) -- Cancer -- Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Rectum -- Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Rectum -- Cancer -- Surgery.</field><field name="subject">Stomach -- Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Combined modality therapy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of floc microstructure and shear on dewatering processes</field><field name="creator">Khan, Konika Moushumi, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigated the effect of floc microstructure (size and fractal structure) and shear forces on dewatering processes, which are crucial for environmental and economical aspects in many industries.  Due to limitations inherent In experimental investigations, a numerical code using the discrete element method and including some novel force models (polymer bridging force, elastic bending moment and a modified concept of rolling friction torque) was developed to simulate the consolidation behavior of flocculated systems. The code showed good agreement with experimental results.  The elastic behavior of aggregates is known to depend on the backbone structure (stress bearing structure of the aggregate). However, there is little known about backbone structure. It was found that backbone represents a fractal structure with a fractal dimension value close to 1 and increasing with increase of aggregate mass fractal dimension.  The dewatering process was characterized by compressive and hindered settling behavior. The numerical study of compressive rheology with different aggregate microstructure showed that the compaction results from a reduction of the correlation length rather than increase in fractal dimension. The compressive behavior is consistent with theoretical models at higher compressive stresses but is not well described at low compressive stresses. A semi- empirical model is presented describing the compressive rheology in both regions via a correction factor derived using dimensional analysis. The hindered settling  behavior was in good agreement with the theoretical model based on the assumption of self similar structure.  The investigation revealed that shear effect is not due entirely to hydrodynamics and can arise from the particle bonding mechanism alone. The study showed that low shear increases compressibility but high shear is detrimental. At low shear, bond bending at local voids results in solid densification. High shear increases kinetic energy and kinetic repulsion of the particles. The effect of shear is analogous to the anomalous behavior of the water density- temperature function. At low temperature bond breakage increases the density and at high temperature thermal expansion decreases the density. The investigation showed that shear increases the permeability due to bending of the structure in the shear direction, resulting in large pores.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sewage sludge -- Dewatering.</field><field name="subject">Shear flow.</field><field name="subject">Flocculation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40547</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behaviour of steel and steel-concrete composite beams and beam-to-column connetions at elevated temperatures</field><field name="creator">Heidarpour, Amin, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The current research work investigates the behaviour of steel and composite beams as well as beam-to-column connections at elevated temperatures. Significant attention is needed to identify the main issues. as the behaviour is profoundly different from that at ambient temperature. Local buckling of the beam flange outstands has been found to be highly significant in accelerating the development of catenary action in fire, since this action is reliant on hinges forming which may result from local buckling.  Local buckling of the beam web, which experiences a non-uniform temperature variation, is also important because the mechanical properties of the steel are degraded non-uniformly from their ambient values. Current formulations for web buckling at ambient temperature therefore need substantial revision at elevated temperatures. Very large compressive forces are developed within the beams initially and these induce large stresses in the column web; hitherto this has not been considered. Developing a formulation representing the mechanics of this potential failure zone in the column web in the compression region of the connection is a useful and needed addition to research in the topic. Predicting the critical temperature in a connection that causes failure of the bolts, end plate and column flange in the tension zone of the connection is considered in this research work. An elastic analysis of a panel zone in a rigid or semi-rigid joint in a steel frame, which is based on simple equilibrium considerations that takes into account the shear and flexural deformations of the panel zone, is developed at elevated temperatures.  In order to model the structural response of a composite beam restrained by cooler members in a steel compartment fire in a frame structure at elevated temperature, recourse is needed to a geometric nonlinear formulation, since the beam transverse deflections are not negligible and the axial eompressive force in the member is also substantial at the early stages of the fire. This thesis presents such a formulation, which incorporates partial interaction between the concrete slab and steel component, as well as the degradation of the stiffnesses of the components of the composite beam prior to yield at elevated temperature.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Steel -- Structural.</field><field name="subject">Steel.</field><field name="subject">Composite construction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The molecular mechanism of tissue factor activation</field><field name="creator">Chen, Vivien Mun Yee, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tissue factor (TF) is the essential cofactor for FVIIa. Binding to transmembrane tissue factor increases the catalytic efficiency of FVIIa allowing activation of FX and FIX which initiates coagulation and propagates stable clot. Transmembrane TF resides in a cryptic configuration on the cell surface and in the circulation with low procoagulant activity. However TF can be rapidly switched to an active configuration in order to contribute to thrombus propagation. The precise nature of this switch is unknown, however it is known to be an extracellular event.  The extracellular part of TF consists of 2 fibronectin type III domains. The disulfidebond in the membrane proximal domain (Cys186-Cys209) is a cross-strand bond which links adjacent strands in the same ?? sheet. It has the configuration, characteristic dihedral strain energy and bond length of an allosteric disulfide bond. This indicates that it has the potential to undergo thiol/disulfide exchange to change the function of the TF protein. We confirm that the integrity of the Cys186-Cys209 disulfide is required for coagulant function and that tissue factor contains free thiols in the cryptic state which are lost when TF becomes de-encrypted.  Membrane based tissue factor procoagulant activity is blocked by the mono-thiol alkylators N-ethylmaleimide and methyl methanethiosulfonate; but increased by ECl/formation of the disulfide via the thiol oxidiser, HgCb or thiol cross-linkers, eimidohexane and bismalemidoethane. The increase in activity correlates with a conformation change in the TF protein adjacent to the disulfide. We show that redox active protein disulfide isomerase is associated with cryptic tissue factor and propose that the cryptic conformation of tissue factor is maintained through formation of an Snitrosylated complex with protein disulfide isomerase.  Our results indicate that the activation of TF involves a change of conformation of the domain 2 of TF caused by formation of the cross-strand Cys186-Cys209 disulfide bond. We suggest that this is likely to be the physiological change that facilitates productive binding of FIX and FX in coagulation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thromboplastin.</field><field name="subject">Activation (Chemistry)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40556</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A tale of two surveys: searching for extrasolar planets from Australia and Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Christiansen, Jessie Leigh, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The transit method of detecting extrasolar planets relies on the small periodic changes in the brightness of the planet's host star as the planet orbits between the observer and the star. Transiting planets are extremely useful discoveries due to the significant gain in information that can be obtained on the planet and its host star than extrasolar planets discovered with other methods. The field of transiting planets has matured rapidly in the last 5 years, particularly in the area of wide-field surveys. This thesis describes the results of two such surveys.  The Vulcan South Antarctic Planet Finder was designed to exploit the conditions at the South Pole, which are ideal for a transit survey. Several hardware failures resulted in the acquisition of only a small amount of corrupted data on a single field.  The University of New South Wales Extrasolar Planet Search is an ongoing transit survey using the 0.5-m Automated Patrol Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia. 25 fields were observed for 1-4 months each between 2004 October and 2007 May. Light curves were constructed for ~87,000 stars down to I= 14th magnitude, and from these 23 planet candidates were identified. Ten candidates were eliminated using higher spatial resolution archived images and online catalogue data. Eight were followed up with higher spatial resolution imaging and/or medium resolution spectroscopy and were determined to be eclipsing binaries. Five candidates remain that require additional observation to determine their nature. No planets have been confirmed in this data set thus far.  The large sets of high precision light curves generated by transit surveys hold significant potential for additional data-mining. To demonstrate this, a variable star catalogue was compiled from the full data set. A total of 850 variable stars were identified, with 659 new discoveries. In the course of compiling this catalogue, the first example of a high-amplitude &#948; Scuti star in an eclipsing binary was identified. This represented the first opportunity for a dynamical mass measurement of a highamplitude &#948; Scuti star, and the system was studied comprehensively.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Extrasolar planets -- Detection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The computational fluid dynamics analysis and optimisation of process vessels used in the manufacture of military propellants and high explosives</field><field name="creator">Lea, Jimmy, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research focuses on the computational fluid dynamics modelling and simulation of the existing reactors and mixing tanks employed by the Australian Defence Industries to manufacture military propellants for gun projectiles and small rockets; high explosives for naval gun projectiles and aerial bombs. The main objective of this research is to gain a thorough understanding of these process vessels via research and to provide recommendations to improve their performance. Reactors and mixing tanks were chosen as the test unit operations because although they contribute significantly to the manufacturing process, reactors have frequently been poorly understood or in the case of mixing tanks, taken for granted. Consequently, there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge to support successful operations of these process vessels. In addition, this research also recommends using photocatalysis technology to destroy liquid wastes produced from such manufacturing activities.  For each product, a full characterisation was provided that included detailed theoretical analyses that presents a unique insight into the hydrodynamics occurring in these process vessels. The credibility of theoretical predictions was demonstrated via qualitative and quantitative validation using particle image velocimetry. Results from characterisation showed that the reactors and mixing tanks employed in the manufacture of military propellants, high explosives or aerial bombs were operating at sub-optimum conditions. To tackle this shortcoming, four ideal geometrical configurations that promised optimum performance were proposed for each of the test studies. These included a designer reactor for the manufacture of military propellants and effective mixing tanks for suspending high explosive particles, blending different high explosives and for manufacturing aerial bombs. The correct implementation of these recommendations will provide an optimum operation that achieves high product throughput and concurrently reduces reject rate.  Research was also conducted to formulate a set of multipurpose design guidelines for a suspension mixing tank. The design template created from the results will provide valuable information to researchers across industries in their quest to optimise any unit suspension mixing tank operated on the principle of mechanical agitation. Finally, modelling of reactive species was conducted on a laboratory-scale photoreactor, involving physical experiments to destroy toxic effluent aqueous phase.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Explosives.</field><field name="subject">Fluid dynamics -- Computer simulation.</field><field name="subject">Propellants.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40560</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Government store is open for business: A review of the Commisariat in Colonia NSW 1788-1835</field><field name="creator">Beckett, Gordon W, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The commissariat was the main economic drivers in the colonial economy between 1788 and 1835.

It traverses Australian women's struggle for equal pay and pay equity from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginnings of the twenty-first. It recounts and analyses women's activism through campaigns targeting state and federal politicians, prime ministers, premiers and state and federal ministers for labour and industrial relations; engagement in the industrial arena; and through women's organisations and work with the trade union movement.  The thesis analyses achievements and setbacks through the federal industrial arena, and references, too, major state industrial cases and legislation. It analyses women's intervention and impact in the Equal Pay, Minimum Wage, Basic Wage and National Wage Cases. Through archives, original letters, articles, pamphlets, books, interviews and other sources, the thesis recounts women's agreements and disagreements on how the struggle would be won, and the solid campaigning in which women engaged from the late years of the nineteenth century, through every decade of the twentieth, and in the first years of the first decade of the twenty-first century. It covers a span of over one hundred years, during which the claim was characterised as one for equal pay, the rate for the job and, more recently, pay equity.  Looking at the past and the present, the thesis concludes that women's direct engagement with the industrial system and parallel working within women's organisations and trade unions has been central to gains in equal pay and pay equity. Apart from women's and men's earnings in Scandinavia, relativities between women's and men's wages and salaries in Australia have been -- despite the disparity - the most approximate of all OECD countries. The thesis posits that it is only with a return to centralised wage fixing, with women's organisations intervening and bringing their own experts to educate industrial commissions, employers and unions, that the value of women's work will be recognised as equal to the value of men's work, and equal pay, the rate for the job, or pay equity will be achieved.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wages -- Women -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Equal pay for equal work -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40563</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The performances of a psychic privacy: waiting for the real miles Franklin</field><field name="creator">Knowles, Sandra, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current scholarship on Miles Franklin emphasises the gaps and contradictions of a secretive and mysterious author. The eagerly awaited release of her private papers was marked by Paul Brunton's 2004 publication of her diaries, an edition that has been conceived and understood as a revelation of "the real Miles Franklin" (Lecture Title, State Library). This thesis disrupts the concept of a "real" Franklin by arguing that these diaries, in their manuscript form, give us more delay. Foregrounding the performative guises of the private diary subject, this thesis establishes that we are, and will always be, waiting for the real Miles Franklin to arrive.  The insights of diary and textual theories illuminate Franklin, I will argue, as one who seeks the proliferative creativity of the anonymous author, and who would use her diary writing to escape definition within public discourse. Yet the tension between creativity and the daily enables us to see how potential is distorted into waiting in the surrogate space of these diaries, as Franklin seeks protection within the nostalgia of a national past and an Edenic vision of the future. This vantage point directs us to identify, as will be seen, the vulnerabilities and instabilities of this space for Franklin, as it implicates her in the dilemma of her times. In this way, we can ascertain how she holds the line as a "spotless virgin" (3 May 1942) in her resistance to the gender performances of new women, her refusal to be defined as one thing or another. This resistance to imitation will also be analysed as it plays out via the curse of Franklin's self-repetition in an Australia that waits, disrupting her attempts to achieve anonymity as the embodiment of a national literary tradition.  In her avoidance of being a private text to be read, Franklin promotes herself, I will contend, as a "world classic" (Franklin Furphy 3) author of and in these diaries, resisting the transition from the readerly to the modernist writerly text at a time of artistic revolution (Barthes S/Z 4). In illuminating Franklin's exposure to these very vulnerabilities as a subject-in-process, in a document intended for posthumous publication, this thesis will establish that she has made a courageous contribution to the complexities of a particular moment within Australian modernity</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Franklin, Miles, 1879-1954 -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Diary fiction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40564</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Model studies of solid flow and size segregation in packed and moving beds</field><field name="creator">Wu , Shimin, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work examines the fundamental behaviour of granular materials in packed/moving beds under simplified blast furnace conditions. Such study has a significant impact on the development of new technology such as pulverized coal injection and the performance of blast furnace operation.  Experiments have shown that a number of interesting phenomena appear in blast furnace operation. These phenomena involve rich granular dynamics which currently attract strong interest from a wide scientific and engineering. However, previous work on this area, limited by the research techniques, is predominantly at large scales focusing on phenomenological descriptions, but rarely touching on the basic fundamentals governing these phenomena. A novel discrete element simulation at an individual particle level can overcome these problems. For this purpose, this work conducts a systematic study of these important phenomena, including crater formation, coke collapse, creep motion and particle percolation, by use of the discrete element method (DEM).  The experiments and simulations conducted in the impact of a particle stream onto a particle bed using a 20 slot model suggest that the DEM can reproduce the experimental results well under comparative conditions. The crater size is shown to be affected by the discharging rate, discharging height and materials properties, and is related to the ratio of the input energy from the falling stream to the inertial energy from the original packing. Fundamental understanding of coke collapse based on three different configurations: batch charging, self loading and load impact have been investigated. It was found that coke collapse is a kind of continuous avalanche due to top layer particles spreading. Apparent frozen layer under rapidly flowing layer is not stationary and slowly creep motion can be detected at an arbitrary depth. The mean velocity of creep motion decays exponentially with depth. Percolation happens due to both gravity and strain. The percolation velocity under gravity is much greater than that under shear. Size ratio effect is most significant. For size ratio smaller than threshold gravity induced percolation dominate otherwise shear due to the descending of the packed bed.  Additionally, this work demonstrates the value of DEM as a tool for complementing experimental observations.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">segregation.</field><field name="subject">Beds.</field><field name="subject">Granular materials -- Flow.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The empowerment of aggressive state ideology in two periods of Russian history</field><field name="creator">Urs,  Ion, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The concepts of power and state - particularly embedded in the idea of the Great Power, with a geopolitical perspective and a profoundly aggressive character - are tantamount in importance to the Russia's elite political ideology. However, the existence of different emphases within such a political ideology, ranging from the active-obstructive to the passive stances, brings into question the factors of variation that might be responsible for the elite's level of determination to pursue these concepts over an internal or foreign policy development.  In addressing this query, two tasks are set: descriptive - involving a survey of the content of Russian aggressive political ideology over different periods in history; and explanatory - determining circumstances that might account for the empowerment of one or other option of Russian aggressive political ideology. Therefore, the thesis includes a comparison of historical periods with similar relevance to the Russian state. The concern here is in relation to shifting factors of variations of aggressive political ideology acting in the space-frame of one state, but in different time-frame. Resting on these frames the thesis explores the shaping of the Russian elite's defining principles of state internal and foreign policy development and traces the factors of variation responsible for the empowerment of one or other particular form of the aggressive political ideology.  The factors of variation discussed in the thesis are different in nature and intensity. The primary impetus for variation in the form that aggressive political ideology would take is determined by the factor of national distress. Other factors (regime volatility, political and economic motivations, information dissemination, and challenges within the international system) are responsible for the depth and extent to which aggressive ideology is going to resonate. No factor could create the variation by itself. The argument is that a specific set of factors is required to create the conditions for variations in the form the aggressive political ideology would take and to determine whether aggressive ideology would generate or not an obstructive political decision.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Russia (Federation) -- Politics and government 1991-.</field><field name="subject">Ideology -- Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Ideology -- Political aspects -- Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Political culture -- Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Power (Social sciences) -- Russia (Federation)</field><field name="subject">Elite (Social sciences) -- Russia (Federation)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40568</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Numerical and Experimental Investigation of High-Speed Liquid Jets - Their Characteristics and Dynamics.</field><field name="creator">Zakrzewski, Sam, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A comprehensive understanding of high-speed liquid jets is required for their introduction into engine and combustion applications. Their transient nature, short lifetime, unique characteristics and the inability to take many experimental readings, has inhibited this need. This study investigates the outflow of a high-speed liquid jet into quiescent atmospheric air. The key characteristics present are, a bow shock wave preceding the jet head, an enhanced mixing layer and the transient deformation of the liquid jet core. The outflow regime is studied in an experimental and numerical manner.  In the experimental investigation, a high-speed liquid water jet is generated using the momentum exchange by impact method. The jet velocity is supersonic with respect to the impinged gaseous medium. The resulting jet speed is Mach 1.8. The jet is visualised with the use of shadowgraph apparatus. Visualisation takes place over a variety of time steps in the liquid jet???s life span and illustrates the four major development stages. The stages progress from initial rapid core jet expansion to jet stabilisation and characteristic uniform gradient formation. The visualisation shows that at all stages of the jet???s life it is axi-symmetric. One dimensional nozzle analysis and a clean bow shock wave indicate that the pulsing jet phenomenon can be ignored.  In the numerical investigation, a time marching finite volume scheme is employed. The bow shock wave characteristics are studied with the use of a blunt body analogy. The jet at a specific time frame is considered a solid body. The jet shape is found to have an important influence on the shock position and shape. Analysis of the results indicates a shock stand-off similar to that seen in experimental observations and the prediction of shock data.  The jet life span is modelled using a species dependent density model. The transient calculations reproduce the key jet shape characteristics shown in experimental visualisation. The mushrooming effect and large mixing layer are shown to develop. These effects are strongest when the shock wave transience has yet to stabilise. Quantitative analysis of the mixing layer at varying time steps is presented.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high-speed liquid jet</field><field name="subject">bow shock wave</field><field name="subject">shadowgraph</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics (CFD).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18653</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical evalution of the time-series relation between price and accounting based value in imperfect markets</field><field name="creator">Curtis, Asher, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">I examine the extent to which accounting information is reflected in market prices at different points in time. The efficient market hypothesis implies that price always reflects (value-relevant) accounting information, based on the assumptions of rational investors and costless arbitrage. I examine the time-series relation between price and value in two studies which are motivated by potential shortcomings of these assumptions. First, there is significant debate regarding the rationality of equity investors during the late 1990s. I therefore contrast the historical time-series relation between price and value with that of the 1990s, and show that the historical tendency of price to converge towards value breaks down during this period. Second, I examine the impact of the lack of close substitutes - an arbitrage cost - on the time-series relation between price and value. I find some evidence of a positive association between this arbitrage cost and both the level and the duration of the disparity between price and value. My results provide empirical support for the hypothesis that price requires time to reflect (accounting) information and has implications for research that assumes that prices are measured without error.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Value.</field><field name="subject">Time-series analysis.</field><field name="subject">Prices.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40594</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epidemiology, microbiology, outcomes and trends in keratitis in Queensland 1999-2004</field><field name="creator">Green, Matthew, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">AIMS 1. To establish the patient demographics, risk factors, causative organisms, levels of antibiotic resistance, clinical presentations and treatment patterns of keratitis at a tertiary referral hospital in Australia. 2. To establish any change in these factors over 5 years. 3. Establish the factors associated with poor outcomes.  METHODS: A retrospective audit of all patients who had a corneal culture in 5 years was conducted. Patients' clinical information was gathered from medical records and smear, culture and antibiotic resistance results were gathered from the local microbiology database. Associations between risk factors for keratitis and patient variables were analysed statistically. Outcome of a patient's episode of keratitis was classified as poor using final criteria. Trends over time in variables were analysed using linear regression.  RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty-three (253) corneal cultures of 231 patients were included. Sixty percent (60%) of patients were male and there was a bimodal distribution in the age of presentation. Common risk factors for keratitis were contact lens wear (22%), ocular surface disease (18%), ocular trauma (16%) and prior ocular surgery (11 %). Corneal cultures were positive in 65% of cases and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (27%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), Staphylococcus aureus (12%) and fungi (7%) were recovered. There was significant variation in the monthly recovery of P. aeruginosa (p=0.04) and fungi (p=0.02) which were more frequent in summer months, while Streptococcus pneumonia (p=0.04) was more common in winter months. Antibiotic resistance of cultured bacteria to cephalothin increased significantly (2% to 12%; p=0.02). Final vision of 6/12 or better was found in 48% (100) of cases while a poor outcome was seen in 28% (58) of cases. Multivariate analysis showed that the relative risk of a patient having a poor outcome was 4.3x (confidence interval [Cl] 2.0 to 9.5) if they had severe keratitis, 4.1 x (Cl 1.8 to 9.5) if they had keratitis related to ocular surface disease and 3.8x (Cl 1.8 to 8.3) if they were over 50 years old.  CONCLUSIONS 1. In this series the most common risk factor for keratitis was contact lens wear and the most commonly isolated organism was P. aeruginosa which had seasonal variation in rate of recovery. 2. Keratitis related to contact lens wear became more frequent while keratitis related to prior ocular surgery became less frequent. 3. A poor outcome is more likely in patients with severe keratitis, keratitis related to prior ocular surface disease or older age.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbiology.</field><field name="subject">Keratitis.</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology.</field><field name="subject">Contact lenses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of transcription factor c-jun in acute inflammation and intimal thickening in bypassed vein grafts: insights using DNAzymes</field><field name="creator">Waldman, Alla, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atherosclerosis 'is a key pathological process underlying the development and progression of three major diseases of the vascular system- coronary artery disease, cerebro-vascular and peripheral vascular disease. Chronic vascular wall inflammation is considered as a principal cause in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Intimal thickening that develops in arteries and veins as an adaptive response to an injury has many similarities with atherosclerosis, but at the same time represents a unique pathological entity. This Thesis explores the utility of applying a novel DNAzyme based approach that targets "master-regulator" transcription factors c-jun and Egr-1 to in vivo and in vitro models of acute inflammation and intimal thickening. Studies included in this Thesis reveal that transcription factor c-jun plays a, key regulatory role in controlling leucocyte movement during an acute inflammation induced by IL-1 f3 through regulation of the expression of adhesion molecules ICAM, VCAM-1, E-selectin and VE-cadherin. Similarly, by applying ED5, a DNAzyme that targets transcription factor Egr-1 to the rat model of mesenteric microcirculation I demonstrate that Egr-1 controls leucocyte movement during an acute inflammation as evidenced by almost complete inhibition of leucocyte flux, adhesion and extravasation by ED5. The rabbit model of bypass grafting shows that Dz13 (a DNAzyme targeting transcription factor c-jun) significantly reduces intimal thickening in bypassed vein grafts of chow-fed animals at 28 days in vivo and in culture-grown human saphenous veins in vitro.  Taken together these findings suggest that a DNAzyme based approach of targeting transcription factor c-jun has the potential to be used as a modulator of the acute inflammatory response and of intimal thickening formation.

This requires the capability of better understanding the clients' facility needs and requirements, which ultimately means that Facilities Managers must learn about the nature of clients' organisations and their organisational cultures. This study contends that in a project it is the briefing process that provides the greatest opportunity for cultural learning to occur, a process wherein it is important for the actors to converge upon shared understanding of facility needs and requirements. By focusing on culture at a cognitive rather than a behavioural level, this study has specifically attempted to identify the types of knowledge learned during a briefing process, to explore the process of cultural learning and the factors that encourage or impede such learning, and to produce an insight into the process.  A hospital partnering project was adopted as a case study for investigating the process of cultural learning during the briefing process. Using Nonaka's (1994) theory of Knowledge Creation, this study portrays the briefing process as one wherein the social processes during briefing facilitate the conversion of tacit and explicit knowledge in a cyclical way. Sackmann's (1991) categorisation of knowledge has been used to analyse the social interactions during briefing by dissecting the different levels of knowledge being shared. In support of the cognitive perspective of learning and the conceptual understanding of culture as mindsets or cognitions, Laukkanen's (1996) Comparative Cause Mapping method was used to measure the cultural learning occurring among members of both the FM and their clients' groups, using an in-depth inquiry into five key concepts during the briefing process. Data was collected longitudinally during the briefing process using real-time observations and semi-structured interviews which maximised the comparative measures of similarities and differences in the Cause Maps depicting cultural learning.  This integration of culture, learning, and briefing theories usmg Nonaka's (1994) knowledge creation theory, Sackmann's (1991) categorisation of knowledge, and Laukkanen's (1996) Comparative Cause Mapping method has produced interesting and useful insights into the process of cultural learning during the briefing process within a hospital partnering project. The study has found that significant cultural learning did take place during the briefing process and that partnering projects can present opportunities for this to occur. In particular, it is established that cultural learning is best conceived of as a process of social construction in which individuals, subgroups and groups engage in a collective approach to understanding facility needs and requirements. More specifically, briefing meetings were found to represent contexts for social interactions in which cultural learning took place. This learning occurred in constantly negotiated boundaries and through conflicts and disagreements, with actors competing in a dynamic process of social construction to have their version of understanding of the clients' needs and requirements prevail. The diverse client groups within the hospital context being studied provided a management opportunity for Facility Managers to act as 'mediators', which facilitated cultural learning. Finally, FM technical knowledge was shown to be an important tool for the FM group during the process of cultural learning as the participants negotiated their versions of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Culture.</field><field name="subject">Facility management.</field><field name="subject">Hospitals.</field><field name="subject">Learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40597</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation and mathematical modelling of human cardiovascular system during exercise</field><field name="creator">Wang, Lu, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The hypothesis in this dissertation is that the mathematical and physiological models can be developed to estimate cardiac output and metabolic demand of exercising individual from simple non-invasive physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiration, working rate and body movement (using multiple triaxial accelerometers). The models developed could be incorporated as part of a closed loop control system for cardiac pacemaker and/or heart assist devices.  A reliable measurement system has been developed to measure cardiac output, heart rate, body movement and respiratory variables and to process and analyze the data coming from the measurements. Analyzing, designing and modelling of the measurement system have also been conducted. The foremost is to model the mixing chamber based gas measurement system and the other is to analyze and compensate the orientation error of triaxial accelerometers on the assessment of energy expenditure.  Two mathematical models and one physiological model have been developed in the current research. The first mathematical model is to estimate steady state energy expenditure using a nonlinear regression method from the outputs of triaxial accelerometers. Results show that the proposed nonlinear model is better than both the traditional linear models and the earlier nonlinear models. The second mathematical model emphasizes on investigating the key central cardiovascular response to the steady state of incremental exercise. The modeling results show that all the studied cardiovascular parameters response to exercise nonlinearly except heart rate which responses to exercise linearly. Furthermore, based on a previous model developed in the Biomedical Systems Laboratories in UNSW and the reliable experimental data, a physiological model has been established to successfully estimate both the cardiac output and the metabolic demand with heart rate and workload as its input.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Cardiovascular system -- Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40598</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The genetic basis of veno-occlusive disease with immunodeficiency syndrome</field><field name="creator">Roscioli, Tony, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses the genetic basis of a rare autosomal recessive primary immunodeficiency disorder with the characteristic additional feature of venoocclusive disease of the liver (VODI). The interest in this condition was stimulated both by the potential to identify the genetic basis of a rare immunodeficiency and the opportunity to gain an insight into the biological basis of hepatic veno-occlusive disease, a poorly understood condition that is encountered most frequently in Australia as a consequence of bone marrow transplantation.  The gene responsible for VODI was identified by homozygosity mapping and DNA sequence analysis of positional candidates and was shown to be the PML Nuclear Body expressed protein Sp110. This is the first time a PML Nuclear Body protein has been shown to be involved in immunodeficiency disorder. Subsequent immunofluorescence studies of affected patient cell lines showed absence of Sp110 in patient B cells.  The role of SP110 alleles in the susceptibility of bone marrow transplant patients to hepatic veno-occlusive disease was investigated using a cohort of patients from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle. A SNP association study identified initial evidence for an association, but the study lacked sufficient power after correction for multiple testing.  Contemporaneously, Dr Igor Kramnik published a report that the murine homologue of Sp110, Ifi75 (also termed Ipr1) was deleted in mice that were supersusceptible to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A further SNP association study was therefore performed utilising a NSW cohort of Mantouxpositive South East Asian migrants, which detected evidence that alleles of SP110 may be associated with progression of M. tuberculosis infection. Again, the limited size of this cohort precluded definitive findings.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liver -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Bood vessels -- Diseases -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Bood vessels -- Diseases -- Immunological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Diseases -- Immunological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Liver -- Immunology.</field><field name="subject">Immunological deficiency syndromes -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="subject">Autoimmune diseases -- Genetic aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40599</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Meaning, agency, and corporeal identity: "simultaneity" as a condition of Butler's performativity and Merleau-Ponty's bodily interntionality</field><field name="creator">Gearside, Anne Louise, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines Judith Butler's account of performative agency in relation to its critics, in particular, the question of whether Butler's thesis disavows materiality and thereby agency.

I identify this common ground through the institution of the concept "simultaneity" to express a relationship of reciprocity between meaning and materiality through which ontological and epistemological significance is, reciprocally, sedimented and transformed; stabilised and destabilised.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Merleau-Ponty, Maurice, 1908-1961 -- Criticism and interpretation.</field><field name="subject">Agency.</field><field name="subject">Butler, Judith.</field><field name="subject">Meaning (Philosophy)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Energy price modelling and risk management</field><field name="creator">Kwok,  Ho King Calvin, Actuarial Studies, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the development of a forecasting model for short- to medium-term electricity spot prices, based on modelling the dynamics of the supply and demand functions. It is found that the equilibrium assumption frequently adopted in electricity price models does not always hold; to overcome this problem, a notional demand process derived from the market clearing condition is proposed. Not only is this demand process able to capture all the price-affecting factors in one variable, but it also allows the equilibrium assumption to be satisfied and a spot price model to be built, using any appropriate form of hypothetical supply function. In addition, this thesis presents a model for approximating and modelling the bid stacks by capturing the points that govern their shape and location. Integrating these two models provides a realistic model that has a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 19% and 24% for week- and month-ahead forecasts respectively, when applied to the New South Wales (NSW) half-hourly electricity spot prices. Additionally, the density forecasting evaluation method proposed by Diebold et al. (1998) is employed in the thesis to assess the performance of the model.  Besides the development of a spot price model, a two-part empirical study is made of the prices of NSW electricity futures contracts. The first part of the study develops a method based on the principle of certainty equivalence, which enables the market utility function to be recovered from a set of futures market quotes. The method is tested with two different sets of simulated data and works as expected.  However, it is unable to obtain useful results from the NSW market quotes due to the poor data quality. The second part uses a regression method to investigate the relationship between futures prices and the descriptive statistics of the underlying spot prices. The result suggests that futures prices in NSW are linear combinations of the median and volatility of the final payoff.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric utilities -- Rates -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Risk management.</field><field name="subject">Prices -- Australia -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40602</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Jamii, social ties and networks: managing HIV and infant feeding in Central Tanzania</field><field name="creator">Burke, Jean Robinson, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Tanzania where HIV transmission is high, decisions to avoid or modify breastfeeding are crucial for infant survival yet difficult due to competing risks. This thesis explores the attitudes towards HIV and infant feeding of mothers and significant members of their social networks in Central Tanzania. It seeks to understand the perceived and potential role of social dynamics in infant feeding decisions to prevent HIV. Qualitative data was collected from in-depth interviews with twenty key informants, six HIV-positive mothers and four relatives of HIV-infected mothers. Thirteen focus group discussions were conducted in one urban and three village sites in the Dodoma region with mothers, fathers, grandparents, traditional midwives and healers, village leaders and people living with HIV. This process was adapted to benefit and maximise participation of respondents and people with HIV. Data was analysed using grounded theory and natural Swahili language. Cases of HIV-positive mothers and their close networks are used to explore the findings. Social graphs visually map and communicate the complex social context around infant feeding in new ways. Emerging themes based on Swahili categorisations provide original conceptualising of how social relations (jamii) are involved in decision-making. In the context of HIV, infant feeding is a moral issue of fear and safety (salama): decisions seek to maximise kinga (immunity). Social ties wield influence on infant feeding decisions by acting as kinga, and as gates or open paths for the flow of capacities (uwezo) into and within networks. Various kinds of capacities affect perceived possibilities for infant feeding and how social ties are involved. The embracing or rejecting of responsibilities within ties, especially after HIV status disclosure, affects mothers?? networks and choices. Networks of influence are constantly changing: resource availability and social support are dynamic. Original conceptualisations of infant-feeding, risk, trust and disclosure networks and their interaction and change explain these patterns of involvement. Swahili-based conceptualisations are used to explain how social ties manage HIV and infant feeding in complex, dynamic ways. This thesis helps reposition approaches to working with Tanzanian mothers, families and communities to enhance support for mothers?? choices by building on collective capacities and responsibilities.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">networks</field><field name="subject">HIV</field><field name="subject">infant feeding</field><field name="subject">Tanzania</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43566</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving acid sulfate soils for brackish water aquaculture ponds in South Sulawesi, Indonesia</field><field name="creator">Mustafa, Akhmad, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Brackish water aquaculture is one of the largest coastal industries in Indonesia. This farming system involves the construction of ponds m coastal sediments. Many ponds in Indonesia have been abandoned due to past development of ponds in acid 8ulfate soils (ASS); these soils produce sulfuric acid through the oxidation of pyrite du ring and after the sediments have been excavated. The soils also contain elevated concentrations of metal such as iron and aluminium which are harmful to farmed fish and shrimp. Acidification of pond soil causes recurrent fish and shrimp mortalities, poor growth rate in fish and shrimp, soft shell syndrome in shrimp and low plankton densities, Pond maintenance costs in ASS are also significantly higher than non-ASS ponds. There are over 6.7 million ha of ASS In Indonesia of which 35% has been developed for brackish water aquaculture. This study developed and trialled methods of soil remediation to restore abandoned ASS-affected ponds. The main objective was to develop methods at remediation that were scientifically sound but also practical and inexpensive for farmers. The research involved characterising, in detail, the chemical and physical properties of ponds soil followed by laboratory-based experiments to improve soil properties. The results of laboratory trials were the basis for large-scale field experiments to test soil remediation strategies. The study showed that pond bottoms could be improved by forced oxidation, flooding and water exchange followed by Iiming and fertilising. Up to 500% increases in productivity were achieved by this method and soils conditions Improved significantly. A further twofold productivity increase was achieved by an integrated liming method in which lime is added to rebuilt or new dykes in layers. A juvenile shrimp production system was developed for ponds that were too severely degraded or costly to remediate. The research developed methods of preventing metal toxicity in Juvenile shrimp. The study showed that aquaculture ponds built in ASS could be remediated and returned to viable production systems. Importantly, the study has developed a more detailed understanding of chemical properties In ASS-affected ponds.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil acidity -- Analysis -- Indonesia.</field><field name="subject">Acid sulphate soils -- Indonesia.</field><field name="subject">Water Pollution -- Indonesia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40619</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impacts of metal-contaminated sediments: a temperate-polar investigation</field><field name="creator">Hill, Nicole Ann, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contaminated sediments pose a direct risk to sediment fauna and have the potential to affect other benthic assemblages. Disturbances that resuspend and remobilise contaminants may impact on filter-feeding, hard-substrate organisms that live immediately above sediments. This thesis uses laboratory and field manipulations to examine the impact of metal-contaminated sediments on sediment fauna and hard-substrate fauna simultaneously. It also compares the response of assemblages to metal contamination in a temperate and polar ecosystem. Simulated resuspension exposures in the laboratory indicated that contaminated sediments have the potential to affect hard-substrate organisms. Spirorbid polychaetes responded to both aqueous metals and to resuspended, particulate-bound metals. Impacts on hard-substrate fauna were however, not observed in manipulative field experiments using metal-spiked sediments. The recruitment and cover of hard-substrate organisms were either not affected or enhanced above contaminated sediments. In contrast, metal contamination had direct negative effects on sediment fauna, with a reduction in the abundance of most taxa. Results suggest that sediment fauna may interact with hard-substrate fauna through physical and/or biological mechanisms. In a reciprocal transplant experiment, established Antarctic hard-substrate assemblages were also unaffected by contaminant concentrations at an impacted site. Overall, metal-contaminated sediments are unlikely to pose as serious a threat to hard-substrate fauna as they do to sediment fauna.  Contaminated sediments are not restricted to industrialised regions, and human activities in Antarctica have resulted in localised contamination near research stations. Although Antarctic assemblages are thought to be more sensitive than temperate assemblages to contaminants, few studies have explicitly examined this. Little evidence was found to support the theory that Antarctic assemblages are more susceptible to contaminated sediments. The response of Antarctic and temperate assemblages in the field to metal-contaminated sediments over a 10-11 month period was comparable. Responses were of a similar magnitude, despite differences in the composition of assemblages. In 10-d toxicity tests, the mortality of a common Antarctic hard-substrate organism was relatively insensitive to aqueous Cu, Zn and Pb. These results suggest that using current sediment quality guidelines from Australia may be a useful screening tool to assess the risk associated with contaminated sediments in Antarctica.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Hard-substrate</field><field name="subject">Infauna</field><field name="subject">Sydney Harbour</field><field name="subject">Copper</field><field name="subject">Lead</field><field name="subject">Zinc</field><field name="subject">Resuspended sediment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43765</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reinterpreting the market orientation-performance relationship: a psychological perspective</field><field name="creator">Rong, Baiding, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Major problems are identified with the use of survey methodology to examine the relationship between market orientation (MO) and firm performance. The research, as it is argued, tells us more about managers' sense-making processes and causal attributions than whether and under what conditions MO drives performance, yet one way causal interpretations are still prevalent in the literature. The psychological mechanisms underlying managers' perceptions are identified and alternative causal paths specified for interpreting prior research results are proposed that also account for otherwise troublesome results. An exploratory experiment is designed to calibrate the extent of managers' attribution biases which is the most important part of the sensemaking framework. Different levels of performance, MO and environmental turbulence are manipulated in case scenarios. The results confirm a culture-centered view of MO and a strong psychological impact of performance on perceived environment turbulence. A multi-method view of studying the MO-performance link is proposed in the final part of the paper.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marketing.</field><field name="subject">Orientation (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Performance.</field><field name="subject">Markets.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40629</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate seasonal reservoir inflows: accounting for spatial and temporal variability</field><field name="creator">Westra, Seth Pieter, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hydrological variables such as rainfall and streamfiow vary at a range of temporal scales, from short term (diurnal and seasonal) to the inter annual time scales associated with the El Nino - Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) phenomena, to even longer time scales such as those linked to the Pacific (inter-) Decadal Oscillation (PDO). This temporal variability poses a significant challenge to hydrologists and water resource managers, since a failure to take such variability into account can lead to an underestimation of the likelihood of droughts and sequences of above average rainfall, which in turn has important implications for the design and operation of reservoirs for hydroelectricity generation, irrigation and municipal water supply. Understanding and accounting for this variability through well designed prediction systems is thus an important part of improving the planning, management and operation of complex water resources systems. This thesis outlines the application of two statistical techniques: wavelets and independent component analysis, to identify sources of hydrological variability, and then use this information to probabilistically generate multivariate seasonal forecasts or develop extended synthetic sequences of hydrological time series. The research is divided into four main parts. The first part outlines an application of the method of wavelets to analyse sources of Australian rainfall variability, and shows that there are coherent regions of variability in addition to the ENSO phenomenon that should be considered when developing seasonal forecasts. The second part examines the capability of three component extraction techniques: principal component analysis (PCA), Varimax and independent component analysis (ICA), in identifying and interpreting modes of variability in the global sea surface temperature dataset. The third part outlines a new technique that uses ICA to factorise multivariate reservoir inflow time series into a set of independent univariate time series, so that univariate methods can be used to develop multivariate synthetic sequences and probabilistic seasonal forecasts. Finally, the fourth part synthesises the previous three parts by demonstrating a wavelets- and correlation-based methodology for assessing sources of climate variability, and then using ICA to generate probabilistic multivariate seasonal forecasts of reservoir inflows that form part of Sydney's water supply system.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrology.</field><field name="subject">Wavelets (Mathematics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40630</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epistemologically different worlds</field><field name="creator">Vacariu, Gabriel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">A fundamental error has dominated philosophy and science since ancient times, the assumption of the existence of the "unicorn-world"-that is, the existence of one unique world. It is one of the oldest and most dominant paradigms in human thinking that has generated many pseudo-problems in philosophy and science. We can identify this thinking paradigm, the unicorn-world, in the majority of myths, theological doctrines, philosophical approaches and scientific theories.  In order to avoid this error, in Part I of this thesis, I show that it is necessary to replace the unicorn-world (in which all entities, such as Gods, minds, bodies, planets, tables and micro-particles have been placed all together) with "epistemologically different worlds" (which presuppose that each class of entities forms an epistemological different world). More than three centuries ago, Descartes was aware of the impossibility of solving an "anomaly" (the mind-body problem) but did not realize that the cause of this "mystery" is the unicorn-world. The role of Kantian a priori constitutive elements (categories and pure intuitions) is extended to the epistemologically constitutive interactions among classes of epistemologically different entities that belong to epistemologically different worlds. The consequence of the existence of epistemologically different worlds is that the famous mind-body problem is a false problem or a pseudo-problem.  In Part II, from the "epistemologically different worlds" perspective, I analyze notions from: (1) The philosophy of mind and cognitive science (the mind-body problem, emergence and reduction, mental causation and supervenience, levels, etc.) (2) The philosophy of science (Carnap's linguistic frameworks, Quine's and Goodman's relativity, Friedman's relative constitutive a priori principles) and the science of the twentieth century (the relationship between Einstein's theory of relatiVity and quantum mechanics, complementarity and superposition, entanglement, nonlocality and nonseparability from quantum mechanics).</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge, Theory of.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression profiling in Philadelphia positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treated with Imatinib -- a novel role of PKC epsilon signalling</field><field name="creator">Loi, To Ha, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Philadelphia positive (Ph+) Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is characterised by the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which encodes a protein tyrosine kinase with aberrant activity. Imatinib, a chemical Bcr-Abl inhibitor, is rarely effective in Ph+ ALL patients as a single agent.  In this study, insight into molecular and signalling changes occurring in Ph+ ALL during Imatinib therapy were investigated using cDNA microarrays. An optimal microarray assay was established to examine the gene expression changes in leukaemic cells from Ph+ ALL patients treated with Imatinib. Over 500 genes with &#8805;1.5-fold up- or down-regulation were identified. Based on gene ontology and novelty to Bcr-Abl signalling, six genes were selected and expression changes in five of these genes (PKC&#949;, PINK1, SPRY2, ATF4 and PECAM1) confirmed by real time RT-PCR in Imatinib treated primary Ph+ ALL cells or the SUP-B15 cell line.  The functional role of Protein Kinase C epsilon (PKC&#949;) in response to Imatinib was further investigated using the Ph+ lymphoid and myeloid cell lines, SUP-B15 and K562. Detection of Imatinib-induced apoptosis by annexin V and PI staining demonstrated that SUP-B15 cells were less sensitive to Imatinib compared to K562 cells. PKC&#949; mRNA was 50-fold higher in Ph+ ALL cells than Ph+ myeloid cells. In SUP-B15 cells, Imatinib upregulated PKC&#949; mRNA but the protein was reduced by proteolytic cleavage. Inhibition of caspases showed that this cleaved product was not required for Imatinib induced-apoptosis.  The treatment of SUP-B15 and primary Ph+ ALL cells with TAT-&#949;V1-2 peptide, a specific inhibitor of PKC&#949;, increased Imatinib-induced apoptosis. While the forced overexpression of PKC&#949; in K562 cells reduced Imatinib-induced apoptosis. This increased expression of PKC&#949; was associated with the increase of survival and anti-apoptotic proteins, Akt and Bcl-2.  In summary, Gene expression profiling of Ph+ ALL cells during Imatinib therapy identified PKC&#949; as an Imatinib responsive gene. A novel role of PKC&#949; in Ph+ ALL response to imatinib is proposed.  Experimental data presented in this thesis indicate that PKC&#949; mediates pro-survival/anti-apoptosis signals in Ph+ ALL thereby reducing Imatinib-induced death.  Thus, targeting PKC&#949; during Imatinib therapy may be beneficial for the future treatment of Ph+ ALL.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microarray.</field><field name="subject">Ph+ ALL.</field><field name="subject">Imatinib.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43343</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The 'Junto' and its Antecedents: the character and continuity of dissent under Charles I from the 1620s to the Grand Remonstrance</field><field name="creator">Van Duinen, Jared Pieter, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">ABSTRACT  This thesis aims to (re)examine the breakdown of consensus that led to the outbreak of the English Revolution.  It aims to do so from the particular perspective of a group of moderate godly laymen, commonly known as the 'Junto', who played a prominent role in the religious and political machinations of the Long Parliament before the outbreak of hostilities in 1642.  Of particular concern is an exploration of the ideological background of these men in order to delineate possible contours of continuity of thought and action extending from the 1620s to the Long Parliament; an objective which has been facilitated via the deployment of a kind of micro-prosopographical methodology which focuses more on qualitative rather than quantitative 'ties of association'.  With a view towards charting such contours of continuity, the 1630s provide the crux of the thesis.  To this purpose, a number of ties of association have been interrogated including the involvement of these men in colonisation schemes (in particular the Providence Island Company); their resistive action to prerogative taxation; the efficacy of godly communitarian and social ties; and their association with the irenic schemes of John Dury and Samuel Hartlib.  Deeply contextualised analysis of such ties of association has the potential to reveal and reframe previously obscured contours of continuity.  Furthermore, this focus not only sheds light on this important yet relatively neglected decade but also contributes to a growing body of post-revisionist research by reappraising the revisionist emphasis on short-term and non-ideological causes of the English Revolution.  This thesis demonstrates that, for these men at least, there can be discerned a continuity of dissident ideological thought and action stemming from the mid-1620s and receiving its fullest expression in the Grand Remonstrance of November 1641.  Moreover, although this dissident ideological framework had political/constitutional implications, it was fundamentally religious in origin and nature, stemming as it did from a reaction to the Arminianism of the Caroline ecclesiastical establishment in the 1620s and its subsequent Laudian efflorescence in the 1630s.  Thus this thesis demonstrates that for these men the causes of the English Revolution were essentially religious in nature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Puritanism</field><field name="subject">Junto</field><field name="subject">Charles I</field><field name="subject">Long Parliament</field><field name="subject">English Civil War</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43579</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of replication and genomic diversity in human caliciviruses</field><field name="creator">Bull, Rowena, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Norovirus (NoV) and Sapovirus (SaV) are major causes of outbreak gastroenteritis worldwide. NoV and SaV are highly infectious, have multiple transmission routes and have a short incubation period, thereby facilitating rapid intercontinental spread of new variants. Consequently, a treatment would be advantageous for controlling them. However, currently little is known about the replication cycle and evolution of human NoV or SaV as neither are culturable. NoV and SaV are RNA viruses of the Caliciviridae family and have great genetic diversity which is thought to facilitate irnmune evasion. Consequently variants of NoV GI1.4 arose in 1996, 2002, 2004 and in 2006 and resulted in pandemics. Therefore, in this study, the role of the two main mechanisms associated with generating viral diversity; recombination, and point mutation were investigated for NoV and SaV. Physiological and kinetic properties of three NoV RdRps (genotypes, Gll.b, Gll.4, Gll.7) and two SaV RdRps (genogroups GI, GII) were also investigated.  RNA recombination is a significant driving force in viral evolution. Increased awareness of recombination within the Calicivirus genus Norovirus (NoV) has led to a rise in the identification of NoV recombinants and they are now reported at high frequency. Despite this no classification system exists for recombinant NoVs As a result, there is duplication in reporting novel recombinants and the precise number of novel NoV recombinant types is unknown. Therefore, in order to elucidate thero!e of recombination in NoV evolution, 121 NoV nucleotide sequences, compiled from the GenBank database and published literature, were analysed for recombination events. NoV recombinants and their recombination breakpoint were identified using three methods: phylogenetic analysis, Simplot analysis and the Maximum Chi-Squared method. In total 19 unique NoV recombinant types were identified in circulation across the globe and they had a common recombination point near the ORF1/2 overlap. Recombination at the ORF1/0RF2 overlap could have important implications in NoV evolution as it enables a virus to swap its antigenic determinates (capsid) and thereby avoid immune clearance in an analogous manner to antigenic shift in influenza virus.  This study also examined the role of NoV and SaV replication in generating viral diversity by comparing the physiological, kinetic and biochemical properties of five genotypically distinct RdRps from two different genera of the Caliciviridae. Genetically diverse HuCV RdRps were expressed in Escherichia coli and characterised in an in vitro assay designed for this study. The results indicated that despite high sequence variation between the five enzymes (between 6% and 71% amino acid difference) they shared similar physiological properties. Though there was some variation in their template usage and kinetic properties. SaV was able to perform primer dependent replication on homopolymeric A RNA whereas the NoV RdRps were not. Additionally, NoV RdRps had a higher incorporation rate and were more kinetically efficient than the two SaV RdRps. The incorporation fidelity of the five enzymes was similar (between 2.2x10-5 to 8.9x10-4 ), although interestingly the most prevalent strain, Gll.4, had the lowest fidelity of the caliciviruses. Therefore, suggesting that RdRp fidelity has an important role in NoV evolution.  Overall, this study illustrated that NoV and SaV generate genetic diversity in a similar fashion to other RNA viruses, that is, a delicate combination of recombination, point mutation and replication efficiency. Understanding the mechanisms involved in viral replication and genomic diversity of the calicivirus RdRps is essential if a successful control strategy for the human caliciviruses is going to be developed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Viral gastroenteritis -- Diagnosis.</field><field name="subject">Viral gastroenteritis.</field><field name="subject">Viruses -- Reproduction.</field><field name="subject">RNA viruses.</field><field name="subject">Caliciviruses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40657</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of inter-company network technology on correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures</field><field name="creator">Wu, Gang, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research aims to examine how, and to what extent, the advanced network technology such as custom-built large-scale network, or internet-based technology contribute to the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures. The uniqueness of the research is to use network technology as a leverage factor, instead of merely one of the supply chain drivers, to analyse how it would impact on the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures.  Through literature review, we identified the key drivers in supply chain and the key performance indicators as independent and dependent variables respectively for data analysis in the research. We consider the utilisation of network technology as a selection variable in the analysis. We also proposed a set of research questions and hypotheses resulting from the literature review.  The subsequent data analyses attempted to find answers for these questions and test the validity of the hypotheses. This was achieved by a field survey for 1035 major Australian firms through a structured questionnaire. The response rate of the survey was 20.8%. All these data were analysed with statistical models such as reliability test, multi-collinearity test, MANOVA procedures, factor analysis, and multiple regression modelling to validate whether the survey was robust and how the leverage factor (network technology) would impact on the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures.  Each research question and hypothesis was reviewed, validated, and concluded based on the results from data analysis. The key findings from the data analysis support the perception that the network technologies with their external customers and suppliers dramatically affect the correlations between supply chain drivers and performance measures. Statistically it actually determines whether the supply chain will success or fail when comparing firms using the technologies with firms not using them. In general, the impact on the correlations is directional and positive. A set of validated theoretical models was also proposed to depict the dynamics between supply chain variables under the influence of network technology.  Implications of the findings are also provided in the thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Supply chain driver</field><field name="subject">Supply chain</field><field name="subject">Network technology</field><field name="subject">Performance measure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43645</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The councils of Henry II in England</field><field name="creator">Cerda, Jos?? Manuel, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main objective of this thesis is to offer an understanding of the nature and political importance of English royal councils in the reign of Henry II (1154 -- 1188), a subject that has never attracted historical attention before. While the analysis of particularly controversial meetings has been incorporated in several studies, the common features of councils have never been made a subject of historical enquiry.  The present study has relied on the evidence provided in contemporary sources, such as the numerous chronicle and a large body of royal charters, treatises, and official documents which have been preserved for this period. It has also studied a number of political, legal, administrative and "seal treatises, all of which provide useful insights into the mentalities of the time and the Institutional makeup and governance of England under Henry II.  The first chapter is a chronological narrative which aims to introduce the reader into the subject and to associate group of councils with the different phases in Henry's reign. Then the terminology employed in the sources to identify and describe these meetings is analysed so to understand how were these assemblies perceived in the political community. The third chapter deals with the circumstantial aspects of councils by offering a study of the places and buildings where assemblies take place, as well as the calendar and the frequency they followed. The following two chapters discuss the evidence for and the process of conciliar consultation, and the matters discussed at royal councils In this period. The following chapter studies the attendance and the social aspects of these meetings. The last chapter Is an essay which evaluates the place occupied by these councils within the early history of parliament.  The central conclusion which brings together all these chapters is that the unprecedented frequency with which Henry II summoned great assemblies meant that most important decisions made during his reign are connected with conciliar activity and, therefore, assented by the nobles of the realm, and that gathering councils consequently became a very useful Instrument of royal governance and a most public occasion for baronial politics in this period.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Politics and culture -- England -- History.</field><field name="subject">Henry II, King of England, 1133-1189.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40671</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Differential tolerance of introduced &amp; native marine invertebrates to heavy metal pollution</field><field name="creator">Piola, Richard Fabio, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In near-shore marine environments, two of the most prevalent anthropogenic disturbances affecting ecosystem diversity and function are the invasion of exotic species, and the release of toxic chemicals. Estuarine and harbour environments worldwide are dually subjected to high levels of toxic disturbance and ever increasing rates of invasion, via activities such as boating and shipping. It is not clear, however, whether the success of invasive species is influenced by the presence of toxic contaminants in these impacted environments. In particular, nonindigenous marine species (NIS) may be advantaged in chemically disturbed environments if they are more tolerant of toxicants. This thesis examines whether nonindigenous and native sessile invertebrate species have differential tolerance to a common aquatic contaminant, copper (Cu), which has links to both the invasion process (via its use in antifouling paints and the vector of hull fouling) and the modification of recipient environments (via human-mediated pollution). A series of laboratory- and field-based experiments showed that the cosmopolitan invasive bryozoans Watersipora subtorquata, Bugula neritina and Schizoporella errata are highly tolerant of copper pollution. The larvae and adults of W. subtorquata and B. neritina in particular were able to survive and grow in copper-polluted environments far exceeding most observed real-world levels (&lt; 100 /??g 1-1). These nonindigenous species also showed very strong postexposure recovery. In contrast, the co-occurring native bryozoans Celleporaria nodulosa and Fenestrulina mutabilis demonstrated comparatively low tolerance to copper, with markedly reduced survival and fitness under Cu contaminated conditions, and inferior recovery abilities post-exposure. These findings were further supported by a long-term manipulative field experiment, examining the effect that varying levels of Cu exposure have on the structure and diversity of developing sessile invertebrate assemblages. Cu exposure decreased native species diversity by up to 50%, yet had no effect on NIS numbers. Consequently, in the presence of copper contamination, NIS dominated sessile communities, often resulting in substantial changes to community structure. Important insights were also gained into the nature of metal tolerance in NIS. Toxicity studies on larvae of the introduced bryozoan Bugula neritina revealed intraspecific differences in tolerance to Cu, associated with the level of pollution experienced by the adult source populations. There was also evidence of fitness costs related with increased Cu tolerance. In summary, we have found evidence that the success of invasive species is influenced by chemical contamination. NIS may be advantaged in contaminated estuaries relative to native species and this may assist in their establishment and persistence in new habitats.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Introduced animals.</field><field name="subject">Pollution -- Environmental aspects.</field><field name="subject">Invertebrates -- Effect of metals on.</field><field name="subject">Invertebrates -- Ecology .</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of endogenous stem cells and reactive astrocytes in post-traumatic syringomyelia</field><field name="creator">Liao, Jinxin, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: Around a quarter of patients with spinal cord injury develop post traumatic syringomyelia (PTS), causing progressive neurological deficits. Current surgical treatment is unsatisfactory. Endogenous stem cell therapy, aiming at replacing lost tissue and repairing damaged ones by endogenous progenitors, may offer hope. Investigation into the reaction of endogenous progenitors in PTS may extend our knowledge about stem cell biology and help to develop a new treatment option for PTS. Endogenous stem cells were found to differentiate into astrocytes. Reactive astrocytes and gliosis are shown to have an important role in spinal cord injury, such as protecting neurons, limiting inflammation and regulating local environment to suit progenitors. We hypothesize that reactive astrocytes may play an important protective and potential therapeutic roles in PTS. The aim of this thesis is to study proliferation, differentition and location of endogenous progenitors and their roles in PTS.  Materials and methods: Excitotoxic injury model of PTS was performed in adult Wistar rats. Proliferating cells were marked by either exogenous mitotic marker bromodeoxyuridine or endogenous mitotic marker Ki67.lmmunofluorescence techniques targeting mitotic markers were used to trace the proliferating cells. Immunofluorescent double staining techniques were used to phenotype the proliferating cells.  Results: A large number of endogenous progenitors appear in PTS from 24 hours to at least 8 weeks post injury (PI). They proliferate much faster in PTS than in the control animals. Although less endogenous progenitors are observed after 4 weeks PI, their number is still much higher than that in the control animals. Immediately after injury, progenitors exist mainly in the white matter, but the majority of them shift their position closer to the lesion within 2 days. In the chronic stage, the majority of stem cells are located in and around the lesion site. Endogenous progenitors differentiate into astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes or neurons within 8 weeks. Astrocytes respond to injury by upgrading GFAP (1 day PI), becoming hypertrophic (7 days PI) and forming glial scar (2 weeks PI) in PTS. The development of a glial scar corresponds with the stage of cyst stability or reduction in size.  Conclusions: Endogenous progenitors exist in PTS and they respond to injury by proliferating and shifting their position towards the lesion. These studies are important in understanding the endogenous stem cell response to PTS and lay the groundwork for future studies examining stem cell therapy for the condition. Endogenous progenitors in the PTS model differentiate into astrocytes, which help to form the glial scar lining the syrinx. Reactive gliosis may play an important role to seclude the injury site from healthy tissue, prevent a cascading wave of uncontrolled tissue damage and restrict the syrinx enlargement.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Syringomyelia.</field><field name="subject">Stem cells.</field><field name="subject">Astrocytes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40674</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High dynamic range direct imaging of exoplanets with an off-axis Antarctic telescope</field><field name="creator">Britton, Tui Rose, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an analysis of the potential for high dynamic range direct imaging of exoplanets with a propsed off-axis Antarctic telescope named the Large Antarctic Plateau Clear-Aperture Telescope (LAPCAT). LAPCAT is a proposed 8.4 metre off-axis telescope with a deformable 1 m secondary mirror to be located at Dome C in Antarctica.  The low atmospheric temperatures and minimal high altitude turbulence make Dome C a unique site for astronomical observations. The low wind speeds, the absence of dust in the atmosphere and minimal seismic activity make this a very stable site. The off-axis design of LAPCAT will assist in reducing the emissitivity of the secondary mirror and spider arms which are likely to dominate the infra-red background at these low temperatures. Low sky emissivity is also desirable for high contrast direct imaging of faint infrared sources such as exoplanets. The performance due to LAPCAT's off-axis design, adaptive optics system, and Antarctic location is quantified here. Simulations have been run to compare the point spread functions of LAPCAT, two existing mid-latitude on-axis telescopes, and a hypothetical on-axis Antarctic telescope. For comparison I chose the Keck II telescope located at Mauna Kea, Hawaii, and Gemini South situated on Cerro Paranal, Chile. Keck II is an on-axis segmented telescope and Gemini is an on-axis monolithic telescope. Under diffraction-limited, seeing-limited and adaptive-optics-corrected seeing conditions the telescopes' PSFs is compared at six different wavelengths. Simulations were run at 1.25, 1.26, 2.2, 3.4, 5, and 10 &#956;m, using Performance of Adaptive Optics for Large Apertures (PAOLA), an analytical adaptive optics simulation package written in IDL.  Having studied the effects of a typical Antarctic atmospheric turbulence profile on the PSF, LAPCAT can be expected to out-perform similar aperture telescopes located at temperate sites. Results demonstrate the intended adaptive optics system for LAPCAT allows the telescope to reach the diffraction limit. LAPCAT is able to detect a 20 MJ 5 Gyr old planet out to 10 pc, and a 5 Gyr planet less than 40 MJ out to 100 pc at 5 &#956;m. For 1 Gyr planets the best observing wavelengths are 5 &#956;m and 10 &#956;m. The results demonstrate that LAPCAT is more sensitive to hot young extrasolar giant planets but is unable to directly image an exoplanet with a mass less than 4 MJ.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43607</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular modelling applications in crystallization fouling and clay/polymer nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Mrayed, Sabri Mohamed Ali, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present work used ab initio density functional theory (DFT) to study two different physical phenomena crystallization fouling and clay-based polymer nanocomposites. In the first part, two foulant materials were studied including calcium carbonate, and calcium sulfate. The lattice energy and enthalpy of formations of each crystal system were predicted using DFT methods. The most stable forms of calcium carbonate foul ant, calcite and aragonite, were investigated. For calcium sulfate, both gypsum and anhydrite crystals were investigated. The thermodynamic solubility product of each crystal system, for both foul ants, was predicted from the lattice energy and enthalpy of formations. Comparison of the stability between the different crystal systems for the same foul ant material was carried out to elucidate the effect of crystal atomic configuration and space group on the stability of foulant materials. The effect of temperature on the formation and stability of foulant material was also carried out. The results obtained using DFT methods, for enthalpy of formation and thermodynamic solubility products, were comparable with the experimental data reported in the literature.  In the second part, study has been made on the clay-based nylon 6 nanocomposite materials. The purpose was to understand the interfacial interactions between clay and polymer with and without surfactant component. Both sides of the clay were examined with nylon 6. In order to determine specifically the type of interfacial interaction between clay and nylon 6, the electron distribution around the whole system was predicted. The study was carried out at various isomorphic substitutions. The substitutions took place at both octahedral and tetrahedral layers of the clay. The strength between clay and nylon 6 was predicted by calculating the binding energy. The results obtained revealed that, the strength increases with the increase in the degree of isomorphic substitutions. The type of bond between nylon 6 and basal surface of the clay was found to be basically electrostatic interactions, and particularly hydrogen bonds. Whilst, the type of interactions between nylon 6 and clay edge surface was found to include covalent bonds as well as electrostatic interactions. The formation and breakage of covalent bonds between nylon 6 and clay means that, a chemical decomposition of the clay can happen when it is mixed with certain type of polymers. The presence of surfactant can decrease the interfacial interactions between clay and nylon 6.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Decomposition (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Crystallization.</field><field name="subject">Clay.</field><field name="subject">Modeling.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation of yeasts and yeast-like fungi associated with Australian wine grapes using cultural and molecular methods</field><field name="creator">Beh,  Ai Lin, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a systematic investigation ofyeasts associated with wine grapes cultivated in several Australian vineyards during the 2001-2003 vintages. Using a combination of cultural and molecular methods, yeast populations of red (Cabernet sauvignon, Merlot, Tyrian) and white (Sauvignon blanc, Semilion) grape varieties were examined throughout grape cultivation.  The yeast-like fungus, Aureobasidium pullulans, was the most prevalent species found on grapes. Various species of Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces were frequently isolated throughout grape maturation. Ripe grapes showed an increased incidence of Hanseniaspora and Metschnikowia species for the 2001-2002 seasons, but not for the drought affected, 2002-2003 seasons. Atypical, hot and dry conditions may account for this difference in yeast flora and have limited comparisons of data to determine the influences of vineyard location, grape variety and pesticide applications on the yeast ecology. More systematic and controlled studies of these variables are required. Damaged grape berries harboured higher yeast populations and species diversity than intact healthy berries.  PCR-DGGE analysis was less sensitive than plate culture for describing the diversity of yeast species on grapes; it detected prevalent species, but subdominant populations below 103 CFU/g were not detected. In some cases, PCR-DGGE revealed the presence ofyeasts (Candida galli, C. zemplinina) not isolated by culture. Fermentative wine species (Kluyveromyces, Torulaspora, Saccharomyces) were rarely isolated, and only detected by enrichment cultures.  Significant morphological and genetic variability were detected among A. pullulans and other black yeasts isolates from grapes. Taxonomic characterization of 61 strains by ITS-RFLP and rDNA sequencing revealed that they belonged to several distinct species within the generic groupings ofAureobasidium, Hormonema and Kabatiella. Isolates were strong producers of extracellular enzymes and polysaccharides that could have oenological significance, and, using a plate assay, some were antagonistic towards Bacillus thuringiensis, several wine yeasts, and some spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi found on grapes. Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was not inhibited by these organisms in grape juice.  A species-specific probe was developed for the identification of the wine spoilage yeast, Zygosaccharomyces bailii in a microtitre plate hybridization assay. The probe detected 102 cells/ml in wine, reliably differentiating Z. bailii from other Zygosaccharomyces and other wine-related yeasts.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Yeast.</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making -- Microbiology.</field><field name="subject">Wine and wine making -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Yeast fungi.</field><field name="subject">Yeast-like fungi.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Whale-watching in NSW: research to integrate the needs of whales, tourists and industry</field><field name="creator">Stamation, Kasey Anne, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the human and animal dimensions of whale-watching and develops a framework for management of the humpback whale-watching industry in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The short-term responses of humpback whales to whale-watching vessels during their southward migration on the south coast of NSW were assessed. The behaviour of pods was recorded from commercial whale-watching vessels during tours and compared to pods in the absence of vessels observed from shore in the same area. Pod sizes and composition were typical of southward migrating whales. Calf pods were more sensitive to the presence of vessels than non-calf pods. Whilst there was a longer dive time and a greater percentage of time spent submerged by whales in the presence of vessels, there were no associated changes in respiration intervals. Some surface behaviours were suppressed in the presence of vessels. Surface-active behaviours were prevalent in this study which indicates that social interactions amongst conspecifics are common during the southern migration. Feeding pods were observed on 24.5% of all whale-watching trips and during 14% of all observations made from shore. South-eastern NSW is probably a significant supplemental feeding ground for migrating whales. Feeding behaviour did not alter in the presence of vessels but the time between feeding lunges increased when vessels were closer than 100 m and when more than one vessel was present. The demographics, expectations, experience and satisfaction of land-based and boat-based whale-watchers in NSW were assessed by a questionnaire to participants. Land-based whale-watchers had high and often unrealistic expectations about their whale-watching experience and were moderately satisfied. Boat-based whale-watchers had high, but often realistic expectations of their experience and were highly satisfied. Satisfaction was a function of the degree to which expectations were met, the proximity of whales, the numbers of whales, their behavioural displays and the level of information available on whales. Whale-watchers showed limited increase in their knowledge and conservation-oriented behaviours over the long term. Current education about whales requires better structure and clearer conservation objectives. This study identifies research, education and vessel management as three fundamental components for the sustainable management of the whale-watching industry, and makes recommendations incorporating these components.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable tourism</field><field name="subject">Humpback whales</field><field name="subject">Whale watching</field><field name="subject">Behavioural responses</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43726</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inert anodes for aluminium electrowinning: nickel ferrite based cermets</field><field name="creator">Channing, Amanda, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide are formed by the consumption of carbon anodes during aluminium production, making it a major contributor to global emissions. This consumption necessitates replacement of the anodes in electrolysis cells every 2-3 weeks.  A solution to the environmental and economic problems posed may be found in an inert anode which facilitates direct decomposition of alumina to aluminium and oxygen. Finding a material which is stable in the aggressive high temperature electrolyte poses a major materials engineering challenge.  In this study, apparatus was designed and constructed to allow cermets to be manufactured in the laboratory, and a method of establishing electrical contact developed. Additionally, apparatus was designed to perform high temperature conductivity measurements on the cermets.  Nickel ferrite-nickel oxide-copper-silver cermets were prepared and conductivity measured. No significant change in the activation energy of the conduction process was observed for cermets with 40wt% excess NiO compared to those with no excess. No significant difference in conductivity was observed between the compositions at cell operating temperatures.  Voltammetric techniques were used to identify anode processes. High anodic currents associated with oxidation of anode constituents were observed repeatedly, the magnitude of which could not  simply explained by oxidation of the metal phase. This suggested the formation of other reduced species during sintering (confirmed by thermodynamic analysis).  Gaseous oxidation products were confirmed at the anode at potentials expected for oxygen evolution, and the application of high potentials (&gt;4V vs Al/A13+) was found to passivate the cermets.  Voltammetry and chemical microanalysis (using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDS)) showed that copper in the cermets was depleted at the anode surface, apparently by oxidation then dissolution into the electrolyte.  The inclusion of silver powder into the cermets was not found to improve the corrosion resistance of the cermets, existing almost entirely as a discrete phase. Preliminary SEM and EDS results highlighted several areas for further investigation regarding the compounds formed during sintering and electrolysis and the anode corrosion mechanisms. Of particular interest were a copper nickel oxide formed during sintering and complex oxyfluorides containing anode and bath constituents, formed during electrolysis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aluminum.</field><field name="subject">Anodes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of bast fibre structure on the mechanical properties of natural fibre composites</field><field name="creator">Ruys, David Julian, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Composite materials based on natural bast fibres offer potential commercial and environmental benefits due to the low cost, availiability, and biodegradability of the fibres. However, such benefits cannot be realised without a comprehensive evaluation of processing and properties. This thesis involved a comprehensive evaluation of composites based on two types of natural bast fibre (hemp and flax), and two types of matrix - synthetic (epoxy), and biodegradable (Novamont Mater-Si). The experimental work involved four strands: the effects of growing conditions and fibre processing on the properties of raw bast fibres; the optimisation of a pultrusion process for epoxy-matrix composites; development of a film stacking process for Mater-Bi composites, and a detailed evaluation of the mechanical properties of the composites themselves.  Fibre bundles and individual fibre cells were investigated to characterise their structure, with particular focus on compressive kink defects. The kink bands were sectioned using a novel technique of focused ion beam milling, and kinking was found to induce delamination and voiding of the lamellar fibre structure. The defect concentration per unit length was assessed for conventionally-processed fibres and for hemp fibres from plants grown under controlled conditions to assess the effect of wind shear and stem flexure on fibre defect concentration. No effect was found for plant flexure, while industrially processed fibre was found to have increased defect concentration.  The loading behaviour of both types of composite was seen to be initially linear with a yield point at 20 - 30 MPa and a transition to nonlinear deformation dominated by damage mechanisms as a result of fibre kinks. Epoxy composites possessed an inital modulus of 30 GPa with a 30 - 60% reduction in modulus after yield. Flax reinforcement was found to increase the modulus of Mater-Bi from 0.1 to 20 GPa and strength from 24 to 169 MPa. Fibre addition was also found to significantly embrittle the polymers.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fibers -- Testing.</field><field name="subject">Fibers.</field><field name="subject">Fibers -- Analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40688</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Small time asymptotics of implied volatility under local volatility models</field><field name="creator">Guo, Zhi Jun, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Under a class of one dimensional local volatility models, this thesis establishes closed form small time asymptotic formulae for the gradient of the implied volatility, whether or not the options are at the money, and for the at the money Hessian of the implied volatility.

Animal and in vitro studies suggest that the toxicity of asbestos is due to the iron content of the fibres which not only generate oxidants directly, but also activate the inflammatory cells in the lung that contribute to oxidative stress. This study therefore sought to establish data in man to corroborate the animal and in vitro evidence. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection is a novel, non-invasive technique to collect samples from the lung for investigating inflammatory biomarkers of lung diseases. This technique is harmless, rapid and easily repeatable which leads itself to the investigation of lung diseases such as asbestos-related diseases and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) that are otherwise difficult to study. The hypothesis tested was that oxidative and nitrosylative stress markers will be elevated in the EBC of patients with asbestos-related diseases and PF compared to normal control subjects. Methods:  The study design was a cross-sectional and observational in vivo study whereby EBC was collected and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and carbon monoxide (eCO) were measured. EBC markers including pH, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), total nitrogen oxides (NOx), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), 8-isoprostane (8-iso), total protein and transforming growth factor-&#946;1 (TGF&#946;1) were measured by microelectrode analysis, colorimetric and enzyme immunoassays. 3-NT and 8-iso were further examined by immunohistochemical techniques in samples of lung tissue.  Results: Subjects with asbestosis had significantly raised levels of EBC H2O2, 8-iso, total protein and FeNO compared with healthy individuals. The same markers except H2O2, but with 3-NT and eCO were again significantly increased in those with other causes of PF, compared with control subjects. Heavy nitrotyrosine staining was found on the lung sections from patients with asbestosis and PF.	Conclusions: This study confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species is associated with asbestos exposure and pulmonary fibrosis in vivo confirming animal and in vitro studies. Analysis of EBC may prove a useful non-invasive tool in exploring the basic pathophysiology of lung diseases in clinical research and may in the future be used to monitor progress in asbestosis and pulmonary fibrosis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pulmonary fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Exhaled breath condensate</field><field name="subject">Asbestosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43771</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The treatment of cyanidation tailings using ion exchange resin</field><field name="creator">Fernando, Kapila, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the behaviour of metal cyanide complexes under oxidative acid conditions in ion exchange systems, with the objective of developing an ion exchange based process for the treatment of gold cyanidation tailings. The novel cyanide detoxification process developed from this study employs strong base ion exchange resins to extract cyanide from tailings. Variations in the stability of cyanide complexes are exploited to concentrate, recover, or destroy cyanide species loaded on the resin, through the use of an oxidative acid eluent containing H2O2 and H2SO4. This eluent removes all base metal cyanide complexes from strong base resins, while regenerating the resin. The spent eluent, containing the base metals recovered from the tailings, can be used as a source of such base metals. Copper can be recovered separately from other base metals if necessary. Low levels of precious metals present in the tailings are accumulated on the resin as the ion exchange bed is cycled between loading and elution stages. They can be recovered economically, so as to offset the cost of the tailings detoxification. Cyanide is initially concentrated as an alkaline solution, which can be detoxified within the process or recovered for recycling.   This process was successfully tested at pilot scale by treating approximately 14,000 m3 of cyanide contaminated tailings solution, over 14 loading/elution cycles on a standard strong base ion exchange resin bed. This treatment reduced the total cyanide concentration of the contaminated solution from approximately 50 mg/L to an average of 1.5 mg/L. The reagent cost was approximately ADD 0.50 per m3 of treated liquor. When the resin was repeatedly loaded with mixed metal cyanide species and eluted with the oxidative acid eluent, a gradual deterioration of the ion exchange resin performance was noted. The reduction of net operating capacity of the columns due to resin deterioration was in the order of 1-3% per loading/elution cycle. The oxidation of resin catalysed by copper, the precipitation of metal hexacyanoferrates on the resin and the oxidation of Au(CN)2- to Au(CN)4- were identified as possible factors giving rise to the reduction of resin loading capacity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ion exchange resins.</field><field name="subject">Tailings (Metallurgy)</field><field name="subject">Cyanide process.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Minority responses to the nation-state: Transylvanian Saxon ethno-corporatism, 1919-1933</field><field name="creator">Davis, Sacha Edward, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Transylvanian Saxons provide a case study of how small minorities respond to their lack of statehood and the imposition of an "alien" nation-state upon them. In this thesis, I will argue that, as with many other minorities unwilling or unable to form a nation-state in their own right, the Saxons sought collective rights on the basis of self-determination. This included access to resources, self-administration, an independent education system, the ability to exclude outgroups and powers by which to ensure social norms within the community. Their aims did not include territorial autonomy or independence, and for this reason it is necessary to consider their strivings as distinct from nationalism. I term this attempt to secure collective self-determination by non-territorial means "ethnocorporatism". The goals of Saxon ethno-corporatism were influenced by the broader discussion of minority rights in interwar Europe before and after the First World War. In this sense, the Saxons were typical of many small communities in interwar Europe.  The Saxons approached the challenges of ethno-corporatism by numerous means. These included the pursuit of collective legal rights by negotiation with the Romanian state, positing a broader multi-ethnic Transylvanian polity that would guarantee collective ethnic rights, pursuing ethno-corporatism under the banner of religious freedoms and seeking to strengthen ties with other German communities. While a number of these strategies met with partial success, none fully compensated for the lack of a state, and all fell short of Saxon expectations. I argue that disappointment with other attempts to achieve ethnocorporate status led to growing radicaIisation of Saxon ethnic identity, and to the eventual adoption of fascism. In this sense, while influenced by currents from Germany, Saxon "National Socialism" can paradoxically be seen as stemming from the pursuit of minority right.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saxons -- Romania -- Transylvania -- History.</field><field name="subject">Germany -- History.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40698</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization techniques for XML databases</field><field name="creator">Lam, Franky Shung Lai, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we address several fundamental concerns of maintaining and querying huge ordered label trees.

However technical trading rules have continued to be used by practioners and have been the focus of many academic studies which have focused on equity, foreign exchange and futures markets. The scarcity of research into technical trading models for fixed income markets is astonishing considering the significant size and consequent investor importance of fixed income markets relative to other financial markets and the extensive application of technical trading models by market participants. This is one of the few studies that develops a technical trading model applicable to fixed income markets.  Black (1986) defined Efficient Markets as a market where deviations from fundamental values were short lived and small in magnitude. Fundamental asset values are hard to calculate, but we are able to identify fundamental values for a set of Government Bonds on the principle that yield relativities between such bonds are quite stable except for 'deliberate' changes in trading behaviour. We find that the deviations from fundamental value are short lived and small in magnitude. We exploit deviations from fundamental value by Butterfly Trading strategies; Normal Butterfly trades earning returns from movements in yield curve slope and curvature and Arbitrage Butterfly trades earning returns from yield curve curvature only. After considering transaction costs, we achieve annualised returns of 120bps from our Normal Butterfly trades and 72 bps from our Arbitrage Butterfly trades. Consistent with the risk-return relationship for financial instruments, we find that the returns and the volatility of returns for Normal Butterfly trades are higher than the returns and volatility of returns for Arbitrage Butterfly trades. Normal Butterfly trades are exposed to yield curve slope changes whereas Arbitrage Butterfly trades are not, resulting in higher risk and higher returns for Normal Butterfly trades.

The disadvantage of systemic cancer therapy is that only a small portion of the administered drug can reach the tumor cells, and side effects could occur due to its wide distribution in the body. In recent years, cytoreductive surgery combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been the effective way for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis. But the anticancer agents in aqueous form can be easily absorbed through capillaries below the large serosal surface into the systemic circulation, and it is difficult to retain the drug at a high concentration for a long time in the peritoneal cavity. The ideal drug for intraperitoneal chemotherapy should have a high molecular weight, a prolonged retention in the peritoneal surface, and increase drug exposure to tumor cells, decrease drug absorption and hence reduce systemic toxicity. ABZ (albendazole) with its properties of poor water solubility and strong anticancer effects could be a potential effective agent for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis.  The aims of this study are: to compare oral versus i.p administration of ABZ, study pharmacokinetic characteristics of ABZ in i.p administration; to study the efficacy ofABZ on early, middle and later stages of cancer development, to find out the possible antitumor effect of ABZ in suppressing cancer cell proliferation, ascites control and longer survival of mice with peritoneal carcinomatosis; to solve the occurring problems during ABZ i.p administration, reduce side effects and increase the drug efficacy; to investigate possible mechanisms ofABZ suppressing tumor proliferation and ascites formation.  A series of experiments were designed in order to achieve the study objectives. The pharmacokinetic study of ABZ gives some dynamic characteristics by oral versus i.p administration in rabbits. Three sets of experiments of ABZ treatment were performed on different stages peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from the OVCAR-3 cancer cells in nude mice, from which the efficacy of ABZ in suppressing tumor growth and ascites formation by i.p administration is clearly demonstrated. The increased solubility of ABZ with three surfactants and in human ascites was carried out in different tests, and the combination of ABZ with Tween 80 has achieved better control of peritoneal carcinomatosis when given by i.p administration. The results from this study have revealed for the first time the capacity of ABZ suppressing VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and ascites formation profoundly, confirmed that ABZ has potent anti-proliferation effects on ovarian cancer cells (OVCAR3); it suppressed tumor growth in early stage of cancer development; and prolonged survival of all ABZ treated mice by i.p administration.  The major contributions from this study are: ABZ i.p treatment increases survival, inhibits ascites production, reduces tumor burden at relatively early stage of cancer, changes tumor morphology and reduces vascular density, reduces CA-125 (cancer antigen 125) and VEGF level, decreases in vitro VEGF secretion, and down regulates VEGF mRNA expression. The study results concluded that ABZ could be a potential anticancer agent for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis by i.p administration. The significance of this study is that the fundamental results obtained from all experiments, including the major contributions and other associated works, have provided the scientific foundation for a clinical trial.  Currently the maximum tolerated dose of ABZ i.p treatment in mice is on going before clinical trial and studies in related area of ABZ anticancer pathways are continuing in our laboratory.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peritoneum -- Cancer -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Benzimidazoles.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40714</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The microencapsulation and transplantation of fetal pig islet-like cell clusters: a potential therapy for type 1 diabetes</field><field name="creator">Foster,  Jayne Louise, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Diabetes can be considered to be one of the main health epidemics of the 21st century. Studies conducted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) indicate that the number of people with diabetes in the year 2000 was 171 million and this is projected to increase to 366 million by 2030 (Wild et al. 2004). The increasing incidence of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes is due to population growth, aging, urbanisation, obesity and physical inactivity. The current treatment by insulin injections for individuals with Type 1 diabetes fails to overcome the long term microvascular and macrovascular complications associated with the disease. A major challenge in the treatment of diabetes is to provide patients with an insulin source that is capable of regulating blood glucose levels (BGL) on a minute to minute basis. Advances in medical research have enabled the investigation of a variety of potential alternative therapies that may provide Type 1 diabetic patients with a more superior control of BGL and consequently minimise complications.  The utilisation of pancreases obtained from fetal pigs offers potential therapeutic value in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes. Islet-like cell clusters (ICCs) are obtained from such tissue following partial mechanical and enzymatic digestive procedures. ICCs are primarily composed of immature duct cells which, when transplanted, will mainly differentiate into insulin producing ?? cells. Such cells are able to normalise BGL in immunodeficient diabetic recipients and in immunocompetent recipients when anti-rejection drugs are administered. This study investigates microencapsulation as an immunoprotective strategy that has the potential to remove the need for immunosuppression when such cells are transplanted.  A review of the literature related to current medical research in the field of diabetes is presented in Chapter 1. In order to achieve the aims of the study, an understanding of how fetal pig ICCs behave when placed within a barium alginate microcapsule both in vitro and in vivo is essential and this data is presented in Chapter 3. This chapter demonstrates that ICCs will survive and differentiate in their typical manner when enclosed within microcapsules and transplanted. Such encapsulated cells will function to normalise BGL when transplanted into diabetic immunodeficent mice for at least 25 weeks and the animals exhibit increased bodyweight. Microcapsules retrieved at this time point were observed to be intact with no breakages or evidence of cellular overgrowth. Transplantation of encapsulated insulin-producing cells into immunocompetent mice are described in Chapter 4. Allotransplantation of a microencapsulated mouse insulin-producing cell line into these diabetic mice also exhibited graft function, resulting in normal BGL in recipients. Large animal experiments are described in Chapter 5. Allotransplantation of microencapsulated fetal pig ICCs into diabetic pig recipients displayed evidence of transient graft function in terms of lower BGL and reduced exogenous insulin requirements.  The xenotransplantion of encapsulated fetal pIg ICCs into diabetic immunocompetent mice described in Chapter 4 proved to be more challenging. The transplantation of such cells in this environment did not yield particularly positive results. BGL remained elevated in these recipients and the animals lost bodyweight post transplantation. This area of research warrants further investigation as it is likely that further measures such as transient immunosuppression in combination with microencapsulation will allow fetal pig ICCs to function in a xenograft setting.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transplantation immunology.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Microencapsulation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design methodology for ontology-based multi-agent applications (MOMA)</field><field name="creator">Ying, Weir, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Software agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) have grown into a very active area of research and commercial development activity. There are many current emerging real-world applications spanning multitude of diverse domains. In the context of agents, ontology has been widely recognised for their significant benefits to interoperability, reusability, and both development and operational aspects of agent systems and applications. Ontology-based multi-agent systems (OBMAS) exploit these advantages in providing intelligent and semantically aware applications.  In addressing the lack of support for ontology in existing methodologies for multi-agent development, this thesis proposes a design methodology for the building of such intelligent multi-agent applications called MOMA. This alternative approach focuses on the development of ontology as the driving force of the development process. By allowing the domain and characteristics of utilisation and experimentation to be dictated through ontology, researchers and domain experts can specify the agent application without any knowledge of agent design and lower level programming. Through the use of a structured ontology model and the use of integrated tools, this approach contributes towards the building of semantically aware intelligent applications for use by researchers and domain experts.  MOMA is evaluated through case studies in two different domains: financial services and e-Health.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">e-Health</field><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Multi-Agent Systems</field><field name="subject">e-Finance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40717</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of many-body theory methods to atomic problems.</field><field name="creator">Dinh, Thi Hanh, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is strong interest in atomic and nuclear physics to the study of superheavy elements by the search for the island of stability in the region Z=104 to Z=126. There are many experimental efforts and theoretical works devoted to these study in measuring the spectra and chemical properties. In this thesis, calculations of the spectra and the hyperfine structure of some superheavy elements have been performed in an attempt to enrich our knowledge about the elements and even may help in their  detection.  We perform the high-precision relativistic calculations to determine the spectra of the superheavy element Z=119 (eka-Fr) and the singly-ionized superheavy element Z=120+ (eka-Ra+). Dominating correlation corrections beyond relativistic Hartree-Fock are included to all orders in the residual electron interaction using the Feynman diagram technique and the correlation potential method. The Breit interaction and quantum  electrodynamics radiative corrections are considered. Also, the volume isotope shift is determined.  We present the relativistic calculations for the energy levels of the superheavy element Z=120. The relativistic Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction techniques are employed. The correlations between core and valence electrons are treated by means of the correlation potential method and many-body perturbation theory.  We also try to address the absence of experimental data on the electron structure and energy spectrum of the Uub element (Z=112) by calculating its energy levels. The relativistic Hartree-Fock and configuration interaction methods are combined with the many-body perturbation theory to construct the many-electron wave function for valence electrons and to include core-valence correlations. The hyperfine structure constants of the lowest s and p1/2 states of superheavy elements Z=119 and Z= 120+ are calculated. Core polarization, dominating correlation, Breit and quantum electrodynamic effects are considered. The dependence of the hyperfine structure constants on nuclear radius is discussed. Measurements of the hyperfine structure combined with our calculations will allow one to study nuclear properties and distribution of magnetic moment inside nucleus.  Finally, we discuss the possibility of measuring nuclear anapole moments in atomic Zeeman transitions and perform the necessary calculations. Advantages of using Zeeman transitions include variable transition frequencies and the possibility of enhancement of parity nonconservation effects.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hyperfine structure</field><field name="subject">Superheavy elements</field><field name="subject">The spectra</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43734</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and genetic characterisation of iron acquisition by the coastal cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula (Oscillatoriales)</field><field name="creator">Salmon, Timothy Peter, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Large summertime proliferations (or blooms) of the noxious filamentous cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula have been observed in the coastal marine waters of Moreton Bay, Queensland. This photosynthetic organism is believed to have a high iron requirement and preliminary studies have shown that the presence of organically complexed iron stimulates growth. Since there is no evidence that Lyngbya produces siderophores to aid iron acquisition, it has been hypothesized that this organism may acquire iron via reduction of ferric complexes to the typically more labile, ferrous form.  Both the phylogenetic diversity of the genus Lyngbya and the iron metabolism of L. majuscula are examined in this thesis. Software was developed to assist in the design of peR primers that targeted l6S rRNA, rpoB and Highly Iterated Palindrome (HIP) genetic structures and the subsequent phylogenetic analysis. The mechanism of iron acquisition by L. majuscula and the influence of organic complexation of iron were investigated using radioisotope and chemiluminescence-based techniques. Molecular techniques were also used to investigate the genetics of iron metabolism of L. majuscula.  Results of the l6S rRNA analysis indicate that the morpho-genus Lyngbya encompasses a large genetic diversity within the cyanobacteria that is consistent with its reported metabolic and ecological diversity. Five discrete lineages comprised of organisms that fit the morophological definition of Lyngbya were discovered in this analysis. L. majuscula utilises endogenously-produced superoxide as a reductant of ferric complexes to produce the more labile ferrous forms. The nature of the organic complexes has been shown to determine the efficacy of this mechanism. A model of iron acquisition by these reductive processes was developed and was shown to generally describe all known methods of reduction-mediated iron acqUIsItIOn. Finally, the genetics of iron metabolism of L. majuscula was found to be consistent with the mechanism we propose, including the discovery of a component of a ferrous iron uptake mechanism.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria.</field><field name="subject">Iron -- Metabolism.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40725</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creative Music Making in Hong Kong Secondary Schools: The Present Situation and Professional Development of Music Teachers</field><field name="creator">Leung, Bo Wah, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Present research provides strong support for the use of creative activities in school music programmes based on evidence that learning music is more effective when students are exposed to authentic, experiential learning activities, rather than verbal descriptions and explanations by the teacher. Based on this background the purpose of this study was to address the need to train music teachers with the confidence and skills necessary to incorporate creative music making in their classroom teaching.  The study was divided into two phases. Phase I included a questionnaire survey that investigated the current situation of music teaching in Hong Kong secondary schools. To extend this survey three composers and three curriculum planners were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews in order to survey their opinions and suggestions on creative music making. Based on the literature review and findings from Phase I, Phase II focused on the design of a teacher education programme that would prepare teachers to undertake creative activities in their classroom music teaching.  The programme was trialled twice with two groups of in-service music teachers studying at the Hong Kong Institute of Education. The trainees were asked to design their own creative projects that were taught during a four-week Teaching Practice session. Findings reveal that the most effective creative projects possessed a logical teaching sequence, addressed students???? musical preferences, and integrated listening and performing activities with the creative task. Findings suggest that Hong Kong music teachers should adopt the techniques proposed in this study when designing and implementing their teaching programmes in order to nurture the musical creativity of their students. Music teacher education programmes in Hong Kong should also consider revising their modules so that they provide more balance between theory and practice, and integrate subject-based knowledge with pedagogical skills. A major conclusion of the study is that music teaching in Hong Kong secondary schools would benefited from a balance between creating, performing and listening activities where teachers apply a student-centred approach to expose their students to active, experiential and reflective learning environments in which creative musical expression is fostered at all levels of student development.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High schools -- China</field><field name="subject">School music -- Instruction and study -- China</field><field name="subject">Music teachers -- China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18665</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Precoder design and adaptive modulation for MIMO broadcast channels</field><field name="creator">Huang, Kuan Lun, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology, originated in the 1990s, is an emerging and fast growing area of communication research due to the ability to provide diversity as well as transmission degrees-of-freedom. Recent research focus on MIMO systems has shifted from the point-to-point link to the one-to-many multiuser links due to the ever increasing demand for multimedia-intensive services from users. The downlink of a multiuser transmission is called the broadcast channel (BC) and the reverse many-to-one uplink is termed the multiple access channel (MAC). Early studies in the MIMO BC and the MIMO MAC were mostly information-theoretic in nature. In particular, the characterizations of the capacity regions of the two systems were of primary concerns. The information-theoretic results suggest the optimal uplink detection scheme involves successive interference cancellation while successive application of dirty paper coding at the transmitter is optimal in the downlink channels.  Over the past few years, after the full characterizations of the capacity regions, several practical precoders had been suggested to realize the benefits of MIMO multiuser transmission. However, linear precoders such as the zero-forcing (ZF) and the MMSE precoders fall short on the achievable capacity despite their simple structure. Nonlinear precoders such as the ZF dirty paper (ZF-DP) and the the MMSE generalized decision feedback equalizer-type (MMSE-GDFE) precoders demonstrated promising performance but suffered from either restriction on the number of antennas at users, i.e. ZF-DP, or high computational load for the transmit filter, i.e. MMSE-GDFE. An novice MMSE feedback precoder (MMSE-FBP) with low computational requirement was proposed and its performance was shown to come very close to the bound suggested by information theory. In this thesis, we undertake investigation of the causes of the capacity inferiority and come to the conclusion that power control is necessary in a multiuser environment. New schemes that address the power control issue are proposed and their performances are evaluated and compared. Adaptive modulation is an effective and powerful technique that can increase the spectral efficiency in a fading environment remarkably. It works by observing the channel variations and adapts the transmission power and/or rate to counteract the instabilities of the channel. This thesis extends the pioneering study of adaptive modulation on single-input single-output (8180) Gaussian channel to the MIMO BC. We explore various combinations of power and rate adaptions and observe their impact on the system performance. In particular, we present analytical and simulation results on the successiveness of adaptive modulation in maximizing multiuser spectral efficiency. Furthermore, empirical research is conducted to validate its effectiveness in optimizing the overall system reliability.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">MIMO systems.</field><field name="subject">Coding theory.</field><field name="subject">Amplitude modulation.</field><field name="subject">Signal processing -- Digital techniques.</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Mobile communication systems.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40735</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The coal char-CO2 reaction at high temperature and pressure</field><field name="creator">Hodge, Elizabeth Marjorie, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Integrated gasification combined cycle is an advanced electricity generation technology, based on coal gasification. Wider deployment requires further research into the components of the process, including coal gasification. The coal gasification reactions are the slowest step in the gasifier and therefore determine size and operating conditions. Understanding the rate of the gasification reactions at high temperatures is crucial for accurate design and optimisation of the gasification process. While the rates have been measured at low temperature, limited data exist at the high temperatures and pressures relevant to entrained flow gasifiers. As the reactions are solid gas reactions, at high temperature they depend on both reaction rate and gas diffusion rate, which complicates the extrapolation of low temperature data. High temperature data measured thus far is only applicable to certain coals, as the gasification rates were not related to char properties. The aim of this thesis was to measure the high temperature gasification rates of three coal char samples and interpret the results in terms of the char morphology and intrinsic reactivity. The results showed that the gasification rate depended on both intrinsic reaction rate and diffusion rate under the experimental conditions. The majority of the char particles were very swollen, with high porosity and thin walls, whereas the conventional analysis approach assumes porous spherical particles. The effectiveness factor approach was modified to incorporate flat-plate geometry, and used to extract the intrinsic reaction rate from the gasification rate data, which showed that the intrinsic reaction rate could be extrapolated to higher temperatures. The application of the effectiveness factor for estimating the gasification rate was demonstrated, and the modified approach was found to give a better estimation of char gasification rate at high temperature. Accurate measurement of char wall thickness and porosity was identified for potential improvement of the approach.  Char conversion in a pilot-scale entrained flow gasifier was then explained in terms of char reaction rate, char morphology and reaction temperature, which showed the need for the development of more accurate models of char conversion in gasifiers, to which the work in this thesis can be applied.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High temperature</field><field name="subject">Coal</field><field name="subject">Gasification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43634</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Scheduling real-time traffic in wireless networks</field><field name="creator">Lee, Wingyee Emily, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation concerns the problem of scheduling real-time traffic in wireless TDMA channels. The most important characteristic of real-time traffic is that it has straight end-to-end delay constraint. We begin the investigation by studying a scheduling principle which naturally achieves the best delay performance in stationary channel conditions. Since the resulting scheduling algorithm maintains equal flow delays across the whole system, it is termed the equal-delay policy. There are a number of advantages associated with this scheduling method. First, it is very simple and practical to implement in real system. Secondly, it can be easily modelled mathematically and admits an analytical solution, which is very important for the construction of an admission control algorithm, we present a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the scheduling system, as well as devising a tractable analytical solution to the problem.  A third advantage of the equal-delay policy is that it can be easily extended to support flows with multiple delay constraints. We propose a multiple-class scheduling scheme based on similar allocation concepts as the equal-delay technique. The extended scheme can similarly be mathematically modelled and analytically characterized.  A natural objection to the above proposed techniques is that wireless transmission resources can be under-utilized, since the scheduling algorithm pays no attention to the changing individual channel conditions. The reduction in channel utilization can also adversely affect the delay performance, We explain this phenomenon and study the impacts for a variety of different channel characteristics, Specifically, we propose an alternative channel-aware scheduling policy, which aims to maximize channel utilization while keeping a minimum probability of delay violation, The proposed channel-aware policy achieves near-optimal delay performance. However, unlike in the equal-delay case, the channel-aware policy is not practical to implement in a real system. The complicated system dynamics associated with the channel-aware scheme also hamper the development of a mathematical model and analytical solution for admission control.  On the other hand, we observe from simulation results that under most circumstances, the equal-delay scheme achieves close to the pertonnance obtained by the channel-aware technique, With the additional benefits of simplicity and admitting analytical analysis. the equal-delay policy appears to be a more practical and suitable choice for scheduling real-time traffic in wireless networks.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems.</field><field name="subject">Scheduling -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Detection of alcohol-related emergency department presentations</field><field name="creator">Indig, Devon, National Drug &amp; Alcohol Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">People who consume alcohol at risky levels are at an increased risk of presenting to the emergency department (ED). There are a variety of methods used for detection of alcohol-related ED presentations but little guidance about the relative strengths and weaknesses for each method. This research compared and contrasted multiple detection methods for alcohol-related ED presentations and also examined the characteristics of ED patients identified as risky drinkers on a brief self-report screen compared with those detected as having an alcohol-related ED presentation.   The first study, a population health survey, found that high risk drinking, high psychological distress and current smoking were all significantly associated (both independently and when combined) with a greater likelihood of presenting to an ED in the last year. The second study involved electronically searching three years of ED nursing triage text data (N=263,937) for alcohol-related terms and found that over 5% of ED presentations were related to alcohol. The third study involved comparing a number of detection methods for alcohol-related ED presentations. It found that nearly a fifth (19%) of ED presentations were detected to be alcohol-related. The strongest method was a medical records audit (72%), followed by patient self-report (67%), nursing triage text (49%) then diagnostic codes (10%). Over a fourth of ED patients were identified as risky drinkers (28%), however, just over half (51%) of these did not present to the ED for an alcohol-related reason. Among alcohol-related ED presentations, nearly a third (31%) were not identified as risky drinkers. In a survey of ED staff, it was found that management of alcohol-related problems was not routine, and many staff appeared to lack the confidence to fully and appropriately manage ED patients with alcohol-related problems.  In summary, not all patients who have an alcohol-related ED presentation usually drink at risky levels, nor do all risky drinkers present to the ED for an alcohol-related reason. Using a variety of detection methods for alcohol-related problems in the ED is recommended to enhance the impact of any intervention strategies. ED staff require additional training, resources and support to enhance their management of patients with alcohol-related problems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Detection</field><field name="subject">Alcohol</field><field name="subject">Emergency department</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43684</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of consumer liking from trained sensory panel information: evaluation of artificial neural networks (ANN)</field><field name="creator">Krishnamurthy, Raju, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study set out to establish artificial neural networks (ANN) as an alternate to regression methods (multiple linear, principal components and partial least squares regression) to predict consumer liking from trained sensory panel data. The study has two parts viz., I) Flavour study - evaluation of ANNs to predict consumer flavour preferences from trained sensory panel data and 2) Fragrance study ??? evaluation of different ANN architectures to predict consumer fragrance liking from trained sensory panel data.  In this study, a multi-layer feedforward neural network architecture with input, hidden and output layer(s) was designed. The back-propagation algorithm was utilised in training of neural networks. The network learning parameters such as learning rate and momentum rate were optimised by the grid experiments for a fixed number of learning cycles.  In flavour study, ANNs were trained using the trained sensory panel raw data as well as transformed data. The networks trained with sensory panel raw data achieved 98% correct learning, whereas the testing was within the range of 28 -35%. A suitable transformation methods were applied to reduce the variations in trained sensory panel raw data. The networks trained with transformed sensory panel data achieved between 80-90% correct learning and 80-95% correct testing.  In fragrance study, ANNs were trained using the trained sensory panel raw data as well as principal component data. The networks trained with sensory panel raw data achieved 100% correct learning, and testing was in a range of 70-94%. Principal component analysis was applied to reduce redundancy in the trained sensory panel data. The networks trained with principal component data achieved about 100% correct learning and 90% correct testing.  It was shown that due to its excellent noise tolerance property and ability to predict more than one type of consumer liking using a single model, the ANN approach promises to be an effective modelling tool.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sensory evaluation -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Food -- Sensory evaluation -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Food -- Sensory evaluation -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Sensory evaluation -- Statistical methods.</field><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science) -- Industrial applications.</field><field name="subject">Consumers??? preferences -- Forecasting.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40746</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Properties of titanium matrix composites reinforced with titanium boride powders</field><field name="creator">Yuan, Fei (Fred), Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal matrix composites can produce mechanical and physical properties better than those of the monolithic metal. Titanium alloys are widely used matrix materials as they can offer outstanding specific strength, corrosion resistance and other advantages over its competitors, such as aluminium, magnesium and stainless steel. In past decades, titanium matrix composites served in broad areas, including aerospace, military, automobile and biomedical industries.  In this project, a revised powder metallurgy method, which contains cold isostatic pressing and hot isostatic pressing, was adopted to refine the microstructure of monolithic titanium. It was also used to manufacture titanium matrix composites. TiH2 powder was selected as the starting material to form Ti matrix and the reinforcements were sub-micron and nano-metric TiB particles.  Mechanical properties and microstructure of commercial titanium composites exhaust valves from Toyota Motor Corporation have been studied as the reference of properties of titanium composites manufactured in this project. It has been shown that tensile strength and hardness of exhaust valves increase about 30% than those of similar matrix titanium alloys. Examination on powder starting materials of this project was also carried out, especially the dehydrogenation process shown in the DSC result.  Mechanical properties and microstructures of titanium matrix composites samples in this project, as related to the process parameter, have also been investigated. The density of these samples reached 96% of theoretical one but cracks were found through out the samples after sintering. Fast heating rates during the processing was suspected to have caused the crack formation, since the hydrogen release was too fast during dehydrogenation. Hardness testing of sintered samples was carried out and the value was comparable and even better than that of commercial exhaust valves and titanium composites in literature. Microstructure study shows that the size of reinforcements increased and the size of grains decreased as the increasing amount of TiB reinforcements. And this condition also resulted in the increasing amount of the acicular alpha structure.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Metallic composites -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="subject">Metallic composites -- Fatigue.</field><field name="subject">Metallic composites -- Fracture.</field><field name="subject">Titanium -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="subject">Titanium alloys -- Fatigue.</field><field name="subject">Titanium alloys -- Fracture.</field><field name="subject">Titanium alloys -- Mechanical properties.</field><field name="subject">Powder metallurgy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40750</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems for a Kantian account of disputes over judgments of taste</field><field name="creator">Meadows, Toby Scougall, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we will be concerned with Kant's philosophy of beauty and with a particular area of interest which is of great importance to any practical theory of aesthetics: dispute.

In terms of cultural discourse, I investigate the adoption of English over the individual's native language, and by inference culture, as one's first language. In the area of social discourse, I look into the influence of nationalism in the context of Malaysia and Singapore.

Through the creative component, I strive to do two things: narrate a personal story and in it, portray aspects of social history. The critical essay provides explanations for a more cogent reading of the life story. In addition the essay brings another facet of understanding to the postcolonial experience, one from the Southeast Asian point of view.  Creative Component:  Across Three Languages, Two Lands: A Life Narrative is the life story of the protagonist, Leong Kah Yan. Yan was born into a traditional Cantonese/Chinese family and grew up in newly independent, post-colonial Malaysia, in the 1960s and 1970s. Being Chinese and educated in English resulted in her subsequent marginalisation when Malaysia switched to privileging the Malays in the country's version of nationalism. Her migration to Singapore in the late 1970s coincided with the country plunging into vigorous nation-building and brought questions of delineation between nation and self. In addition, there was also the personal struggle between the role of English and her native language and culture in her life. Coming to terms with all these factors brought resolution to a certain degree. With awareness that each factor had left an indelible mark on her identity, Van's reconciliation is a middle ground where the individual is comfortable amidst communal and nationalistic demands.

Given the presence of many discrete variables in typical governance studies, I argue that this method is superior to standard PCA that has been employed by others working in the area. Using a dataset of 244 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange in the year 2002-2003, I find that Pearson's correlations underestimate the strength of association between two variables, when at least one of them is discrete. Accordingly, standard PCA performed on the Pearson correlation matrix results in biased estimates. Applying discrete PCA on the polychoric correlation matrix, I extract from 28 corporate governance variables 10 significant factors. These factors represent 8 main aspects of the governance system, namely auditor reputation, large shareholder influence, size of board committees, social responsibility, risk optimisation, director independence level, female representation and institutional ownership. Finally, I investigate the relationship between corporate governance and a firm's long-run share market performance, with the former being the factors extracted. Consistent with Demsetz' (1983) argument, I document limited explanatory power for these governance factors.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Principal components analysis.</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40753</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessment of professionalism in undergraduate medical students</field><field name="creator">O'Sullivan, Anthony John, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates professionalism in undergraduate medical students. Professionalism is comprised of values and behaviours that underpin the contract between the public and the medical profession. Medical errors are reported to result in significant morbidity and are in-part related to underdeveloped professionalism. The aim was to determine whether aspects of professionalism were underdeveloped in medical students. A questionnaire with 24 clinical and medical student vignettes was taken by Year 2, 4, and 6 medical students from UNSW Medicine 3801 and their responses where compared to responses from practicing Clinical Academics. Second, fourth and sixth Year medical students' responses differed from Academics in two aspects of professionalism, firstly, high ethical and moral standards and secondly, humanistic values such as integrity and honesty.  A second component of this thesis was to determine whether student's responses to professionalism changed as they progressed through the medical program. Year 2 and 4 students had very similar responses except for the aspect responsibility and accountability. Similarly, the Year 2 and 6 students differed in only two of eight aspects of professionalism, that is, high ethical and moral standards and humanistic values and responsibility and accountability. These findings suggest that students' approaches to some aspects of professionalism do change slightly as they progress through a medical course, however there does not appear to be a clear decline or development of professionalism as a whole.  Responses from the Year 2, Medicine 3801 and Medicine 3802 (new medical program) medical students were compared and no statistically different responses. This finding would indicate that professional behaviour was very similar between these two groups of students.  Certain aspects of professionalism seem to be underdeveloped in medical students compared with Academics. These aspects of professionalism may need to be targeted for teaching and assessment in order that students develop as professionally responsible practitioners. In turn, students with well-developed professionalism may be less involved in medical error, and if involved they may have the personal values which can help them deal with error more honestly and effective.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical students.</field><field name="subject">Professional education.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40754</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Passive drainage and biofiltration of landfill gas: behaviour and performance in a temperate climate</field><field name="creator">Dever, Stuart Anthony, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microbial oxidation of methane has attracted interest as an alternative process for treating landfill gas emissions. Approaches have included enhanced landfill cover layers and biocovers, passive gas drainage and biofiltration, and active gas extraction and biofiltration. Previous research has shown that microbial methane oxidation is affected by a number of factors, many of which are dependent on the environment in which the process is occurring.  The aim of this research was to evaluate the behaviour and performance of a passive landfill gas drainage and biofiltration system operating in a temperate climate, and to identify and quantify the factors that determine the behaviour and performance of the system under such conditions. To achieve this a series of field trials were undertaken in Sydney, Australia, over a period of 4 years. The trials were designed to evaluate the effect of a range of factors, including landfill gas loading rate, temperature and moisture content of the biofilter media, biofilter media characteristics, and climatic conditions.  The results of the field trials showed that a passive gas drainage and biofiltration system operating in a temperate climate can achieve methane oxidation efficiencies &gt; 90% and that the behaviour and performance of a passive gas drainage and biofiltration system is primarily dependent on 3 factors: the landfill gas loading rate, which varies; the temperature of the biofilter media, which is affected by the temperature of the landfill gas being treated, the level of microbial activity occurring in the biofilter, and local climatic conditions; and the moisture conditions within of the biofilter media, which is affected by local climatic conditions and the characteristics of the biofilter media. Relationships between these factors and the performance of a passive biofilter operating in a temperate climate were developed, where able.  A number of design concepts for passive landfill gas drainage and biofiltration were developed. A process for assessing the feasibility of applying the concepts and designing a passive landfill gas drainage and biofiltration system was also developed. In addition, guidelines and recommendations for the design of a passive landfill gas drainage and biofiltration system operating in temperate climate were developed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microbial methane oxidation</field><field name="subject">Landfill gas</field><field name="subject">Biofiltration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43769</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of fouling behaviour on membrane filtration of aggregated suspensions</field><field name="creator">Kovalsky, Peter, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely accepted that flocculation improves filtration performance by increasing cake permeability. This principle is important in submerged membrane filtration for drinking water applications where the feed material can potentially contain fouling components which prohibit the extended operation of the filter. Less well understood is the impact of floc properties on the hydraulic properties of the fouling layer formed on the membrane or the impact of hydrodynamic conditions during treatment on the floc-fouling layer relationship. In order to advance knowledge of this area, a set of tools were developed to characterise the cake formed during constant pressure filtration in terms of the compressive yield stress and permeability as a function of solid volume fraction. Using an iterative procedure, the optimal parameters for these models are calculated as are pressure and solid fraction distribution profiles. Input parameters to the numerical analysis are flux and final cake height data obtained from batch filtration experiments which are driven to steady state. The calculated material properties are compared against piston and centrifuge data with good agreement. Application of the material properties to constant flux filtration involved development of a numerical model for simultaneous consolidation and cake formation. Flocculated yeast was used as the test system with the predicted transmembrane pressure rise as a function of time under constant flux conditions compared with experimental data. Good agreement is observed between model and experimental trends. The close correspondence between experimental and predicted results also suggests that it may be possible to predict trans-membrane pressure rise during constant flux filtration on the basis of material properties determined through simple constant pressure steady state experiments. A good account of the data was also achieved through extension of the general equation to include an empirical model for the consolidation time constant. These new tools were applied to characterise the cakes formed under well controlled shear conditions. To avoid complications with modeling the sheared filtration system, the filtration was performed below the critical shear rate for particle rejection. This was verified by in-situ particle counts and size measurement. The material properties were determined for flocculated yeast filtered in a coni-cylindrical Couette at several shear rates below the critical shear. Comparison of the compressive yield stress showed that cakes subjected to shear required less compressive stress to collapse. It is shown that the general equation for constant flux could be modified to encompass this effect through inclusion of an empirical shear parameter. The transmembrane pressure rise is able to be described well by this model. DEM particle simulation was performed to investigate the effect of floc size and structure on cake permeability. Flocs of known size and structure were placed in a virtual suspension and the process of consolidation simulated by application of a compressive force. The permeability of the cake was calculated by computational fluid dynamics at various stages of the consolidation showing that the larger compact floc showed the highest permeability despite the highly compact structures formed. Comparison of pore size distribution also confirmed that several larger pores remained after consolidation of the larger compact flocs. Further work needs to be undertaken to pin point the microstructural mechanism governing this behaviour and whether the presence of fluid passing through these pores under normal filtration flows affects the retention of permeability of cakes under compression. Furthermore, the shear environment required to minimise the detrimental effects caused by shear enhanced cake collapse and also to form flocs of compact structure and large size needs to investigated.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shear</field><field name="subject">Flocculation</field><field name="subject">Filtration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41531</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Organisational learning and information systems : an exploration from a sensemaking perspective.</field><field name="creator">Jap, Tji-Beng, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the relationship between information systems (IS) and organisational learning. The literature suggests that IS implementation and use can affect and stimulate organisational learning, including higher order learning. However, it is not well understood when and how IS enable and support and when they disable and prevent organisational learning. Furthennore, studies of the relationship between IS and organisational learning tend to reflect theoretical fragmentation of organisational learning literature - focusing either on the individual or on the organisation as a learning entity.  The objective of this thesis is to explore the relationship between IS and organisational learning beyond these limitations, including different learning views from the individual up to the organizational. This is achieved by drawing from a Sensemaking perspective of organizations (Weick, 1995) that fills an important gap in linking infonnation systems, organizing, and learning. The Sensemaking perspective offers an understanding of human sensemaking and sense-'unmaking' as an essential individual, collective and organisational ingredient of organising and learning. By integrating Argyris and Sch??n' s (1978) theory of organisational learning with the sensemaking model of organizations this thesis suggests a more comprehensive view to explore the relationship between IS and organisational learning. Specifically this thesis examines the following research question: What are the ways and mechanisms by which information systems' implementation and use engage sensemaking in organisations, and how does such engagement engender or prevent organisational learning? This research question is investigated through an interpretive, longitudinal case study of the implementation and use of a loan approval information system in a large South-East Asian Bank. The study involved an extensive collection of data from the Bank headquarters and its branches, including 43 interviews, strategic and operational documents, IS project documents and informal discussions. The thesis makes two important contributions to knowledge. Grounded in empirical data, it first argues that the emergence of organizational learning when instigated by an IS implementation is likely to follow the pattern from 'not learning', to 'single-loop' to 'double-loop' learning. Secondly, it also proposes that an IS's likelihood to instigate organizational learning depends on the nature of sensemaking involved: a) if an IS implementation engages only individual, intra-subjective sensemaking organizational learning is not likely to occur and system is at risk of being rejected; b) for single-loop learning to emerge the engagement of intra- and inter-subjective sensemaking, mutually intertwined during an IS implementation, is required, and c)the change of mindset and double-loop learning can be achieved through the interplay of all sensemaking processes (intra, inter, generic-subjective and extra-subjective) in an IS implementation. This thesis puts to the test and demonstrates the value of the Sensemaking approach to the understanding of the relationship between IS implementation and organisational learning.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Strategic planning.</field><field name="subject">Management information systems</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44497</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visual dataflow language for image processing</field><field name="creator">Le, Hoang Duc Khanh, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Most current DFVPLs support flow control to facilitate experiments and complex problems. However, current approaches in DFVPLs still remain inefficient. We show that inadequacies in existing visual programming languages may be magnified in applications involving image analysis. These include a lack of efficient communication mechanisms and strong dependency on human involvement to customise properties. For instance, properties in one computational component can not be shared for other components. Moreover, conditional expressions used in control components hold data values that are unrelated with those computational components. Furthermore, since image processing libraries usua.lly only explicitly support pipeline processing, as exemplified by the widely used Insight Toolkit for Medical Image Segmentation and Registration (ITK), a looping algorithm would be difficult to implement without a feedback mechanism supported by the visual language itself.  We propose a data-flow visual programming language that encompasses several novel control constructs and parameterised computational units. These components are facilitated by a novel hybrid data-flow model. We also present several conceptual models and design alternatives for control constructs. Several mechanisms and techniques are provided to enhance data propagation for these components. We demonstrate, in an environment that utilises ITK as the underlying processing engine, that the inadequacies in existing DFVPLs can be satisfactorily addressed through the visual components proposed in this thesis.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual programming languages (Computer science)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Comparative analysis of atypical coordinate structures in Russian and English languages in correlation with field structure of grammatical category coordination</field><field name="creator">Osborne, Olga, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines specific features of atypical coordinate structures (from now referred to as ACS) in both English and Russian languages: those features which differentiate ACS from typical coordinate structures, but nevertheless allow them to keep the status of coordinate structures. Comparing ACS with typical coordinate structures in terms of linguistic norms, this thesis provides a view of ACS as less standard, non-normative forms of syntactic representations of coordinate relations.  Most research on coordinate structures focuses either on syntax, or on semantics. This dissertation advocates the expediency of a functional-dynamic approach to ACS, applying the methods of linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive linguistics and social linguistics. It argues that coordination is a complex speech-thinking mechanism and that ACS should be analysed by taking into account the cognitive-pragmatic-emotive intentions of the speaker. This dissertation proposes the analysis of structure, semantics and pragmatics of ACS in correlation with their functioning in a text.  For the first time the thesis provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of ACS in English and Russian languages. This analysis demonstrates that the syntactically comparable translation of the majority of ACS from English to Russian and vice versa is possible due to the same factors involved in the process of ACS formation in both languages. It also shows that the absence of the same coordinate structure of idiomatic character in the other language makes the adequate translation impossible.  This dissertation argues that all types of coordinate structures have the same invariant meaning of MULTITUDE, but syntactically this meaning is represented differently by typical and atypical coordinate structures. The result of the comparative analysis is the proposal of a nucleus-peripheral structure of coordination which represents the diversity of coordinate structures. In the nucleus-peripheral structure typical coordinate structures represent the nucleus and have prototypical status, whereas ACS represent the periphery; different types of ACS are arranged at different distances from the nucleus depending on how many common properties they share with prototypical structures. The fact that this structure can be applied to both English and Russian languages advocates for the common principles of coordinate structures formation mechanism in these otherwise unrelated languages.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43738</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corrosion behaviour of aluminised steel and conventional alloys in simulated aluminium smelting cell environments</field><field name="creator">Xu, Nan, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aluminium smelting is a high temperature electrometallurgical process, which suffers considerable inefficiencies in power utilization and equipment maintenance.  Aluminium smelting cell works in the extreme environments that contain extraordinarily aggressive gases, such as HF, CO and SO2.  Mild steel used as a structural material in the aluminium industry, can be catastrophically corroded or oxidized in these conditions.  This project was mainly concerned with extending the lifetime of metal structures installed immediately above the aluminium smelting cells.  An aluminium-rich coating was developed on low carbon steel A06 using pack cementation technique.  Yttria (Y2O3) was also used to improve the corrosion resistance of coating.  Kinetics of the coating formation were studied.  XRD, FESEM and FIB were employed to investigate the phase constitution and the surface morphology.  Together with other potentially competitive materials, aluminium-rich coating was evaluated in simulated plant environments.  Results from the long time (up to 2500h) isothermal oxidation of materials at high temperature (800??C) in air showed that the oxidation resistance of coated A06 is close to that of stainless steel 304 and even better than SS304 in cyclic oxidation tests.  Coated A06 was also found to have the best sulfidation resistance among the materials tested in the gas mixture contains SO2 at 800??C.  Related kinetics and mechanisms were also studied.  The superior corrosion resistance of the coated A06 is attributed to the slow growing alpha-Al2O3 formed.  Low temperature corrosion tests were undertaken in the gas mixtures containing air, H2O, HCl and SO2 at 400??C.  Together with SS304 and 253MA, coated A06 showed excellent corrosion resistance in all the conditions.  The ranking of the top three materials for corrosion resistance is: 253MA, coated A06 and SS304.  It is believed that aluminised A06 is an ideal and economical replacement material in the severe corrosive aluminium smelting cell environment.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aluminium smelting cell</field><field name="subject">pack cementation process</field><field name="subject">iron aluminde</field><field name="subject">high temperature oxidation</field><field name="subject">high temperature sulfidation</field><field name="subject">chlorination</field><field name="subject">kinetics</field><field name="subject">aluminum coatings</field><field name="subject">steel -- corrosion</field><field name="subject">corrosion resistant materials</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Split-attention in reading comprehension: a case of English as a foreign/second language</field><field name="creator">Cong Minh Huynh, Hung, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent research on the role, the development, and the effectiveness of reading comprehension instructions has provided substantial results concerning the methodology of teaching foreign languages.

This document outlines a standardised model to calculate a duration-based proxy for IRR in depository institution balance sheets. We utilise this methodology to define an IRR measure which we denote BIRRM (Basel Interest Rate Risk Measure). It is the change in the value of a financial institution produced by a 200 basis-point increase in interest rates at all maturities, relative to Tier I and Tier II capital.  This study has three primary objectives. Firstly, we utilise BIRRM to provide an overview of IRR exposure of Australian Credit Unions and Building Societies (CUBS) over the period September 1997 to September 2007. Secondly, we seek an understanding of the relationship between BIRRM and measures of CUBS' interest rate sensitivity over a period of rising interest rates (December 1998 to September 2000) and another period of falling rates (September 2000 to December 2001). Finally, we seek an understanding of the economic factors that influence IRR exposure decisions of CUBS by modelling the determinants of CUBS' IRR exposure.  We find that IRR exposure of CUBS is relatively low and, on average, CUBS are exposed to falling interest rates. We also find significant relationships between BIRRM and measures of CUBS' interest rates sensitivity consistent with a priori expectations, supporting the use of the Basel Committee's measure of IRR in identifying CUBS with large IRR exposures. The models examining the determinants of CUBS' IRR have relatively low explanatory power. There are however significant relationships between a number of factors and CUBS' exposure to changing rates.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interest rate risk</field><field name="subject">Credit unions -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stereo imaging and obstacle detection methods for vehicle guidance</field><field name="creator">Zhao, Jun, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With modern day computer power, developing intelligent vehicles is fast becoming a reality. An Intelligent Vehicle is a vehicle equipped with sensors and computing that allow it to perceive the world around it, and to decide on appropriate action.  Vision cameras are a good choice to sense the environment. One key task of the camera in an intelligent vehicle is to detect and localise the obstacles, which is the preparation of path planning. Stereo vision based obstacle detection is used in this research. It does not analyse semantic meaning of image features, but directly measures the 3-D coordinates of image pixels, and thus is suitable for obstacle detection in an unknown environment. In this research, a novel correlation based stereo vision method is developed which greatly improves its accuracy while maintaining its real-time performance.  Since a vision system provides a large amount of data, extracting refined information may sometimes be complex. In obstacle detection tasks, the purpose is to distinguish the obstacle pixels from the ground pixels in the disparity image. V-Disparity image approach is used in this research to detect the ground plane, however this approach relies heavily on sufficient road features. In this research, a correlation method to locate the ground plane in the disparity image, even without significant road features, is developed. Moreover, traditional V-Disparity images have difficulties detecting non-flat ground, thus having limited applications. This research also develops a method to detect non-flat ground using V-Disparity images, thus greatly widening its application.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vehicle guidance</field><field name="subject">stereo vision</field><field name="subject">obstacle detection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43608</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The exchange of oxygen at the surface of open waters under wind forcing</field><field name="creator">Walker, James William, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A series of detailed laboratory investigations were conducted to examine low solubility gas transfer across wind-forced wavy air-water interfaces.  The study focuses on the increase in gas flux associated with the microphysical interfacial wind momentum exchange and the complex wave coupled hydrodynamics.  Key elements of the laboratory investigations included the measurement of hydrodynamic behaviour within the aqueous viscous sub-layer using a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system and the development of a Laser Induced Fluorescent (LIF) system capable of measuring reliable dissolved oxygen concentration profiles to within 28??m of the air-water interface.  Major achievements and findings included: 1.	The first phase resolved gas flux measurements along wind forced microscale waves, indicating the highest mean gas fluxes are located in the wave troughs.  This finding demonstrated the relative importance of wave orbital straining in gas flux enhancement; a wave coupled hydrodynamic process whose significance has previously been neglected. 2.	 The relative contributions to gas flux from wind shear, wave orbital straining, increased surface area of the waves, parasitic capillary ripples and microscale breaking are quantified with respect to friction velocity, wave steepness and an efficiency of microscale wave breaking.  The parasitic capillary ripples are shown to have a negligible role in gas enhancement.  A hybrid model is developed to estimate the gas flux based on both wind and wave characteristics. 3.	Gas enhancement due to microscale wave breaking and the significance of the highly localised subduction at the toe of the spilling region on the leeward face of the wave crests was investigated using data from the LIF experiments.  The highly localised subduction was shown to substantially reduce the thickness of the diffusion sub-layer, resulting in an increase in gas flux when waves transitioned from the incipient breaking to the microscale breaking wave form.    4.	Consideration of previously unidentified optical distortions in LIF imagery due to non-linear effects is presented that is critical for robust LIF data processing and experimental design.  A formal mathematical description of optical distortions has been developed and presented.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">surface gas flux</field><field name="subject">LIF</field><field name="subject">PIV</field><field name="subject">wave kinematics</field><field name="subject">oxygen exchange</field><field name="subject">air-water interface</field><field name="subject">boundary layer</field><field name="subject">diffusion sub-layer</field><field name="subject">viscous sub-layer</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43712</field></doc><doc><field name="title">On semiparametric regression and data mining</field><field name="creator">Ormerod, John T, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Semiparametric regression is playing an increasingly large role in the analysis of datasets exhibiting various complications (Ruppert, Wand &amp; Carroll, 2003). In particular semiparametric regression a plays prominent role in the area of data mining where such complications are numerous (Hastie, Tibshirani &amp; Friedman, 2001). In this thesis we develop fast, interpretable methods addressing many of the difficulties associated with data mining applications including: model selection, missing value analysis, outliers and heteroscedastic noise.  We focus on function estimation using penalised splines via mixed model methodology (Wahba 1990; Speed 1991; Ruppert et al. 2003). In dealing with the difficulties associated with data mining applications many of the models we consider deviate from typical normality assumptions. These models lead to likelihoods involving analytically intractable integrals. Thus, in keeping with the aim of speed, we seek analytic approximations to such integrals which are typically faster than numeric alternatives.  These analytic approximations not only include popular penalised quasi-likelihood (PQL) approximations (Breslow &amp; Clayton, 1993) but variational approximations. Originating in physics, variational approximations are a relatively new class of approximations (to statistics) which are simple, fast, flexible and effective. They have recently been applied to statistical problems in machine learning where they are rapidly gaining popularity (Jordan, Ghahramani, Jaakkola &amp; Sau11999; Corduneanu &amp; Bishop, 2001; Ueda &amp; Ghahramani, 2002; Bishop &amp; Winn, 2003; Winn &amp; Bishop 2005).  We develop variational approximations to: generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs); Bayesian GLMMs; simple missing values models; and for outlier and heteroscedastic noise models, which are, to the best of our knowledge, new. These methods are quite effective and extremely fast, with fitting taking minutes if not seconds on a typical 2008 computer.  We also make a contribution to variational methods themselves. Variational approximations often underestimate the variance of posterior densities in Bayesian models (Humphreys &amp; Titterington, 2000; Consonni &amp; Marin, 2004; Wang &amp; Titterington, 2005). We develop grid-based variational posterior approximations.

The major findings were: gay Asian men tended to experience conflict, in being both gay and Asian, related to individualism and collectivism; the gay Asian and Caucasian men differed in various aspects of homosexual practice, but shared certain sexual traits and practices; self-efficacy in safe sex and gay community attachment were key factors associated with gay men???s sexual risk practices (???risk??? being defined as unprotected anal intercourse with any casual partners or with a regular partner whose HIV status was not concordant with the participant???s).  This study provides evidence that the inclusion of individualism-collectivism, social cognitive variables and gay community factors in the examination of homosexual identity and practice among men of different cultural backgrounds holds promise.  It further suggests that educational programs to encourage safe sex will continue to yield benefits from increasing individual awareness, confidence and ability to effectively deal with situations that could pose risks of HIV transmission.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV/AIDS</field><field name="subject">Homosexuality male</field><field name="subject">cross-cultural differences</field><field name="subject">Self-efficacy</field><field name="subject">Gay men</field><field name="subject">Sexual behavior</field><field name="subject">Minority gays</field><field name="subject">Asians</field><field name="subject">Interviews</field><field name="subject">Safe sex in AIDS prevention</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Sexual behavior surveys</field><field name="subject">Individualism</field><field name="subject">Collectivism</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A universe of sky and snow: site-testing for optical astronomy at Dome C, Antarctica</field><field name="creator">Kenyon, Suzanne Laura, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The unique advantages for astronomy on the Antarctic plateau are now well established. In particular, Dome C, Antarctica is potentially one of the best new sites for optical, infrared and sub-millimeter astronomy, presenting the opportunity to build unique astronomical instruments. Located high on the Antarctic plateau, Dome C offers low wind, clear skies, and negligible precipitation. This thesis addresses three additional properties of the site relevant to optical astronomy-sky brightness, atmospheric extinction and optical turbulence.  The sky at an optical astronomy site must be dark, and the atmosphere very clean with minimal light extinction. At present little is known from an astronomer's perspective about the optical sky brightness and atmospheric extinction at most Antarctic sites. The high latitude of Dome C means that the Sun spends a relatively small amount of time far below the horizon, implying longer periods of astronomical twilight and less optical dark time than other sites, especially those close to the equator. We review the contributions to sky brightness at high-latitude sites, and calculate the amount of usable dark time at Dome C. We also explore the implications of the limited sky coverage of high-latitude sites, and review optical extinction data from the South Pole. A proposal to extend the amount of usable dark time through the use of polarising filters is examined, and we present the design and calibration of an instrument (called Nigel) to measure the brightness, spectrum and temporal characteristics of the twilight and night sky.  The atmospheric turbulence profile above an astronomical site limits the achievable resolution and sensitivity of a telescope. The atmospheric conditions above high plateau Antarctic sites are different to temperate sites; the boundary layer of turbulence is confined very close to the surface, and the upper atmosphere turbulence very weak. We present the first winter-time turbulence profiles of the atmosphere above Dome C, and characterise the site in terms of the achievable precision for photometry and astrometry, and the isoplanatic angle and coherence time for the adaptive optics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Astronomy -- Antarctica.</field><field name="subject">Astronomical instruments -- Antarctica.</field><field name="subject">Astronomical observatories -- Antarctica.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40822</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of a worked example approach in group work settings during mathematics learning</field><field name="creator">Retnowati, Endah , Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Research has shown that worked examples are superior to problem solving in many domains, particularly for novices. However, most research has only been conducted in individualised learning environments, despite a large body of literature indicating that learning can be effective in groups.  This experiment aimed to engage students in a group work activity using worked examples or problems in geometry learning and compared the effect of the two approaches on numeric and reasoning abilities using both near and far transfer tests. Whether learning in a group work setting is beneficial compared with individual setting was also examined. One hundred and one Year 7 students were randomly allocated into four experimental groups: (I) problem solving in an individual setting; (2) worked examples in an individual setting; (3) problem solving during group work; (4) worked examples during group work. Each group received three consecutive instructional learning phases: worked example study, group work skill induction and an acquisition stage. Numeric and reasoning abilities of all groups using both near and far transfer tests were measured and analysed by 2 x 2 MANOVAs. A questionnaire was distributed to obtain information on students' interaction intensity and their impression of the learning activities.  The results indicated a significant superiority of the worked example approach in both the individual and group work setting for numeric and reasoning abilities and most students stated that they preferred this study approach. The questionnaire data on interaction intensity revealed that the worked example condition fostered interaction between participants as much as the problem solving condition, nevertheless, a possible interaction effect was found favouring the group work condition under worked example conditions. This experiment adds evidence on the benefits of a worked example approach but does not suggest group work is advantageous. The group work effects are discussed using a cognitive load theory perspective.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group work in education</field><field name="subject">Mathematics</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40827</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Synthesis of new heterocyclic structures based on indoles</field><field name="creator">Somphol, Kittiya, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Novel indolo-macrocycles have been generated from the attempts to synthesise bis-indolo-cyclotriveratrylenes by the condensation of I, I'-diindolyl-3,3'-dimethanols catalysed by p-toluenesulfonic acid. The addition of substituents on indoles led to enhanced solubilities of the macrocycles.  Nine- and six-membered ring compounds have been synthesized from the acid-catalysed reaction of I,I'-diindolyl compounds and aryl aldehydes. Some reactions of these compounds and the attempted synthesis of 2,2' diindolylmethanes from the cyclic compounds have also been described.  The electrophilic substitution reactions of 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindole 2,6-dimethanols and 3-substituted 4,6-dimethoxyindole-7 and 2-carbaldehydes and I-substituted indoles afforded triindolyl dialdehydes. The wriation of substituents at C-7 of indole-7-aldehydes and at C-2 of indole-2-aldehydes has also been discussed. Reaction of the hydroxymethylindole and 1,2-di(indol-I-ylmethyl)benzene gave a new macrocycle. Substitution reactions of 2,2???-diindolylmethane-7,7'-dimethanol and indole-7- and 2-aldehydes gave tetraindolyl dialdehydes.

An initial set of composites was prepared from as-received tire crumb and HDPE recyclate containing 040% tire crumb in 10% increments, using injection moulding. The elastic modulus and tensile strength were found to decrease linearly with increasing tire crumb content. Addition of tire crumb to recycled HDPE caused produced an immediate reduction in the strain to failure with a progressively more modest decrease as the tire crumb content was increased. The impact toughness decreased more linearly with increasing tire crumb fraction. Cross sections of the composites showed that the tire crumb particles were in intimate contact with the matrix but post mortem examination of the fracture surface of the impact test specimens indicated that the level of bonding had been poor.  A second set of composites was a prepared from 10% tire crumb. The tire crumb was first given an oxidative treatment in hot aqueous copper chloride at concentrations from 0-5 wt% Cu Ch at 50 or 100??C for 6 or 12 hours. The composites were injection moulded with an addition of 0.5 wt% dicumyl peroxide (DCP). These composites showed good bonding between the tire crumb and the recycled HDPE even at concentrations of 0% of the Cu 2+ oxidation catalyst. The addition of DCP was found to substantially reduce the modulus of neat HDPE and this reduction was reflected in the modulus of the composites. It was found that the DCP concentration could be reduced to 0.02% without adversely affecting the composites.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tires, Rubber -- Recycling.</field><field name="subject">Rubber -- Recycling.</field><field name="subject">Rubber -- Compounding.</field><field name="subject">Polyethylene.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) (Macropodidae: Marsupialia) in the Northern Jarrah Forest of Australia</field><field name="creator">Hayward, Matt, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The quokka (Setonix brachyurus Quoy &amp; Gaimard 1830) is a medium-sized, macropodid marsupial that is endemic to the mesic, south-western corner of Australia.  While being a tourist icon on Rottnest Island, the species is threatened with extinction.  It has been intensively studied on Rottnest Island in the 1960s and 1970s, however very little is known of its ecology on the mainland.  Additionally the insular and mainland environments are extremely different suggesting that ecological differences between the two populations are likely.  Consequently, this study sought to determine the basic autecology of the quokka and identify what factors have attributed to its threatened conservation status.  The northern jarrah forest of Western Australia was selected as the study region due to it being at the northern limit of extant quokka distribution and because it was thought that the factors threatening the quokka would be exacerbated there. Fossil deposits suggest that the quokka originally occupied an area of approximately 49,000 km2 in the south-western corner of Australia.  Historical literature show that they were widespread and abundant when Europeans colonised the region in 1829 but a noticeable and dramatic decline occurred a century later.  The arrival of the red fox to the region coincided almost exactly with this decline and so it was probably ultimately responsible.  Continued predation by both it and the feral cat are likely to have continued the decline, along with habitat destruction and modification through altered fire regimes.  Specific surveys and literature searches show that since the 1950s, the area occupied by the quokka has declined by 45% and since 1990 by 29%.  Based on the criteria of the IUCN (Hilton-Taylor 2000), the conservation status of the quokka should remain as vulnerable.  An endangered status may be more applicable if the quokkas restriction to patches through its existence as a metapopulation is considered. Trapping of eight sites supporting quokka populations in the mid-1990s revealed three sites now locally extinct despite the ongoing, six year old, fox control programme.  Another three are at serious risk of extinction.  Extant population sizes ranged from one to 36 and population density ranged from 0.07 to 4.3 individuals per hectare.  This is considered to be below the carrying capacity of each site. The overall quokka population size in the northern jarrah forest may be as low as 150 adult individuals, of which half are likely to be female.  Even the largest extant populations are highly susceptible to stochastic extinction events.  This small size was surprising considering the six year old, introduced predator control programme. Historically, the restriction to discrete habitat patches, the occasional inter-patch movement, the lack of correlation between the dynamics of each population and reports of frequent localised extinctions and colonisations suggest that the quokka population once existed as part of a classic metapopulation.  The massive decline of the quokka in the 1930s pushed the metapopulation structure into a non-equilibrium state such that today, the extant populations are the terminal remnants of the original classic metapopulation. Wild mainland quokkas breed throughout the year.  A significant reduction in the number of births occurs over summer and this coincides with a decline in female body weight.  Despite this, the mainland quokka is relatively fecund and is able to wean two offspring per year.  The level of recruitment from pouch young to independence was low and this may explain the apparent lack of population increase following the initiation of fox control.  A total of 56 trapped quokkas were fitted with a radio collar.  Mean home range size for quokkas was 6.39 ha with a core range of 1.21 ha and this was negatively related to population density.  Male home ranges were larger than females but not significantly when the sexual size dimorphism was considered.  Nocturnal ranges were larger than diurnal ranges reflecting nocturnal departures from the swamp refugia.  Home range sizes varied seasonally, probably due to changes in the distance required to move to obtain sufficient nutrients and water over the dry summer compared to the wet winter and spring.  Telemetry confirmed trapping results that showed no movement between swamps or populations.  Home range centres shifted to the periphery of the swamp following the winter inundation and this may increase the species susceptibility to predation.  The lack of dispersal is probably caused by quokka populations existing below carrying capacity and following selection for philopatry under the threat of predation for dispersing individuals.  Without dispersal to recolonise or rescue unpopulated patches, the collapse of the original quokka metapopulation appears to have occurred.  On a macrohabitat scale, the quokka in the northern jarrah forest is restricted to Agonis swamp shrubland habitats that form in the open, upper reaches of creek systems on the western side of the forest.  This restriction was probably initially due to the high water requirements of the quokka but is likely to have been exacerbated by increased predation pressure since the arrival of the fox.  On a microhabitat scale, the quokka is a habitat specialist, preferring early seral stage swamp habitats, probably for foraging, as part of a mosaic of old age swamp that provides refuge. Despite the six year old, introduced predator control programme, foxes and cats are still the major cause of mortality to quokkas.  Road kills was the other identifiable cause.  Individuals alive at the start of the study had an 81% chance of staying alive until the end.  The likelihood of dying was minimised by grouping together with conspecifics, maximising home range size and maximising the time spent within the swampy refuge.  Current rates of adult and juvenile survivorship should allow population recovery and so it seems pouch young mortality, reflected by low recruitment, has inhibited the anticipated population increase following predator control. The confounding effect of inadequate unbaited controls meant that little statistical evidence was available on the impact of introduced predators on the quokka, however the models provided support for earlier hypotheses of these.  The presence of a quokka population at a site was related to the amount of poison baits delivered ??? reflecting predation pressure, the average age of the swamp and a mosaic of early and late seral stages within the swamp habitat.  Recently burnt habitat is thought to provide food for quokkas and long unburnt habitat provides refuge from predation.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Northern Jarrah Forest Reserve</field><field name="subject">quokka</field><field name="subject">Setonix brachyurus</field><field name="subject">Macropodidae</field><field name="subject">Marsupialia</field><field name="subject">Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/18768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of T cells and cytokines in the induction of tolerance to renal tubular antigen in active Heymann nephritis</field><field name="creator">Ha, Hong, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Idiopathic Membranous nephropathy (MN) is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in humans, and many patients progress to end-stage kidney disease. The best available animal model of MN is active Heymann nephritis (HN) in which rats are immunized with renal tubular antigen (RTA) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Rats develop heavy proteinuria, a key measure of glomerular damage, and the disease is histologically identical to human MN. It has been thought that HN is mediated by antibody-based mechanisms. More recent evidence demonstrates a critical role for cytotoxic T cells. This thesis aims to further examine the role of T cell responses in active HN.  First, the effect of the anti-CD3 monocIonal antibody (mAb) G4.18 was investigated. Anti-CD3 given 4 weeks after immunization prevented the development of proteinuria, delayed anti-RTA antibody responses, and reduced glomerular infiltration of CD8+ T cells and macrophages, but did not affect glomerular deposition of IgG or complement. Increased mRNA expression of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 was detected in draining lymph nodes. These findings suggest that immune deviation to a Th2 response reduces glomerular injury in HN.   Second, the role of CD4+ T cells in immune tolerance was examined. Rats were given RTA in incomplete Freund's adjnvant (lFA) to induce tolerance to RTA, and three weeks later were immunized with RTA in CFA. Anti-CD4 mAb therapy at the time of RTA1IFA treatment had no effect on subsequent proteinuria or anti-RTA autibodies. Third, the role of IL-4 in this model of immune tolerance was examined. Anti-IL-4 mAb therapy blocked the induction of tolerance, and led to the development of proteinuria. Finally, the effect of treatment with IL-4 and IL-5 was examined. Treatment with these cytokines separately or together after immunization blocked the development of proteinuria, without a consistent effect on anti-RTA antibodies.  These results demonstrate a central role for T cell regulation in HN, and show that immune deviation to a Th2 response is protective against glomerular injury. The findings may have implications in the future for focused therapeutic intervention in human idiopathic MN.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">T cells.</field><field name="subject">Kidneys -- Diseases -- Animal models.</field><field name="subject">Cytokines -- Inhibitors.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40871</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeted alpha therapy for epithelial ovarian cancer</field><field name="creator">Song, Emma Yanjun, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: Control of micrometastatic ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity remains a major objective in post-surgical treatment. The purpose of this project was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of targeted alpha therapy (TAT) for ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo in animal models and to select the optimal targeting vector for an ovarian cancer clinical trial. Animal models of ovarian, breast and prostate cancer were developed and for further TAT; a phase I melanoma clinical trial was supported, paving the way for an ovarian cancer clinical trial.  Methods: The expression of the turnor-associated antigens (Her2, MUC1, uPAfuPAR) on cancer cell line, animal model xenografts and human ovarian cancer tissue was tested by immunostaining. MTS and TUNEL assays were used to evaluate cell killing of alpha conjugates in monolayer and spheroids. Toxicity and maximum tolerance doses for different vectors were tested and determined in vivo. Pharmacokinetics was studied for different time points and different parameters. The antiproliferative effect of 213Bi-C595 and 213Bi-PAI2 was tested at 9 days post-peritoneal cell inoculation of the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR3. The treatment efficacy of 213Bi-Herceptin was tested at a 2 days post-subcutaneous breast cancer cell BT474 inoculation. Mice were injected (i.p) with various concentrations of alpha conjugates (AC). Changes in cancer progression were assessed by girth size and tumor size.  Results: uPA/uPAR and MUCI are expressed on ovarian cancer cell lines and more than 45% ovarian cancer tissue, while HER2 was only positive in one cell line and was positive in less than 15% of ovarian cancer tissues. The ACs can target and kill cancer cells in vitro in a dose dependent fashion. TUNEL positive cells were found after incubation with the different ACs. PAI2 and C595 vectors were selected for in vivo ascites model study of OVCARJ cell with high expression. Delayed and acute toxicity in animal models showed that radiation nephropathy was the cause of body weight loss. Biodistribution studies showed that kidney was the major uptake organ. L-lysine can reduce kidney uptake for 213Bi-PAI2, but no significant differences were found. A single ip injection of 213Bi-C595 or 213Bi-PAI2 can inhibit ascites growth, whereas, 213Bi-Herceptin can inhibit breast cancer growth in a nude mice model.  Conclusion: 213Bi labelled targeting vectors can specifically target ovarian cancer cells in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. These ACs may be useful agents for the treatment of ovarian cancer at the minimum residual disease stage.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Monoclonal antibodies -- Therapeutic use.</field><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Cancer -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Ovaries -- Tumors -- Treatment.</field><field name="subject">Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis.</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance in cancer cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40874</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Y1 receptor mediated control of bone</field><field name="creator">Lee, Nicola Jane, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been shown to play a critical role in the regulation of bone metabolism by signalling via Y1 and Y2 receptors.  Centrally, hypothalamic Y2 but not Y1 receptors are important for the action of NPY on bone formation and osteoblast activity.  This project investigates how the NPY system, in particular, the Y1 receptor, influences bone metabolism peripherally by examining a range of conditional and germline knockout mice using in vitro and in vivo techniques.  Revealing the possibility of a direct role for the Y1 receptor on bone cells, we demonstrate the presence of Y1 but not Y2 receptor mRNA in osteoblasts by in situ hybridisation on femur sections and RT-PCR on bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs).  In addition, we show that NPY mRNA is also expressed by osteoblasts suggesting that locally produced NPY may directly influence bone cell activity.  In order to investigate the role of osteoblastic Y1 receptors, mice with selective osteoblastic deletion of the Y1 receptor under control of the osteoblast-specific &#945;1(I)-collagen promotor were generated.  In male mice, osteoblast-specific Y1 receptor deletion resulted in a marked increase in femoral trabecular bone volume, trabecular number, cortical bone volume and cortical thickness due to elevated osteoblast activity as shown by increased mineral apposition rate and bone formation rate.  Further in vitro investigations using cells isolated from germline and conditional knockout mice demonstrated that NPY inhibits the proliferation of BMSCs via the Y1 receptor and that mineralisation is enhanced in vitro in the absence of NPY or osteoblastic Y1 receptors.  Moreover, this study reveals a critical role for the NPY system via Y1 receptors in the proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and osteoprogenitor cells.  Together these data demonstrate a direct role for the NPY system via Y1 receptors on the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblastic progenitor cells as well as on regulating the activity of mature osteoblasts, thereby altering bone formation both in vitro and in vivo. Understanding the action of NPY on osteoblasts to regulate bone metabolism could have powerful therapeutic implications for stimulating bone accrual in diseases such as osteoporosis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Y1 receptor</field><field name="subject">Neuropeptide Y</field><field name="subject">Bone</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43679</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space-time coded transmission schemes on wireless channels</field><field name="creator">Chu, Li, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Highly reliable and fast wireless communication services demand the communication channel capacity to be fully exploited. Vast amount of research effort have been expanded in the development of advance technologies, such as signal processing, channel coding, modulation/demodulation, diversity techniques, and so on.  This thesis focuses on the development of space-time coded transmission schemes. In order to provide high diversity gain with minimum design complexity, we propose a closed-loop beamforming transmission technology combined with existing simple channel coding method. We show that this coded beamforming scheme can achieve full diversity as the space-time coding technique does for a multiple-antenna system, while significantly reducing the design complexity.  It is normally impractical to install multiple antennas on a small wireless communication device. We therefore further our research to cooperative communication, in which single-antenna communicators share their antennas with partners in information relay, so that the benefit of multiple-antenna transmission can be achieved for the singleantenna users. We analyze the system performance for the typical decode-and-forward user cooperative system, formulate the code design criteria, and construct optimal codes. To simplify the system design, we introduce estimate-and-forward protocol with differential modulation scheme. In order to ensure the practicality of the system design, we introduce an equivalent link model to replace the source-relay-destination link, taking into account the imperfect detections at the relay.

This paper considers the case for SRI by examining the relationship between a range of Environmental Social Governance (ESG) rating factors and financial performance of US listed companies.  Previous research in this area has largely been at the portfolio level and focussed on return as a performance measure.  This study makes an important contribution to the literature by utilising stock level data to consider the relationship between ESG ratings and not only stock return but also wider measures of financial performance, namely valuation and operating performance.  Using a multifactor framework, this study provides evidence of a significant positive relationship between a range of ESG rating criteria and market to book value and return on assets measures, whilst a positive although inconsistent relationship between ratings and stock return is apparent.  I argue that the relationship with valuation and operating performance is more clearly identified due to these measures being based on annual data, hence being consistent with rating data and also more stable than stock return (which is impacted by shorter term factors).  In comparison to Brammer et al. (2006), the analysis shows that higher stakeholder ratings on the whole are more positively related to stock return.  The results are broadly consistent with findings of Galema et al. (2008), although additionally highlight the significance of higher ratings for both valuation and operating performance and that employee conditions are more relevant than other stakeholder rating criteria.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Investment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43729</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeling compliant or contrary? Affective influences on behavioural priming</field><field name="creator">Ashton-James, Claire Elizabeth, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Until recently, research into the social consequences of affect has focused almost exclusively on conscious judgments and behaviours. The present research investigates the impact of positive and negative affective states on automatic behavioural priming, a nonconscious social process that enables us to efficiently and effortlessly assimilate or contrast our behaviour with contextual cues. Based on previous research into factors moderating the outcome of behavioural priming, it is hypothesized that positive affect will increase the magnitude of assimilation effects, while negative affect will induce contrast effects. The results of seven experiments conducted both in the laboratory and in the field provide support for this hypothesis, and suggest that the impact of affect on behavioural priming is mediated by the way in which primed mental content is used to guide behaviour. The theoretical and clinical implications of this research as well as future research directions are discussed.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social interaction.</field><field name="subject">Affect (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Stimulus generalization.</field><field name="subject">Social perception.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis and optimisation of passive flapping wing propulsion for micro aerial vehicles</field><field name="creator">Watman, Daniel John, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Flapping wing propulsion has the potential to revolutionise the field of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), but little is known about the effect of flapping motion on the performance of flapping wings. Prototype MAVs have achieved flight with passive flapping wings moving in a sinusoidal flapping motion, but the possible benefits of alternative flapping motions have not been studied in detail. This thesis presents the development of an Integrated Testing System (ITS), which allows the evaluation of flapping wing performance for different flapping motions. A detailed parametric study of the effect of flapping motion on wing performance is performed, and the optimal flapping motion for several passive flapping wings is determined by hardware-in-the-loop optimisation of two wing performance metrics. The developed ITS was able to automatically test a variety of passive flapping wings, and demonstrated precise control of the flapping motion and accurate and repeatable measurements of average lift force, mechanical power, and wing twist angle. The parametric study revealed that of the three flapping motions tested, the sinusoidal flapping motion generated the highest lift force, but a smoothed triangular motion was able to generate lift significantly more efficiently under load. The optimal flapping motion was successfully determined for three flapping wings, and was found to increase the loaded effciency of the wings by an average of 31% over a sinusoidal flapping motion. The determined optimal motion was almost identical for the three tested wings, and was found to strongly resemble the flapping motion of insects These findings demonstrate that significant improvements in the performance of passive flapping wings can be achieved by relatively minor variations of the flapping motion. This increased understanding will ideally lead to more efficient flapping wing MAVs with higher payloads, longer flight times, and improved performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">optimisation</field><field name="subject">MAV</field><field name="subject">flapping wing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43715</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empirically derived strategy types for SMEs in developing countries - a study of knowledge in action</field><field name="creator">Sujarittanonta, Lavanchawee, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study provides a better understanding of the interactions between firm resources, strategy choice, marketing environment, and performance in rural SMEs. To date, a strategy framework specifically for SMEs in developing countries had not been developed. Past studies adapted the Miles and Snow (1987) strategy typologies or have developed strategy types for SMEs in developing countries only conceptually. This study extended the modelling approach adopted by DeSarbo et al., (2005, 2006) by empirically deriving a strategy typology specifically for SMEs in a developing country. Based on K-means clustering of theoretically relevant strategy dimensions, two strategy clusters were identified??lower performing conservative strategy A, and higher performing customer oriented strategy B. The issue of resource limitations in strategy formulation had not been adequately addressed by past studies on SME strategy. By examining how and to what extent objective and perceived dimensions of the external environment impact the resources-strategy-performance (RSP) links in rural SMEs, the study tested the applicability of the Resource-Based View (RBV) and the Knowledge-Based View (KBV) in a new context??that of rural SMEs in a developing country. Both RBV and KBV were supported by the findings. Key strategic resources in rural SMEs were explored for its strategic and performance implications. General resources and capabilities, knowledge-based resources, and in particular ??tacit?? marketing knowledge, were examined in an aggregated sense through the intuitive understanding within the one SME owner-manager. Strategy choice moderated and mediated the resource-performance relationship. SMEs with higher levels of resources and capabilities tended to adopt the higher performing strategy B. The study provided further insights on the kinds of knowledge that mattered. Knowledge-based resources that were more tacit in character determined strategy choice and performance??higher customer serving skills led to adopting the higher performing strategy B, while planning skills led to adopting the lower performing strategy A. Both the objective and perceived environments influenced SME performance by moderating the resource-strategy-performance relationship. SMEs located in more munificent provinces perceived their market environment accurately, possessed higher knowledge-based resources, and were more likely to adopt the higher performing strategy B.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge-based strategies</field><field name="subject">Marketing strategy</field><field name="subject">Small medium firms (SMEs)</field><field name="subject">resource-based view (RBV)</field><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="subject">resource-strategy-performance</field><field name="subject">environmental munificence</field><field name="subject">tacit marketing knowledge</field><field name="subject">rural SMEs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43603</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Frames in the flight deck: a sociological approach to situation awareness</field><field name="creator">Henderson, Simon Thornton, Aviation, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Situation Awareness (SA) is the aviation term for the construct describing how actors extract meaning and make sense of their dynamically changing environment. Within the aviation domain, it is broadly acknowledged that SA plays a crucial role for pilots in coping with hazardous situations and its loss is cited as a significant factor in aircraft accidents and incidents. A broad range of psychologically based theories has been applied to conceptualise SA. The aim of this research thesis is to develop an alternative, sociologically based approach, largely drawn from Erving Goffman??s (1974) Frame Analysis, and assess whether it can be used to effectively describe, analyse and discuss SA. An open observation method was used to collect data in the flight deck during ten commercial international flight sectors conducted in an advanced wide-body aircraft. A running narrative of flight activity and associated context was recorded from a purposeful sample of flights operated by consenting flight crews. Data was managed in the NVIVO?? qualitative software analysis program. Strips of activity associated with the establishment or maintenance of SA were identified and examined in accordance with key concepts derived from frame analysis. The results show that key concepts drawn from Goffman??s (1974) frame analysis are able to be applied to the coding and discussion of data. Several emergent themes describe distinct SA behaviours relating to frame establishment and maintenance. These behaviours include; frame confirming, questioning, seeking, setting, proposing, clearing, accepting, reviewing and anticipating. Some unique modifications are made to Goffman??s underlying concepts in order to address specific contextual issues emergent in flight deck operations. SA is supported as a meaningful construct in the aviation domain. This thesis establishes that Goffman??s (1974) general theory of frame analysis supports the major underlying concepts of the specific SA construct. Additionally, a method derived from frame analysis is used to examine and analyse the observed intersubjective SA processes. This analysis also develops several unique perspectives concerning flight crew task performance that have wide ranging implications in procedural design, training and airspace integration. Lastly, practitioner based notions of SA are shown to be equivalent to that of ??frame.??</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aviation</field><field name="subject">SA</field><field name="subject">Situation Awareness</field><field name="subject">Flight deck</field><field name="subject">Sociology</field><field name="subject">Goffman</field><field name="subject">Frame</field><field name="subject">Frame analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40907</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infection control barriers in rural Indonesia: a study of four clinical practice areas</field><field name="creator">Marjadi, Brahmaputra, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background and Aim: The applicability of internationally-accepted infection control guidelines in rural Indonesia is questionable due to differences in resources availability and local contexts. Infection control barriers specific to rural Indonesia therefore need to be identified to assist in developing targeted infection control programs that are resource- and context-appropriate at the institutional, regional and national levels.  Methods: This mixed methods study of ten healthcare facilities (hospitals and clinics, public and private) in a rural Indonesian district, all with severely limited resources, explored clinical practices in four areas: intravenous therapy, antibiotic usage, instrument reprocessing and hand hygiene. The quantitative methods used included univariate, multivariate and survival analyses of primary and secondary clinical data. The qualitative methods included a grounded theory analysis of observations, short and in-depth interviews and focus group discussion data. These two components of the study were synthesised to ascertain the magnitude and underlying factors of healthcare-associated infection risks and barriers to infection control programs.  Findings: Inappropriate clinical practices caused excessive and unrecognised risks of primary bloodstream infection, surgical site infection, blood borne virus infection, and the development and spread of multi-resistant bacteria. The four diverse clinical practice areas exhibited common and interwoven underlying factors, which were: healthcare workers?? inadequate clinical knowledge, a lack of managerial support, and cultural beliefs shared by the healthcare workers and community members that prevailed over evidence-based knowledge. Non-clinical factors from inside and outside the healthcare facilities were inter-related and cannot be separated from the ensuing clinical practice inadequacies. An analytical framework that categorises infection control barriers into clinical and non-clinical domains as well as internal and external factors is therefore proposed to ensure a comprehensive infection control program design.  Conclusion: The current clinically-focused infection control programs are likely to have limited and temporary results in rural Indonesia due to barriers being in the main non-clinical in origin. An effective and sustainable infection control program needs to concurrently address basic clinical practice improvements and the underlying managerial, attitudinal and cultural barriers. This public health aspect of infection control is often neglected yet crucial for the success of any infection control program in rural Indonesia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">low resource</field><field name="subject">infection control</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43670</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The involvement of the Kynurenine pathway in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</field><field name="creator">Chen, Yiquan, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive and fatal motor neuron disease of unclear aetiology, although the general consensus is of a multifactorial disease. The kynurenine pathway (KP), activated during neuroinflammation, is emerging as a possible contributory factor in ALS. The KP is the major route for tryptophan (TRP) catabolism. The intermediates generated can be either neurotoxic, such as quinolinic acid (QUIN), or neuroprotective, such as picolinic acid (PIC), an important endogenous metal chelator. The first and inducible enzyme is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). As the extent of the involvement of the KP in ALS is unknown, the main aim of this thesis was to attempt to answer that question. The techniques used in this work include HPLC, GC/MS, RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and immunocyctochemsitry. The main findings of this project are: (1) the complete KP is present in the mouse motor neuron cell line, NSC-34; (2) QUIN toxicity on NSC-34 cells may be ameliorated through the administration of NMDA antagonists, neuroprotective kynurenines, kynurenine inhibitor and QUIN monoclonal antibody; (3) in ALS patients, QUIN CSF and serum levels are significantly elevated, while PIC serum levels are significantly reduced; (4) ALS brain and spinal cord tissue show extensive microglia activation and positive immunoreactivity IDO and QUIN in spinal motor neurons and Betz cells in the motor cortex; and (5) kynurenine pathway inhibitor and analogue, R061-8048 and tranilast, are able to prolong the survival in the G93A SOD1 ALS transgenic mouse model. In conclusion, this study provide the first strong evidence for the involvement of the KP in ALS, and these data point to an inflammation-driven excitotoxic-chelation defective mechanism in ALS, which is amenable to KP analogue and inhibitor in ALS transgenic mice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</field><field name="subject">Kynurenine pathway.</field><field name="subject">Quinolinic acid.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Body and soul</field><field name="creator">Clarke, Warwick, Media Arts, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research component, "Body and Soul", is an interdisciplinary, comparative study of the essay form, focusing on the Weimar period. The essay is a marginal literary genre, which, like much documentary style photography, attempts "the imaginative recreation of a culture, a period or an individual". August Sander's photographic opus, People of the 20th Century and Robert Musil's essayistic novel, The Man Without Qualities invite comparison as complex and problematic portraits of their respective societies.  Sander's typological portraits are well known and his legacy informs much of contemporary documentary photography. Sixty images were published in 1929 by Kurt Wolff, Transmare Verlag, Munich, as Antlitz der Zeit (Face of Our Time) with an introduction by Alfred D??blin. The rust two volumes of Robert Musil's, Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften (The Man Without Qualities), were published in 1930 and 1932 by Rowohlt Verlag, Hamburg.  Recent publication of new editions of both Musil's and Sander's works prompted the attempt to reconcile two portraits of people and events of the early decades of the 20th Century in Germany and Austria. 	The essay form in literature and the documentary style in photography are examined with regard to the polemic associated with truth and reality. This review attempts to illustrate the inevitable inclusion of the fictional element into the fabric of both forms of investigation. The study concludes with a review of contemporary art practice in photo-documentary and some thoughts on future developments.  The studio component, "Dargan", is a photographic essay of a site in the Blue Mountains West of Sydney. Focusing on relics of industrial activity in the region, and their effects on the landscape, large format colour photographs were produced to establish a documentary style body of work for exhibition as large-scale colour analogue prints. The work is the response to a need to engage with the Australian landscape and to establish a sustainable practice that recognises and takes into account an ambivalent relationship with "country".</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Body art.</field><field name="subject">Mind and body.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44096</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The epidemiology of cancer in people with iatrogenic and acquired immunodeficiency</field><field name="creator">van Leeuwen, Marina Theodora, National Centre in HIV Epidemiology &amp; Clinical Research, UNSW</field><field name="description">A series of epidemiological studies are presented of cancer risk after kidney transplantation and in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, based on data linkage between Australian, nationwide, population-based cohorts of kidney transplant recipients, people with HIV, and cancer. Risk factors were studied for the two most commonly registered cancers after kidney transplantation, lip cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The importance of established risk factors for lip cancer was confirmed, including exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) and tobacco smoking. New evidence was observed of an association with immunosuppressive agents which potentiate UVR-related cellular damage, which may have broader implications for non-melanoma skin cancer risk in this setting. Clinic-based data suggest that NHL arising early and late after transplantation may be aetiologically distinct. Results observed herein support the possibility of two mechanisms of lymphomagenesis: one predominantly of primary Epstein Barr virus infection during intense immunosuppression and another, of dysregulated lymphoid proliferation in the context of prolonged immunosuppression. Importantly, risk of NHL was observed to persist even ten years after transplantation. For both lip cancer and NHL, risk was significantly reduced on transplant failure and reinstitution of dialysis when immunosuppression is usually ceased. The effect on cancer risk of reduction of immunosuppression was investigated for infection-related and other cancers. Risk was significantly reduced for some other infection- and immunodeficiency-related cancers including Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and melanoma, and non-significantly for anogenital cancers. No effect on risk was observed for cancers of the stomach, leukaemia, or the common epithelial cancers. Risk was significantly higher on reinstitution of dialysis for thyroid cancer. Cancer incidence was examined in HIV infection since the introduction of effective antiretroviral therapy and the reduction in the extent of HIV-related immunosuppression. The patterns observed were entirely consistent with those seen in kidney transplant recipients. Rates of KS, NHL and melanoma declined significantly, whereas rates of anal cancer remained stable. Rates of lung cancer and leukaemia were unchanged. Rates of prostate and colorectal cancers were consistently lower than general population rates. These observations highlight the differential role of current immune function and argue against a generalised effect of immunosurveillance in cancer prevention.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cohort</field><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Immunodeficiency</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43710</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reduction and softening/melting behaviour of olivine pellet in the experimental blast furnace</field><field name="creator">Lee, Si Hyung, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An in-depth study has been carried out on the reduction, softening and melting behavior of olivine based pellets in the experimental blast furnace. The aim of the project was to develop a fundamental understanding of the reduction mechanisms of olivine based pellets and to develop a correlation between the reduction rate and the softening behavior in the cohesive zone of blast furnace. The carburization characteristics of reduced iron were also investigated by examining olivine pellet and coke samples excavated and probed from an experimental blast furnace as well as the experimental investigations of pure hematite and heat treated coke. X-ray diffraction analysis was used to successfully determine the reduction degree of olivine pellets in different parts of the experimental blast furnace. These results were found to be consistent with assessments of reduction degree based on a detailed chemical analysis. The average reduction degree of iron oxide was seen to increase as the pellets descended towards lower zones of the EBF. Up to 75% reduction was completed before the pellet had reached the cohesive zone; remaining reduction was completed within the cohesive zone. Coke Lc showed a linear variation with experimental temperature above 11000C; a correlation was established to estimate furnace temperature as a function of EBF depth. The reduction degree of iron ore pellet showed a linear correlation with distance from the stock line of the EBF to the upper part of cohesive zone. But an abrupt increase in reduction rate was observed in the cohesive zone, a result observed in both EBF and experimental studies. The presence of olivine did not have much influence on the reduction degree of iron ore pellets for temperatures below 1100oC in the upper shaft zone of the EBF. However, olivine was found to increase the rate of reduction in the advanced stages of reduction in the cohesive zone for temperatures in excess of 1100oC. This effect was attributed to the formation of increased amount of molten iron oxide within the pellet. The initial melt formation and acceleration of the reduction rate in the cohesive zone of the EBF were also investigated. From the comparison between the reduction degree of excavated olivine pellets in this study and previous studies of EBF, it was found that the excavated pellets were located in the cohesive zone and increase of reduction rate in this zone could be verified by not only the change of gas composition, but also initial melt formation containing FeO phase. The chemical composition of slag phases of excavated pellet samples were located on the line between 2FeO??SiO2 and 2MgO??SiO2 in the FeO-MgO-SiO2 ternary phase diagram. This result is in good agreement with the assumption that the initial slag formation of the olivine pellets had proceeded from the fayalite and after reduction the FeO contents in the slag phase had decreased and eventually precipitated as slag with a higher melting point. From the analysis of carbon contents of the excavated pellets in cohesive zone, it was observed that the carburization of iron pellets began after the complete reduction. This study has established that the reduction rate of iron pellet is the rate controlling step for carburization irrespective of the carburization reaction by the solid carbon.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pellet</field><field name="subject">Reduction</field><field name="subject">Softening</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40939</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Explanations for antisocial behaviour in adolescents : the role of pubertal development on cognitive processes</field><field name="creator">Czech, Suzanne, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Research suggests that the temporary rise in adolescent antisocial behaviour (ASS) is attributable to a very large number of young people each engaging in a relatively small number of ASS's while progressing through adolescence. One possible explanation for the temporary increase in ASS during adolescence is that during puberty, the cognitive processes responsible for monitoring and controlling behaviour are disrupted. In support of this, recent research has found that adolescents' participation in ASS is positively correlated with the stage of pubertal development rather than age. Additionally, there is evidence that a temporary 'dip' in executive functioning (planning, organizing, decision-making) occurs at an age range (Le. 11-14 years) typically associated with the onset of puberty. This thesis reports a first test of a model which proposes a causal relationship between puberty, decreased executive function and increased antisocial behaviour. Self-report data on pubertal development, antisocial attitudes and ASS participation were collected from 323 boys and girls (ages 9 -17 years) attending New South Wales public schools. Executive function, (Le. updating, response inhibition, set-shifting) was measured in a 3D-minute individual interview. Data were analysed to determine if participants reported greater participation in ASS during puberty onset and whether this period was also characterized by a decline in executive function. In addition, it was investigated whether adolescents who attain puberty earlier than their peers participate in ASS earlier, longer, and at higher rates than their 'on-time' or 'late-maturing' peers, and whether there was an association between 'early' puberty and a persistent reduction in executive function.  Results revealed that ASS participation was significantly associated with puberty onset timing, and some significant associations were found between antisocial attitudes and pubertal timing. There was some indication of decreased executive function at puberty onset and a link between early pubertal timing and a persistent reduction in executive function. Thus, there is some partial evidence to support the proposed model of adolescent ASS. However, complications in performing mediation analysis prevent concluding that executive function mediates the relationship between pubertal development and ASB. The implications of these findings are discussed with reference to future research in this field.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Behavior disorders in adolescence</field><field name="subject">Puberty</field><field name="subject">Cognition in adolescence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40941</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling outcomes from orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Yoon, Jeong Ho, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research aimed to develop and validate a new method for calculating anterior and posterior corneal topography. The novel calculation method was then used to evaluate the influence of orthokeratology (OK) lens wear and overnight edema on posterior corneal shape, and to develop a physical model for anterior and posterior corneal shape changes during myopic overnight OK. The new method uses anterior corneal topographic data derived from the Medmont E300 corneal topographer, and total corneal thickness data measured along the horizontal corneal meridian using the Holden-Payor optical pachometer. The data are then entered into an Interactive Data Language computer program, which calculates the anterior and posterior corneal apical radii of curvature and Q (asphericity) based on the calculated anterior ellipsoid curve, the locations of corneal pachometry measurements, direction of thickness measurements, and the local radius of curvature. Pachometry data were optimised based on the local radius of anterior corneal curvature and an exact solution for the relationship between real and apparent thickness. The newly developed method was validated using a range of test surfaces and repeatability was also investigated with five adult subjects. Eighteen young adult subjects wore BE OK lenses overnight only in both eyes for 14 days. Ten young adult subjects participated as a control group, wearing J-Contour RGP lenses in one eye only for one night. OK subjects were assessed on days 1, 4, 7, and 14, and control group subjects on day 1, in the morning and evening. Subjective refraction, visual acuity, corneal topography and corneal thickness were measured. Most change in refractive error occurred within the first 7 nights of overnight OK. This rapid reduction in myopia was associated with improvement in unaided VA, and flattening of anterior corneal curvature. There were no changes in posterior corneal apical radius but an increase towards an oblate posterior corneal Q was found during 14 days of overnight OK, at both morning and evening measurements. Fixed anterior corneal points were determined at 8.13mm and 5.30mm chords at morning and evening measurements in the OK group. The points of maximum increase in anterior corneal elevation at evening and morning measurements were at 6.90mm and 7.00mm chords respectively. In the OK group, significant backwards movement of anterior and posterior corneal apices was found relative to the fixed anterior corneal points at the morning measurement. Backwards movement of the anterior corneal apex remained during the day whereas the posterior corneal apex recovered to baseline. In conclusion, our results support the theory that the OK refractive effect is achieved through remodelling of anterior corneal layers, without overall corneal bending. Central corneal thinning in the evening after overnight OK lens wear is primarily due to to posterior movement in space of the anterior corneal apex. The posterior direction of overnight corneal edema across the cornea in OK lens wear is consistent with previous models that predict that the cornea swells in a posterior direction during edema.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40944</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The hospital experience of elderly patients with limited English proficiency.</field><field name="creator">Garrett, Pamela, Clinical School - South Western Sydney, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose Over half a million Australians (561,413) speak limited English, with 29 per cent of those being aged over 65 years (ABS 2006). Little research has been conducted into the acute hospital experience of elderly patients with limited English proficiency.  This thesis examines, in an acute hospital setting, the subjective experience of a consecutive convenience sample of 258 elderly acute or emergency patients from nine language groups, who prefer to speak a language other than English.  Method Trained bilingual staff investigated communication methods used by hospital staff with participants in a multilingual telephone survey (MTS). Information for validation was obtained from a medical records audit (MRA). Hospital statistical information was linked with MTS and MRA data. The agreement between the MTS and the MRA was analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. A score, the 'Communication Complexity Score' (CCS), was developed to reflect patient clinical complexity, and the association between this score and interpreter usage was assessed. Seven language-specific focus groups were conducted to identify factors associated with a positive, a negative, or a very negative experience. Constructivist grounded theory was used to analyse the discourse in the focus groups.  Results Thirty-one per cent of patients reported using professional interpreters. Concordance was present between the MTS and MRA. A positive association was found between clinical complexity and interpreter usage. The CCS had good psychometric properties. Many patients reported positive experiences; however, a theme of powerlessness was identified. Language barriers, poor patient and family involvement, staff shortages or incompetence, and inattention to cultural mores were all factors associated with negative experiences. Some patients discounted their negative experiences and were reluctant to assert their healthcare rights. An explanatory construct for this phenomenon, the 'Happy Migrant Effect,' was developed. Contributing factors for this effect include:  powerlessness; positive assessment of Australian healthcare compared with the patient's country of origin; patriotism; cultural norms proscribing acceptance; politeness; desire for social acceptability; self-denigration for not learning English; and fear of reprisals following complaint.

It is essential for the complement cascade to be under tight regulation in order to prevent excessive production of complement proteins. C5a is the most potent anaphylotoxin produced by the complement system, it binds C5a receptor (C5aR, CD88) and C5L2 (GPR77). C5a binding to C5aR induces leukocyte chemotaxis and release of inflammatory mediators. Over-production of C5a is known to be involved in many inflammatory and pathological conditions such as RA, I1R injury and sepsis, making it an attractive therapeutic target. Human and mouse C5aR share low homology and blocking C5a/C5aR signaling with small molecules has been challenging. We generated human C5aR knockout/knockin (hC5aR KI) mice in which the mouse C5aR coding region was replaced with that of human C5aR to utilize them for the development of human therapeutics targeting C5aR. hC5aR KI mice showed normal development, and leukocytes from hC5aR KI mice responded well to mouse C5a. We used two approaches to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against hC5aR. We used a mouse cell line transfected with hC5aR or neutrophils from hC5aR KI mice to immunize wild-type mice and generated high-affinity antagonistic mAbs which are specific to human C5aR. Anti-hC5aR mAb 7F3 blocked C5a-induced signaling completely without agonistic activity in vitro. In the animal model of K/BxN inflammatory arthritis, 7F3 both prevented and reversed inflammation. Currently, the function of the second C5a receptor, C5L2, remains controversial. There are contradicting reports from C5L2 KO mice that were generated by independent groups. We assessed the function of human C5L2 using an antagonistic mAb that specifically blocks C5L2 function and not C5aR. In vitro analysis using the C5L2-blocking mAb showed that C5a does not signal via C5L2 to affect chemotaxis or phagocytosis by neutrophils, indicating that C5L2 is not a signaling receptor for C5a, at least in these cellular functions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Complement (Immunology)</field><field name="subject">Complement activation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/40995</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of high resolution satellite data (IKONOS) in the establishment and maintenance of an urban geographical information system</field><field name="creator">Richards, Eric Wesley, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The past years has seen the advent of the availability of high resolution commercial satellite imagery. This study shows that whilst high resolution commercial satellite imagery is capable of producing reasonable spatial data both in quality and cost for use in an urban GIS the challenges of supplying this data commercially is not limited to simply the provision of the imagery.  Since a significant amount of work has been done by others to examine and quantify the technical suitability and limitations of high resolution commercial satellite imagery, this study examines the practical limitations and opportunities presented with the arrival of this new spatial data source. In order to do this a number of areas are examined; the historical development of the satellite systems themselves, the business evolution of the owning commercial ventures, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) data and service requirements for a diverse range of spatial data applications and finally the evaluation and comparison of the imagery as a spatial data source.  The study shows that high resolution commercial satellite imagery is capable of providing spatial data and imagery for a variety of uses at different levels of accuracy as well as opening up a new era in the supply and application of metric imagery. From a technical approach high resolution commercial satellite imagery provides remote access, one metre or better resolution, 11 bit imagery and a multispectral capability not previously available from space. Equally as challenging is the process or achievement in making the technical capability a reality in a commercial world requiring a financial return at all levels; from the image vendors to the spatial science professional providing a service to a paying customer. The imagery must be financially viable for all concerned.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">commerical</field><field name="subject">imagery</field><field name="subject">satellite</field><field name="subject">high</field><field name="subject">resolution</field><field name="subject">ikonos</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">spatial</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43730</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Target interest rate news effects on the Asia pacific financial markets</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Do Quoc Tho, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is the first study that provides comprehensive empirical evidence on both the impacts of the target interest rate news from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on the Australian financial markets, and the spillover effects of the target interest rate news from the US Federal Reserves (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) on the Asia Pacific's equity and currency markets. This thesis contributes to the current literature in several ways. First, while there is ample evidence in the literature suggesting that the markets would not react to what is already expected but will react to the news, the current literature on the RBA's target rate effects is still limited to the investigation of the overall announcement impact on the first moment of the Australian market return only. Therefore, this thesis firstly comprehensively investigates the impacts of the unexpected components of the RBA's target rate announcements (or news) on the first two moments of various segments of the Australian financial markets including interest rate changes, the Australian dollar and stock market returns. In so doing, this thesis contributes to the current literature on the impacts of domestic target interest rate news.  Second, while the established literature seems to be missing a thorough investigation of the spillover effects of the Fed's and the ECB's news on the Asia Pacific markets, this thesis provides comprehensive evidence on the spillover effects of the Fed's and the ECB's target rate news on both the mean and volatility of the Asia Pacific's stock and currency returns. Furthermore, we not only document the presence of the news spillover effects but also highlight the incremental explanatory power of the target interest rate news in the presence of the indirect effects from the US's and euro area's markets to the Asia-Pacific markets. To this end, this thesis contributes to the literature on spillover effects of foreign target interest rate news.  Third, while the literature is silent on how quickly the target interest rate news is absorbed in foreign markets, this thesis takes a step forward and breaks down the daily horizon into the overnight and the intraday horizons. In so doing, the thesis examines the absorption speed of target rate news in the Asia-Pacific markets. This is an important issue because there might be potential for a diverse array of response dynamics across countries due to heterogeneous market developments, nature of monetary policy synchronization, and financial and real integration with the U.S. and the euro area.  Specifically, this thesis presents three independent empirical inquiries that contribute to the literature on domestic and spillover effects of the target interest rate news. Chapter 4 provides comprehensive empirical evidence for the impacts of the RBA's target rate news on various segments of the Australian financial markets during the period from 1998 to 2006. We also investigate the spillover effects of the US Fed's news on the Australian financial markets. We show that the RBA's and the Fed's news significantly affect the Australian financial markets in line with a priori expectations. However, while the RBA's news raises volatility in the Australian financial markets, the volatility was significantly lower in all market segments following the Fed's news. The spillover effects of the US Fed's and the ECB's target interest rate news on the mean and the volatility of twelve Asia Pacific's stock markets' returns are examined in Chapter 5, and seven Asia Pacific exchange rates against the US dollar and the euro over the period 1999-2006 are carried out in Chapter 6. The spillover effects on the conditional mean are generally consistent with the literature where a majority of Asia Pacific stock markets shows significant negative returns and a majority of currencies depreciates against the US dollar and the euro in response to the Fed's and the ECB's unexpected rate rises. Furthermore, in response to the two target rate news, the conditional volatility of the Asia Pacific stock markets was higher while the market calming effects have been observed for the currency markets and both the Fed and the ECB news elicit persisting volatility responses. We conjecture that as the ECB's news tends to confirm the Fed's earlier decision, this relationship might help reduce uncertainties in the Asia Pacific currency markets upon the future path of target interest rates from both the Central Banks, which ultimately results in into a lower volatility level. These findings are important not only to the Asia Pacific&#146;s policy makers to help them improve the conduct of monetary policy but also to market participants in designing trading mechanisms as well as risk management strategies in response to both domestic and external interest rate shocks. Furthermore, these findings also shed light on the lead-lag relationship between the Fed and the ECB in making policy decisions. The notion that the ECB follows the Fed in setting its policy is so strong amongst market participants that empirical evidence seems to be crucial. Despite the fact that the ECB's news arrives after the Fed's news, this study provides evidence that the ECB's news has its own merits in the Asia Pacific markets and helps resolve differences in beliefs among market participants.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Target interest rate news</field><field name="subject">Spillover effects</field><field name="subject">EGARCH</field><field name="subject">Volatility</field><field name="subject">Asia Pacific</field><field name="subject">RBA</field><field name="subject">ECB</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43788</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Understanding price movements : measurement of price rigidity and pure price change</field><field name="creator">Syed, Iqbal, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary focus of this thesis is on price movements at market levels. This thesis examines the measurement of two aspects of price movements: the degree of price rigidity and pure price change. Price is defined to be rigid if its response to a demand or cost shock is slow and the magnitude of adjustment is proportionately less than the shock. Price rigidity is one of the critical issues in the microfoundations of macroeconomics, and its importance has been documented at least since Keynes' (1936) The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Regarding pure price change, in many markets the measurement of pure price change is difficult to obtain because the observed prices are contaminated by quality and compositional changes in the products. The literature on price indexes emphasises the importance of accounting for quality change at the market level. These issues will be explored in this thesis. The chapters of this thesis provide distinct but complementary contributions to the literature of price movement. Chapter 2 uses vector error correction models to estimate the degree of price rigidity in the retail coffee markets of 17 different countries. A stylised fact that emerges from the work is that price adjustment typically occurs within two quarters after a shock is imposed. In terms of the magnitude of price changes, prices are found to be more rigid to cost shocks than to foreign shocks. Chapter 3 explores the extent to which products follow systematic pricing patterns over their life cycle and the impact this has on the measurement of inflation. A number of specifications of hedonic models have been applied to data on supermarket and electronic products. Strong evidence of systematic life cycle effects has been found. Chapter 4 develops an hedonic regression model to construct multilateral indexes-indexes that are consistent across time and space-in housing markets. The set-up of the hedonic model attains some desirable properties, both in terms of statistical and index number perspectives. Applied to house prices in Sydney, the model generated some interesting results, including that the cheaper regions exhibit greater price dynamics than the more expensive regions. Some potential areas for further research are also considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41019</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling of ocean tides</field><field name="creator">Das, Pritha, School of Methematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis three independent studies of tidal dynamics have been pesented. The  first is an analytical study of continental shelf tides forced at the ocean boundary. Earlier studies have shown that the response for a sloping shelf and a flat shelf differ and that the response for a flat shelf changes when tides are incident at an angle. Other studies considered a sloping shelf but they did not take into account a possible non-zero depth at a coastal wall. This study shows that the effects of a sloping shelf, a coastal wall and obliquely incident tides an all significantly modify the response on the shelf. The modification increases with the width of the shelf, and in a wide shelf scenario, near resonance, it greatly modifies the response. Secondly, the Princeton Ocean Model in barotropic mode along with a tracer transport module has been used to study the tides of Sydney Harbour. The tidally induced residual circulation due to the semi-diurnal tide consists of a series of recirculating gyres which are due to the interaction of flow with topography. This study shows that in the harbour it is the Lagrangian residual velocity not the Eulerian residual velocity which determines the net transport  of material over a tidal cycle. In addition, the flushing time of the harbour varies significantly in space, and the tidal mixing is restricted in the vicinity of the entrance. The third is a theoretical study of forced oscillations in a rotating, flat-bottomed, circular basin. This study shows that the direction of propagation of waves in a basin depends on the ratio of its radius to depth. At each latitude there is a critical value of this ratio and this value decreases with increase in latitude. Beyond this value, waves start to propagate around the basin in the opposite direction to the earth ???s rotation (clockwise in the northern hemisphere and anti-clockwise in the southern hemisphere).The presence of friction increases this critical value which shows that friction plays an important role in determining the response.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tides</field><field name="subject">mathemetical models</field><field name="subject">oceans</field><field name="subject">dynamics</field><field name="subject">continental shelf</field><field name="subject">Sydney Habour</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cellular mechanisms of QT prolongation and proarrhythmia induced by non-antiarrhythmic drugs</field><field name="creator">Tie, Hii  Hui, Clinical School - St. Vincents, UNSW</field><field name="description">A variety of drugs prolong cardiac repolarization (manifested as QT prolongation on ECG), although the major example are the so-called class III antiarrhythmics. However, antiarrhythmic drugs which prolong cardiac repolarization are not harmless, as they may also be proarrhythmic, inducing a potentially fatal arrhythmia known as torsade de pointes (TdP). Recently, it has become apparent that a wide variety of non-antiarrhythmic agents may also, as an entirely undesired side-effect, provoke TdP. TdP is also characteristic of the congenital long QT syndrome, one form of which is caused by mutations in the HERG gene which encodes the major repolarizing potassium channel, IKr. Furthermore, HERG appears to be the main molecular target for drugs which cause QT prolongation. This thesis investigates the cellular mechanism for QT prolongation, proarrhythmia and sudden death associated with several commonly prescribed non-antiarrhythmic drugs. Specifically, we studied the effects of an antimalarial agent, halofantrine, and five psychoactive agents, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, clozapine, amitriptyline and mianserin on the HERG channel. A better understanding of the way these drugs interact with HERG could facilitate the development of safer drugs.   We used the whole-cell voltage clamp technique to study currents produced by stable transfection of HERG into Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1). Our HERG-transfected cells possessed a potassium channel with biophysical properties similar to HERG-transfected cells previously reported (e.g. Xenopus oocytes, human embryonic kidney cells 293) and also to human IKr. HERG currents were potently inhibited by E-4031, a defining pharmacological signature of IKr. Therefore, these cells provide an appropriate model for the study of this important current in isolation. Halofantrine is a widely used antimalarial agent which has been associated with QT prolongation, TdP and sudden death. Halofantrine blocked HERG tail currents potently with an IC50 of 196.9 nM. Channel inhibition was time-, voltage- and use-dependent. Halofantrine did not alter channel activation or deactivation kinetics but inactivation was accelerated and there was a 20 mV hyperpolarizing shift in the mid-activation potential of steady state inactivation. Block increased with increasing depolarizing pulse duration and was enhanced by pulses that render channels inactivated. This is the first report of HERG channel blockade by halofantrine and is the likely cellular mechanism for its proarrhythmic potential. Our data indicate preferential binding of halofantrine to the open and inactivated channel states. Cardiovascular mortality in psychiatric patients is high. Reports of sudden unexplained death in those taking antipsychotic drugs have raised concerns that part of this excess may be due to drug-induced arrhythmias. We found that thioridazine and chlorpromazine blocked HERG channels (IC50 1.07 ????M and 1.47????M respectively) at clinically relevant concentrations and this is likely the cellular mechanism for their ability to prolong QT interval and induce TdP. To date, HERG block by chlorpromazine has not been reported and the state dependence of channel blockade by these phenothiazines has not been studied. Our results indicate that both drugs preferentially bind to closed HERG channels on the basis that block was not time-, voltage- or use-dependent, did not alter channel activation or deactivation kinetics and was unaffected by the depolarizing pulse duration. Clozapine is the prototype of the newer atypical antipsychotic drugs and is more efficacious and better tolerated than the traditional agents. Serious cardiotoxicity have occurred in clozapine-treated patients including sudden death. We found that clozapine produced a tonic block on HERG channels indicating preferential binding to the closed channel state. The IC50 for block was 2.62 ????M. This is close to the therapeutic concentration of the drug (0.6 to 2 ????M) and concentrations above 10 ????M have been reported during overdoses. Although there have been no specific reports of QT prolongation or TdP in clozapine-treated patients, our data raises the possibility of proarrhythmia as another potential explanation for sudden death during clozapine treatment.  Amitriptyline, a commonly prescribed tricyclic antidepressant, can induce a variety of cardiac rhythm disturbances. Most reports have attributed these effects to its Na+ channel blocking ability. We found that amitriptyline blocked HERG channels with an IC50 of 10 ????M. Such high concentrations can be achieved during overdoses. Thus HERG channel blockade likely underlies amitriptyline????s QT-prolonging effect. Channel inhibition by amitriptyline exhibited positive voltage- and use-dependence and increased progressively with further prolongation of depolarization during an envelope of tails protocol, indicating preferential binding  to an activated (open/inactivated) state of the channel. In contrast to the tricyclics, the tetracyclic antidepressant, mianserin, is much safer and only very rarely associated with cardiac complications. HERG channel blockade by mianserin was the least potent among the 5 psychoactive drugs we studied, with an IC50 of 14.78 ????M, which is 30- to 40-fold higher than therapeutic plasma concentrations of the drug. This probably, in part, accounts for the lack of reports of QT prolongation or TdP with mianserin. Mianserin displayed preferential affinity for an activated state of HERG channels on the basis of voltage-dependent block, a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage of half-maximal activation and an increase in block at low external potassium concentration. Our results show that HERG block is a common feature of many non-cardiac drugs and that this underlies their potential for QT prolongation and TdP. Although the proarrhythmic risk varies according to potency of HERG block (e.g. mianserin is a weak blocker and does not induce TdP), other factors such as drug metabolism, protein binding and myocardial concentrations are also important since the risk of proarrhythmia during clinical use differ significantly even among the more potent HERG blockers.  The preferential binding of these drugs to different channel states together with their diverse chemical structures suggest the presence of multiple distinct binding sites for drugs on HERG channels. There is increasing awareness that many non-antiarrhythmic drugs can prolong the QT interval and provoke TdP. Cardiac safety is now a major issue in new drug development. Our model of HERG K+ channels stably expressed in a mammalian cell line (CHO-K1) provides a useful tool for screening, at the preclinical stage, the proarrhythmic potential of novel drugs intended for human use.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Arrhythmia</field><field name="subject">Electrocardiography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Indigenous rights under the Australian constitution : a reconciliation perspective</field><field name="creator">Malbon, Justin, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the possibilities for building a reconciliatory jurisprudence for the protection of indigenous rights under the Australian Constitution.  The thesis first examines what could be meant by the term ???reconciliation??? in a legal context and argues that it requires (1) acknowledgement of and atonement for past wrongdoing, (2) the provision of recompense, and (3) the establishment of legal and constitutional structures designed to ensure that similar wrongs are not repeated in the future.  The thesis focuses on the last of these three requirements.  It is further argued that developing a reconciliatory jurisprudence first requires the courts to free themselves from the dominant paradigm of strict positivism so that they are liberated to pay due regard to questions of morality.  	Given this framework, the thesis then sets out to examine the purpose and scope of the race power (section 51(xxvi)) of the Australian Constitution, with particular regard to the case of Kartinyeri v Commonwealth in which the High Court directly considered the power.  The thesis concludes that the majority of the Court had not, for various reasons, properly considered the nature of the power.  An appropriate ruling, it is argued, should find that the power does not enable Parliament to discriminate adversely against racial minorities.  	The thesis then proceeds to consider whether there are implied terms under the Constitution that protect fundamental rights.  It is argued that these rights are indeed protected because the Constitution is based upon the rule of law.  In addition constitutional provisions are to be interpreted subject to the presumption that its terms are not to be understood as undermining fundamental rights unless a constitutional provision expressly states otherwise.  The thesis also considers whether there is an implied right to equality under the Constitution.  The conclusion drawn is that such a right exists and that it is both procedural and substantive in nature.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians</field><field name="subject">civil rights</field><field name="subject">government relations</field><field name="subject">legal status</field><field name="subject">discrimination in justice administration</field><field name="subject">race relations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental and pathophysiological modulation of oesophageal afferent pathways: implications for oesophago-pharyngeal reflexes, regurgitation and symptom perception /</field><field name="creator">Szcz??sniak, Michal Marcin, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The work presented in this thesis concerns neurophysiology and pharmacology of the oesophageal afferent pathways involved in oesophago-pharyngeal reflexes and oesophageal nociception. Disturbances of reflexes governing contractile and relaxation responses of the upper oesophageal sphincter (DOS) are likely to be implicated in the pathophysiology of conditions involving excessive oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation, impaired oesophageal clearance, and an abnormal belch reflex. Visceral hypersensitivity, a heightened perception of gastrointestinal sensation is frequently observed in functional gastrointestinal disorders and provides compelling evidence that it plays an important role in the pathogenesis of functional heartburn and non-erosive reflux disease.  The work in this thesis explores the neurophysiology, pharmacology and pathophysiology of oesophago-DOS reflexes in humans by experimentally inducing DOS relaxations in healthy controls and patients with reflux laryngitis, and by recording DOS motor responses during spontaneous oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. Nociception was assessed by measuring oesophageal sensitivity to electrical stimulation and oesophageal acid perfusion in healthy controls, which was then compared with several heartburn populations (functional heartburn, erosive and non-erosive reflux disease). Additional studies were performed to evaluate the potential role of intraluminal impedance in defining antegrade bolus flow through the pharyngo-oesophageal segment during swallowing as a prelude to the adaptation of the technique to find a more accurate method for the detection of oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation.  The main findings from this work are as follows. 1) Mucosal lignocaine-sensitive afferents mediate the distension-induced oesophago-DOS relaxation reflex and lignocaine insensitive, presumably muscular mechanoceptors, mediate the distension-induced oesophago-DOS contractile reflex. The latter reflex is also upregulated by oesophageal acidification indicative of a possible protective mechanism. 2) Prolonged studies in patients with proven oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation demonstrated that the most common mechanism of oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation is a transient, non-swallow related, relaxation of the DOS. 3) Experimental evaluation of the oesophago-DOS relaxation reflex revealed that it is upregulated in patients with reflux laryngitis, suggesting that the aberrant afferent signalling in the oesophagus may be a contributory factor mediating oesophago-pharyngeal regurgitation. 4) Measurement of oesophageal sensory thresholds in response to electrical stimulation and acid perfusion revealed that all patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of mucosal injury, exhibit acid-induced hypersensitisation. 5) The viscro-somatic referral pattern of acid- and electrically-induced chest pain is increased in patients with functional heartburn and non-erosive reflux disease. These findings support the hypothesis that central sensitisation of nociceptive pathways may contribute to symptom reporting in these heartburn populations.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pharynx.</field><field name="subject">Neurophysiology.</field><field name="subject">Pharmacology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">US foreign policy, the Arab-Israeli dispute and the ??Peace Process?? Mirage: Lausanne 1949 and Camp David 2000</field><field name="creator">Blomeley, Kristen Nicole, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis is to understand why the Arab-Israeli conflict has remained irreconcilable for sixty-one years.  While the details and forms of the conflict have changed over time, the central factors dividing Zionists and Arabs in the Middle East have altered little.  In this thesis I examine what these factors are and why they have been so effective in frustrating every peace effort. To understand the fundamental factors which keep the dispute alive I have conducted a comparative study of the two major peace initiatives which frame it diplomatically.  The first formal peace conference between Israel and her Arab adversaries took place in Lausanne in 1949.  The issues of borders, Jerusalem and refugees would not be seriously engaged with again until the last peace effort to date, the Camp David talks of 2000.  Through a detailed comparative analysis of both conferences I seek to understand the positions taken by the warring parties towards these issues and the broader motivating factors separating them and preventing them from achieving peace.  As the most important third party and supposed ??honest broker?? in both talks, I also closely examine the behaviour and policy of the US at each case. I find that the positions taken towards each issue by Israel, on the one hand, and the Arab party, on the other, were remarkably consistent in 1949 and 2000.  Israel was not fully committed to peace in either instance, while the Arabs twice refused to sign what amounted to documents of surrender.  These consistent positions starkly contrasted with that of the US, which completely changed its positions in ways which, by 2000, had almost wholly aligned it with Zionist demands. I conclude that future peace will rest on the ability of each party to re-examine its past in order to produce a spirit of reconciliation.  For Israel, this will mean honestly revisiting Zionism in order to confront what its triumph meant for the Palestinian inhabitants of the land.  The Arabs must also seek a broader understanding of their role in the dispute and demonstrate forcefully to Israelis that they seek peace rather than retribution.  Above all, if the US is to retain its role as mediator it must abandon its ??special relationship?? with Israel and return to a more genuinely?? even handed alignment with the broader international consensus on the dispute.  As it stands, the US??s more or less unconditional support of Israel has the effect of leading Israelis and Palestinians ever further from peace even as an ever more empty ??peace process?? is rhetorically trumpeted abroad.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Camp David</field><field name="subject">Middle East</field><field name="subject">Peace Process</field><field name="subject">Lausanne</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44396</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of bipolar disorder susceptibility genes</field><field name="creator">McAuley, Erica Zoe, Prince of Wales Medical Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Bipolar affective disorder is a severe mood disorder, which is characterised by episodes of mania and depression. The aetiology of bipolar disorder remains elusive, with little known about the underlying biological, anatomical, or biochemical effects. However, family, twin and adoption studies provide evidence for a strong genetic component to the disorder. Due to the high heritability, familial clustering, and common population prevalence of the illness, molecular genetic studies can be implemented to identify bipolar disorder susceptibility genes. This thesis investigated the candidate gene serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), which lay within a region on chromosome 13q14 previously identified by bipolar disorder genome-wide linkage scans. Significant association was found with bipolar disorder and a SNP within intron 2 of HTR2A in an Australian case-control cohort. Haplotype association analysis identified a 5-SNP protective haplotype within HTR2A. Conducting a new genome-wide linkage scan on 35 Australian bipolar disorder pedigrees found significant evidence for linkage on chromosome 15q25-26. Subsequent fine-mapping of the region verified the linkage peak with a significant maximum multipoint LOD score of 4.58. Haplotype analysis, based on pedigree-specific, identical-by-descent allele sharing, supported the location of a bipolar susceptibility gene within a 6.2Mb confidence interval. The candidate gene sialyltransferase 8B (ST8SIA2), which had previously shown association with SNPs within the gene&#146;s promoter region and schizophrenia in two independent Asian cohorts, lies within the chromosome 15q25-26 locus. Failing to replicate the association found with these specific SNPs, and without finding association with two additional SNPs in an upstream conserved putative regulatory region, a fine-mapping association study was conducted across the entire 6.2Mb interval. The strongest association signals were observed at SNPs 16kb upstream from and within the fourth intron of ST8SIA2. A specific bipolar disorder risk haplotype was identified for ST8SIA2, and this was also observed to be over-represented in a cohort of Australian schizophrenia cases. This finding suggests that the ST8SIA2 gene, for which strong developmental regulation was observed, may be a shared susceptibility gene for both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. In summary, this thesis has provided evidence identifying both HTR2A and ST8SIA2 as bipolar disorder susceptibility genes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Susceptibility genes</field><field name="subject">Bipolar disorder</field><field name="subject">Genetics</field><field name="subject">Association study</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43690</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Emergence of community-acquired, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in South Western Sydney</field><field name="creator">Gosbell, Iain Bruce, South Western Sydney Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Problem: Novel community-acquired, non-multiresistant strains of oxacillin- (methicillin-) resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA) have emerged in many parts of the globe. Little is known of the clinical features, the epidemiology, and the antibiotic treatment of these strains.  Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients presenting to Emergency Departments or Dermatology Clinics with staphylococcal infections. Patients were stratified into three groups, non-multiresistant ORSA (NORSA), multiresistant ORSA (MORSA) and oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus, and clinical comparisons made. Strains of NORSA and MORSA were typed using antibiograms, phage typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Antimicrobial studies were performed to compare different methods of detecting resistance to oxacillin and to non-beta-lactams. Time-kill studies were performed with one drug to explore killing kinetics. The interaction between drug combinations was examined using disk approximation and time-kill methodologies. A single point pharmacodynamic analysis was performed.  Results: There was an increase in infections with NORSA, MORSA and OSSA. NORSA strains appeared to be more virulent than OSSA and MORSA strains. NORSA was strongly associated with skin and soft tissue infections and with Polynesians. Most of the NORSA strains were related to New Zealand ????Western Samoan Phage Pattern???? (WSPP) isolates, and unrelated to community-acquired, non-multiresistant MRSA strains from Western Australia. Two patients were found to have British EMRSA-15 strains. NORSA strains were unrelated to MORSA strains. Resistance to rifampicin, fusidic acid, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim emerged in the time-kill assays. Combinations of antibiotics, particularly with ciprofloxacin, often showed antagonism. Gentamicin, fusidic acid, clindamycin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, and linezolid were predicted to perform well. Ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, doxycycline, flucloxacillin and quinupristin/dalfopristin were predicted to fail.  Conclusions: WSPP strains of New Zealand and EMRSA-15 strains from Britain exist in South Western Sydney. These organisms are virulent, and increasing in incidence in several areas of Australia. Antimicrobial treatment of infections with these strains is problematic and requires further study.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Staphylococcus aureus</field><field name="subject">Oxacillin</field><field name="subject">methicillin</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">South Western Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19050</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Empowering and disempowering indigenes : staging Aboriginal experience</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Khairul, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study offers an exploration of the drama which contains Aboriginal people's effort to attain a visible reality based on cultural and political rights. It is also a deeper understanding of the empowering and disempowering Indigenes in the discursive domain as well as in the existential reality. Though the study considers a large number of playtexts written by the Indigenous playwrights from 1970s to the present, it explores playtexts written by non-Indigenous playwrights as well. Here, the chief concern is to explore the discursive features of the texts, the items both linguistic and dramatic that tend to place or exclude Aboriginal people from discourses. Such a consideration may very well go beyond the periodic consideration of the plays. The Aboriginal theatre movement started in the 1970s serves as the complete reconceptualisation of Aboriginality in terms of centering Aboriginal Identity and culture in the dominant discursive domain. Such an intervention may involve the recovery of Aboriginal history from the dominant history of Australia and infusing positive attributes to Indigenes' identity. It also provides force in their existential reality. Freed from submission to the dominant's prescription, the drama appears as an alternative formula, but a rigorously vibrant medium of contestation in which history, identity, culture, politics and reality are endlessly expressive and persuasive.  Keeping with the need to expose the complexity of the process of empowering and disempowering Indigenes, I read the discursive strategies employed in a selection of playtexts.  The empowering drama adds dignity to Aboriginal people's gesture of friendship and goodwill and contrasts with the representation of aggressive colonial one. The drama exposes the encounter between negative and positive features in the representation of Aboriginality, thereby suggesting fighting against the authoritative design involves the representation of Indigenes in their terms. The most significant element the empowering drama contributes is its ability to capture the experience of the struggle of Indigenes to survive since colonisation. Aboriginal drama focuses more on the strategies to unsettle the dominant system than on the social order and the context. The final paradox is the act of inclusion and exclusion of Indigenes to/from the dominant theatrical discourses that indicate a fine line between empowerment and disempowerment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drama</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41107</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of the flow and combustion of pulverized coal injected in ironmaking blast furnace</field><field name="creator">Shen, Yansong, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pulverized coal injection (PCI) technology is widely practised in blast furnace ironmaking due to economic, operational and environmental benefits. High burnout of pulverized coal in the tuyere and raceway is required for high PCI rate operation. A comprehensive review reveals that although there have been a variety of PCI models, there is still an evident need for a more realistic model for PCI operation in blast furnace.  Aiming to build a comprehensive PCI model of a full-scale blast furnace, this thesis presents a series of three-dimensional mathematical models, in terms of model development, validation and application, in a sequence from a pilot-scale to a full-scale, from a simple to complicated geometry, from a coal only system to a coupled coal/coke system. Firstly a three-dimensional model of pulverized coal combustion is developed and applied to a pilot-scale PCI test rig. This model is validated against the measurements from two pilot-scale test rigs in terms of gas species composition and coal burnout. The gas-solid flow and coal combustion are simulated and analysed. The results indicate that the model is able to describe the evolutions of coal particles and provide detailed gas species distributions. It is also sensitive to various parameters and hence robust in examining various blast furnace operations. This model is then extended to examine the combustion of coal blends. The coal blend model is also validated against the experimental results for a range of coal blends conditions. The overall performance of a coal blend and the individual behaviours of its component coals are analysed. More importantly, the synergistic effect of coal blending on overall burnout is examined and the underlying mechanisms are explored. It is indicated that such synergistic effect can be optimized by adjusting the blending fraction, so as to compensate for the decreased burnout under high coal rate operation. The model provides an effective tool for the optimum design of coal blends.  As a scale-up phase, the coal combustion model is applied to the blowpipe-tuyereraceway region of a full-scale blast furnace, where the raceway is simplified as a tube with a slight expansion. The in-furnace phenomena are simulated and analysed, focusing on the main coal plume. The effect of cooling gas conditions on combustion behaviours is investigated. Among the three types of cooling gas (methane, air, and oxygen), oxygen gives the highest coal burnout.  Finally, a three-dimensional integrated mathematical model of pulverized coaVcoke combustion is developed. The model is applied to the blowpipe-tuyere-raceway-coke bed region of a full-scale blast furnace, which features a complicated raceway geometry and coke bed properties. The model is validated against the measurements in terms of coal burnout from a test rig and gas composition from a blast furnace, respectively. The model gives a comprehensive full-scale picture of the flow and thermo-chemical characteristics of PCI process. The typical operational parameters are then examined in terms of coal burnout and gas composition. It is indicated that the final burnout along the tuyere axis is insensitive to some operational parameters. The average burnout over the raceway surface can better represent the amount of unburnt coal particles entering the surrounding coke bed and it is also found to be more sensitive to the changes of most parameters. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of coal combustion are obtained. The coal burnout strongly depends on both oxygen availability and residence time. The existence of recirculation region gives a more realistic coal particle residence time and burnout. Compared with the fore-mentioned two models, this model is considered as a more comprehensive model of PCI operation for understanding the infurnace behaviours and provides more reliable information for the design of operational parameters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Coal -- Combustion -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Blast furnaces.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41108</field></doc><doc><field name="title">To labour seriously : Catholic sisters and social welfare in late nineteenth century Sydney</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Lesley Patricia, School of Social Work, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the social welfare work of four Catholic Sisterhoods in Sydney in the late nineteenth century.  The work of Catholic women religious is largely missing from Australian women???s history and the history of social welfare and social work in Australia.  The present investigation seeks to add to knowledge of women???s agency in Australian society and to extend the knowledge of Australian social work history. The aim of the thesis is to understand what the Sisters were attempting to do in their work with the poor of Sydney and how they went about it.  The emphasis is on understanding the Sisters??? work from their own perspective, particularly the values which underpinned their work and the resources and constraints which affected it.  A qualitative, inductive approach is used in which the data are drawn mainly from the Sisterhoods??? narratives and other historical documents.  The thesis does  not aim to test particular theoretical propositions, but rather to contribute to a number of ???unfolding stories??? about the history of Australian social work, about women???s work in the public realm, and about the development of the caring professions The thesis argues that the social welfare work of four Sydney Sisterhoods had a number of characteristics which made it unusual for the time, and which constituted it as ???proto-professional???.  These included the codification of the prescribed stance towards the poor, of methods of work, and a high level of expertise in administration and management.  The Sisters??? approach pre-figured later social work in a number of respects including an inclusive and accepting stance, respect for the dignity of the individual, and a concern to develop individuals??? capacities and self-esteem.  The professionalism of the Sisters??? work is shown to be related to features which were integral to Catholic women???s religious institutes and to their role and status in the Catholic Church of the day. The Sisters??? social welfare work did not ???evolve??? into secular, professional social work however.  It is contended that reasons for this were related to developments in Australian society, the situation of the local Catholic Church and restrictions on membership of the Sisterhoods.  The thesis has significance for bodies of knowledge on ???woman???s sphere??? charity in the late nineteenth century, the history of social work in Australia, and theory on the professionalisation of caring occupations.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social welfare</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="subject">19th century</field><field name="subject">Church and social problems</field><field name="subject">Catholic Church</field><field name="subject">Nuns</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Turing machines, computers and artificial intelligence.</field><field name="creator">Krebs, Peter R., History &amp; Philosophy of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates some of the issues and consequences for the field of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, which are related to the perceived limits of computation with current digital equipment. The Church -Turing thesis and the specific properties of Turing machines are examined and some of the philosophical 'in principle' objections, such as the application of G??del's incompleteness theorem, are discussed. It is argued that the misinterpretation of the Church-Turing thesis has led to unfounded assumptions about the limitations of computing machines in general. Modern digital computers, which are based on the von Neuman architecture, can typically be programmed so that they interact effectively with the real word. It is argued that digital computing machines are supersets of Turing machines, if they are, for example, programmed to interact with the real world. Moreover, computing is not restricted to the domain of discrete state machines. Analog computers and real or simulated neural nets exhibit properties that may not be accommodated in a definition of computing, which is based on Turing machines. Consequently, some of the philosophical 'in principle' objections to artificial intelligence may not apply in reference to engineering efforts in artificial intelligence.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Turing machines</field><field name="subject">computers</field><field name="subject">artificial intelligence</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="subject">Church-Turing thesis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Probing variations in the fundamental constants with quasar absorption lines</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Michael T., Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Precision cosmology challenges many aspects of fundamental physics. In particular, quasar absorption lines test the assumed constancy of fundamental constants over cosmological time-scales and distances. Until recently, the most reliable technique was the alkali doublet (AD) method where the measured doublet separation probes variations in the fine-structure constant, ???? e2/??c. However, the recently introduced many-multiplet (MM) method provides several advantages, including a demonstrated ???10-fold precision gain. This thesis presents detailed MM analyses of 3 independent Keck/HIRES samples containing 128 absorption systems with 0.2 &amp;gt zabs &amp;gt 3.7. We find 5.6 ?? statistical evidence for a smaller ?? in the absorption clouds: ????/?? = (-0.574 ?? 0.102) x 10-5. All three samples separately yield consistent, significant ????/??. The data marginally prefer constant d??/dt rather than constant ????/??. The two-point correlation function for ?? and the angular distribution of ????/?? give no evidence for spatial variations. We also analyse 21 Keck/HIRES Si iv doublets, obtaining a 3-fold relative precision gain over previous AD studies: ????/?? = (-0.5 ?? 1.3) x 10-5 for 2.0 &amp;gt zabs &amp;gt 3.1. Our statistical evidence for varying ?? requires careful consideration of systematic errors. Modelling demonstrates that atmospheric dispersion is potentially important. However, the quasar spectra suggest a negligible effect on ????/??. Cosmological variation in Mg isotopic abundances may affect ????/?? at zabs &amp;gt 1.8. Galactic observations and theory suggest diminished 25;26Mg abundances in the low metallicity quasar absorbers. Removing 25;26Mg isotopes yields more negative ????/?? values. Overall, known systematic errors can not explain our results. We also constrain variations in y ?? ?? 2gp, comparing H i 21-cm and millimetrewave molecular absorption in 2 systems. Fitting both the H i and molecular lines yields the tightest, most reliable current constraints: ??y/y = (-0.20??0.44)x10-5 and (-0.16??0.54)x10-5 at zabs = 0.2467 and 0.6847 respectively. Possible line-ofsight velocity differences between the H i and molecular absorbing regions dominate these 1 ?? errors. A larger sample of mm/H i comparisons is required to reliably quantify this uncertainty and provide a potentially crucial check on the MM result.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fine-structure constant</field><field name="subject">Quasars</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improved generation operation of an induction machine based automotive integrated starter alternator</field><field name="creator">Mudannayake, Chathura Prasanna, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis proposes improved techniques for controlling of induction machine based integrated starter alternator in order to achieve the challenging requirements of future automotive on-board power system. The proposed techniques are focused on improving DC voltage regulation, maximum power extraction and efficiency improvements. A new sophisticated DC voltage controller that provides tight voltage regulation is proposed. The proposed controller is based on a linearized model for the combined inverter and induction machine. The proposed DC controller is included with speed and flux decoupling and an antiwindup technique. Extensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate the excellent DC voltage control performance of the proposed DC controller over a wide speed range and under various operating conditions. This thesis proposes an improved field weakening implementation which is based on stator voltage control for maximum power extraction in generation mode. The controllers in proposed implementation included use a non-linear dynamic compensator (NDC), stator frequency decoupling and an anti-windup technique. This thesis investigates and eliminates the oscillation in high speed field weakening region caused when large loads are applied. The proposed implementation also provides better regulation for the stator voltage and stable operation over a wide speed range in the generation mode of the ISA. The proposed implementation allows extracting significant amount of additional power compared to conventional field weakening technique. The simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the performance of the proposed implementation for ISA. A new loss minimised control method for the integrated starter alternator based on a loss model of the system was developed. The loss model operates in dq &#8722; axes and takes into account the inverter and the machine losses. The experimental results demonstrates that proposed loss minimised control provides significant efficiency improvements under light load condition of the ISA. This thesis also presents complete modeling of ISA, an extensive study on induction machine parameter variations and overall control design of the ISA system. The extensive simulation and experimental studies presented in this thesis clearly demonstrates the development of a new ISA which is low-cost, optimised for high efficiency and maximised power over a wide speed range and excellent DC bus voltage regulation under all conditions of generation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Automotive</field><field name="subject">Integrated starter alternator</field><field name="subject">Induction generator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43664</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Wake survey behind a rotating ventilator</field><field name="creator">Rashid, Dewan Md. Harunur, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With environmental concern growing in both affluent and developing countries, roof top ventilators, a form of natural ventilation requiring only wind energy to ensure quality air circulation and comfort is becoming a considered choice of many households and industries. Unfortunately, however, many of these ventilators have evolved through trial and error and the flow physics associated with these ventilators is barely understood. The present experimental project was, therefore, undertaken as part of UNSW- Industry collaboration program funded under an Australian Research Council Grant to explore whether the aerodynamics forces acting on these ventilators during their operation could be obtained. A commercial roof top ventilator supplied by industry was, therefore, tested in an open jet wind tunnel of the University of New South Wales and the results are presented in this thesis.   A novel feature of this project is the examination of the suitability of ???the three dimensional wake traverse??? technique to the wake of rotating ventilator. This technique has so far been applied with limited success to the wake of lifting bodies of fixed wing configuration only. In the absence of adequate data in the literature on rotating ventilator, the aerodynamics force components obtained by this technique have been compared against force balance measurements. The results show that the wake traverse technique is capable of determining lift and total drag forces associated with the ventilator flow during its operation from the pressure and velocity information gathered downstream of a ventilator in its wake. Generally, from these data, the technique also allows isolation of the profile and induced components of the drag force. However, from the induced drag value, while it is possible to determine the lift force, it is however, found that a more accurate value of lift force can be evaluated using axial vorticity formulation.   The availability of the above technique which does not require measurements on the test specimen itself, will aid in providing a cost efficient investigation of the aerodynamic forces and consequently the performance of a roof top ventilator.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wake survey</field><field name="subject">rotating ventilator</field><field name="subject">ventilation</field><field name="subject">heating and ventilation control</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19076</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene expression during activation of smooth muscle cells</field><field name="creator">Tan, Yu Yin Nicole, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cardiovascular disease, which involves the cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular system, is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the western world.

The aim of this thesis was to increase our understanding on the molecular regulation of activated vascular smooth muscle cells. The first study looking at PDGF-D expression provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the phosphorylation of Sp1. Studies performed identified three amino acids in Sp1 (Thr668, Ser670 and Thr681) that is phosphorylated by PKC-zeta activated by AngII. In the second study, the translational regulatory role of a novel gene YrdC induced by injury was investigated. Current knowledge of translational regulators controlling altered gene expression is little and studies in this thesis shows a splice variant of YrdC playing an important role in controlling mRNA translation and thus protein synthesis in the context of injury. The final study investigated in this study was the increased expression of the apoptotic FasL by the activation of GATA6. Although FasL has been extensively studied over the years, this is the first study linking a GATA factor with FasL in any cell type and provides key insights into the transcriptional events underpinning FasL-dependent SMC apoptosis following exposure to AngII.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gata6</field><field name="subject">Sp1</field><field name="subject">YrdC</field><field name="subject">FasL</field><field name="subject">Smooth muscle cells</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Phosphorylation</field><field name="subject">Platelet derived growth factor D (PDGF-D)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Non-invasive procedure for fetal electrocardiography</field><field name="creator">Fox, Alice J Sophia, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Antenatal fetal surveillance is a field of increasing importance in modern obstetrics. Measurements extracted (such as fetal heart rate) from antenatal fetal monitoring techniques have the potential to reduce the social, personal and financial burdens of fetal death on families, health care systems and the community. Techniques to monitor the fetus through pregnancy have been developed with the aim of providing information to enable the clinician to diagnose fetal wellbeing, characterise development and detect abnormality. An early diagnosis before delivery may increase the effectiveness of the appropriate treatment. Over the years, various research efforts have been carried out in the field of fetal electrocardiography by attaching surface electrodes to the maternal body. Unfortunately the desired fetal heartbeat signals at the electrode output are buried in an additive mixture of undesired interference disturbances. In this thesis, a non-invasive fetal electrocardiogram machine has been designed, constructed and implemented. This machine is composed of three modified electrocardiogram circuits and an external soundcard. Data was acquired from four surface electrodes placed on the maternal body. Eleven pregnant subjects, with a gestation age between the 30th and 40th weeks of pregnancy, were used to investigate the validity of this machine. Fetal R-waves were detected in 72.7 percent of subjects. The development of a non-invasive machine, capable of detecting and recording valuable anatomic and electrophysiological information of a fetus, represents an important tool in clinical and investigative obstetrics.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fetal surveillance</field><field name="subject">fetal electrocardiography</field><field name="subject">fetal heart rate</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41240</field></doc><doc><field name="title">ALICIA polycrystalline silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="creator">Inns, Daniel, Photovoltaics &amp; Renewable Energy Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film silicon photovoltaics are seen as a good possibility for reducing the cost of solar electricity.  The focus of this thesis is the ALICIA cell, a thin-film polycrystalline silicon solar cell made on a glass superstrate.  The name ALICIA comes from the fabrication steps - ALuminium Induced Crystallisation, Ion Assisted deposition.  The concept is to form a high-quality crystalline silicon layer on glass by Aluminium Induced Crystallisation (AIC).  This is then the template from which to epitaxially grow the solar cell structure by Ion Assisted Deposition (IAD).  IAD allows high-rate silicon epitaxy at low temperatures compatible with glass.  In thin-film solar cells, light trapping is critical to increase the absorption of the solar spectrum.  ALICIA cells have been fabricated on textured glass sheets, increasing light absorption due to their anti-reflection nature and light trapping properties.  A 1.8 &#956;m thick textured ALICIA cell absorbs 55% of the AM1.5G spectrum without a back-surface reflector, or 76% with an optimal reflector.  Experimentally, Pigmented Diffuse Reflectors (PDRs) have been shown to be the best reflector.  These highly reflective and optically diffuse materials increase the light-trapping potential and hence the short-circuit currents of ALICIA cells.  In textured cells, the current increased by almost 30% compared to using a simple aluminium reflector.  Current densities up to 13.7 mA/cm2 were achieved by application of a PDR to the best ALICIA cells. The electronic quality of the absorber layer of ALICIA cells is strongly determined by the epitaxy process.  Very high-rate epitaxial growth decreases the crystalline quality of the epitaxial layer, but nevertheless increases the short-circuit current density of the solar cells.  This indicates that the diffusion length in the absorber layer of the ALICIA cell is primarily limited by contamination, not crystal quality.  Further gains in current density can therefore be achieved by increasing the deposition rate of the absorber layer, or by improving the vacuum quality.  Large-area ALICIA cells were then fabricated, and series resistance reduced by using an interdigitated metallisation scheme.  The best measured efficiency was 2.65%, with considerable efficiency gains still possible from optimisation of the epitaxial growth and metallisation processes.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic</field><field name="subject">thin-film</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The active compression wave cochlear amplifier</field><field name="creator">Flax, Matthew Raphael, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates hair cell (He) homeostasis and the compression wave cochlear amplifier.  In the first part of the thesis, an accurate physiological treatment of a generic HC is conducted using a nonlinear distributed parameter physical model. This model includes the major ionic species (sodium, potassium and chlorine), defining the active cellular homeostatic properties. This model is used for transient response analysis. Resting state and transient responses of the HC model are in excellent agreement with the experimental literature. HCs in this model are most simply classified as instantaneous nonlinear transduction devices (i. e. their homeostatic mechanisms are not significantly frequency selective).  A compression wave cochlear amplifier (CW-CA) is defined and modelled for the first time in the second part of the thesis. It is a physiological model that addresses three main elements present in the peripheral hearing circuit: cochlear mechanics, HC nonlinearity, and neurology. The actual physiological feedback mechanism of the CW-CA is realistic.  A passive travelling wave (or other mechanical) vibration is the input to the system. Whilst the travelling wave wiggles the Organ of Corti, the compression wave pulsates it. The CW-CA is an alternative to the physiologically ill-defined locally active travelling wave cochlear feedback amplifier proposed by others. The new CW-CA model results in a cycle-by-cycle amplifier with nonlinear response. It is capable of assuming an infinite number of different operating states. The stable and first few amplitude-limited unstable states are significant in describing the operation of the peripheral hearing system. The CW-CA model can explain a large number of hearing phenomena. Several of these are investigated by means of a system analysis for both the stable and unstable cases. The system is studied and the tone, two-tone suppression and distortion product responses are found to align well with published results. Explanations for various mechanical, HC and neurological phenomena are discussed and presented. For example, previously poorly understood phenomena such as otoacoustic emissions and neural spontaneous rates are accounted for.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Homeostasis</field><field name="subject">Amplifiers (Electronics)</field><field name="subject">Hair cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Southern hemisphere regional precipitation and climate variability : extrems trends and prdictability</field><field name="creator">Ummenhofer, Caroline C, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This PhD thesis investigates the relative importance of oceanic and atmospheric influences on extremes, long-term trends, and seasonal to interannual variability of precipitation for different regions in the Southern Hemisphere in observations, reanalysis data, and output from general circulation models (GCM).  Examination of interannual rainfall extremes over southwest Western Australia (SWWA) reveals a characteristic dipole pattern of Indian Ocean sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA). This coincides with a large-scale reorganization of the wind field over the tropical/subtropical Indian Ocean changing SSTA, via anomalous Ekman transport in the tropical Indian Ocean and via anomalous air-sea heat fluxes in the subtropics, and altering moisture advection onto SWWA. The potential impact of these Indian Ocean SSTA in driving modulations of mid-latitude precipitation across southern and western regions of Australia is assessed in atmospheric GCM simulations. The SSTA give rise to changes in the thermal properties of the atmosphere, meridional thickness gradient, subtropical jet, thermal wind, and baroclinicity over southern regions of Australia, thus modulating precipitation. In addition, links between anomalous wet conditions over East Africa and these characteristic Indian Ocean SSTA are explored during the "short rain" season in October-November.  Interannual extremes m New Zealand rainfall and their modulation by modes of Southern Hemisphere climate variability, namely the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), are investigated. Late twentieth Century trends in New Zealand precipitation are examined for the period 19792006 to quantify the relative impact of recent changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation related to the SAM and ENSO. Increasingly drier conditions over much of New Zealand can be partially explained by the SAM and ENSO. Cool season rainfall variability in southeastern Australia is investigated via a classification and characterization of the predominant types of synoptic systems occurring in the region, focusing on frontal and cutoff low systems. Two definitions of the autumn break developed for northwestern Victoria are employed to produce a synoptic climatology of the break phenomenon. Trends in characteristics of the autumn break indicate that the most recent drought in southeastern Australia is comparable in severity with the two major droughts in the twentieth Century.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southern Hemisphere -- Climate</field><field name="subject">Precipitation (Meteorology) -- Computer simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiphase flow in packed beds with special reference to ironmaking blast furnace</field><field name="creator">Chen, Matthew Lidong, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multi-phase flows can be found in a range of processes in vanous industries. Ironrnaking blast furnace is one of the typical examples. With high pulverized coal injection rates, complete combustion within the raceway of blast furnace becomes difficult, giving rise to a large amount of powder flow together with gases into the furnace. Thus, the performance of a modern blast furnace with high PCI strongly depends on the characteristics of a multiphase system which involves gas, powder, and liquid superimposed on the motion of solid particles. For this multiphase flow system, the solid (coke, sinter/pellets, etc) movement and liquids (hot metal and slag) and powders (unbumt coal and coke ash) accumulation in the lower region of the furnace are believed to play an important role. This thesis presents an experimental study focus on quantifying the hydrodynamics of gas-powder and gas-powder-liquid flows through packed beds with special reference to blast furnace. The effects of process variables including fluid flowrate and some material properties on powder hold-up, pressure gradient and phase interaction are examined.  An experimental study of the hydrodynamics of gas-powder flow in packed beds has been carried out. Glass powder and spherical/non-spherical particles are used to simulate pulverized coal and coke particle respectively. It is found that solid motion, powder flowrate and particle spericity affect powder hold-up and pressure gradient significantly. New correlations are proposed for static and dynamic powder hold-ups to account for these effects based on experimental results. A hydrodynamic model is proposed for gas-powder flow in packed beds with spherical and non-spherical particles. Incorporation these correlations and porosity function into the existed Fanning and Ergun equations, the pressure gradients in fixed and moving beds can be reasonably estimated.  The gas-powder-liquid flow through the moving beds is studied. The effects of fluid variables and some material properties on total powder hold-up and pressure gradients have been examined experimentally within the so-called operational regime. The normal and non-wetting treated glass beads, glass powder and water or mixture of water and glycerin are used to simulate coke, pulverized coal and hot metal/slag in a blast furnace. The results indicates that steady-state gas-powder-liquid flow in moving packed beds can be achieved under certain flow conditions since particle motion gives main contribution while it provides a higher bed porosity, enhances powder and liquid flow and removes the accumulation of the powder. The fluid variables and liquid viscosity significantly affect the total powder hold-up and hence pressure gradient but the wettability does not. Based on the experimental results, new correlations for powder hold-up and pressure gradient are proposed for blast furnace modelling in terms of dimensionless number of flowrates for different phases. Incorporation of these correlations and the existed empirical correlations of phase interactions, a hydrodynamic model is proposed to quantify the interaction force between liquid and powder. The results show that this force plays an important role for stable gas-powder-liquid flow in moving beds though it is ignored by most of the previous researchers.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Blast furnaces.</field><field name="subject">Multiphase flow.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41354</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic framework of recovering process patterns from project enactment data as inputs to software process improvement</field><field name="creator">Huo, Ming, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study of the software development process is a relatively new research area but it is growing rapidly. This development process, also called 'the software life cycle' or 'the software process', is the methodology used throughout the industry for the planning, design, implementation, testing and maintenance that takes place during the creation of a software product. Over the years a variety of different process models have been developed. From the numerous process models now available, project managers need validation of the choice he/she has made for a software development model that he/she believes will provide the best results. Yet the quality software so sought after by software project managers can be enhanced by improving the development process through which it is delivered. Well tested, reliable evidence is needed to assist these project managers in choosing and planning a superior software process as well as for improving the adopted software process. While some guidelines for software process validation and improvement have been provided, such as CMMI, quantitative evidence is, in fact, scarce. The quantitative evidence sometimes may not be able to be obtained from high level processes that refer to a planned process model, such as a waterfall model. Furthermore, there has been little analysis of low level processes. These low level processes refer to the actions of how a development team follow a high level software process model to develop a software product. We describe these low level processes as project enactment. Normally there is a gap between the high level software process and the project enactment. In order to improve this software development process, this gap needs to be identified, measured and analyzed. In this dissertation, we propose an approach that examines the deviation between a planned process model and the project enactment of that plan. We measure the discrepancy from two aspects: consistency and inconsistency. The analytical results of the proposed approach, which include both qualitative and quantitative data, provide powerful and precise evidence for tailoring, planning and selecting any software process model. The entire approach is composed of four major phases: 1) re-presentation of the planned process model, 2) pre-processing the low level process data, 3) process mining, and 4) analysis and comparison of the recovered process model and planned process model. We evaluate the proposed approach in three case studies: a small, a medium, and a large-sized project obtained from an industrial software development organization. The appropriate data on low level processes is collected and our approach is then applied to these projects individually. From each case study we then performed a detailed analysis of the inconsistencies that had surfaced as well as the consistencies between the plan and the enactment models. An analysis of the inconsistencies revealed that several 'agile' practices were introduced during the project's development even though the planned process model was initially based on 'ISO-12207' instead of the 'agile' method. In addition, our analysis identifies the patterns in the process that are frequently repeated. The outcome of the case studies shows that our approach is applicable to a range of software projects. The conclusions derived from these case studies confirmed that our approach could be used to enhance the entire software development process, including tailoring and assessment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Software process recovery</field><field name="subject">Software process mining</field><field name="subject">Software process models</field><field name="subject">Agile methods</field><field name="subject">Software process modeling</field><field name="subject">Project enactment</field><field name="subject">Software process lifecycle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43683</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitric oxide in airway inflammation</field><field name="creator">Liu, Jia, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a non-invasive method of investigating airway inflammation associated with nitric oxide (NO) and the metabolites nitrite/nitrates (NOx) in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but some of the variables affecting the results are unknown.  It was hypothesised that 1) EBC would be influenced by lung volumes and the type of EBC collection device; 2) fractional exhaled NO (FENO) and EBC NOx in COPD patients would be altered by smoking and glucocorticosteroids (GCS); 3) cigarette smoke could contribute to the EBC NOx concentration while it may also decrease FENO indirectly by converting airway NO to NOx.  It was found that EBC volume was significantly correlated with both tidal volume and minute volume. Comparing four EBC collection devices demonstrated greater efficiency with the ECoScreen?? than siliconised glass tubes or RTube?? but it gave factitiously high NOx levels. Total EBC protein levels over a 10-minute collection were significantly higher using the ECoScreen?? than either glass or RTube?? devices. A cross-sectional study of 96 COPD patients and 80 age-matched control subjects demonstrated that FENO levels in COPD patients were significantly higher than normal subjects when comparing either the combined groups or appropriate two subgroups: ex-smokers and smokers. GCS treatment demonstrated no significant effect on either FENO levels or EBC NOx, but EBC NOx was elevated in smokers. In vitro, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induced significantly higher NOx and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels in A549 cells when compared with control media. The anti-oxidant, NAC pre-treatment partially reversed the elevated NOx levels but not the ADMA levels.  This thesis is the first to report FENO and EBC NOx in COPD patients in an appropriate sample size to be able to evaluate each subgroup, and the increased EBC NOx levels found in smokers in vivo was consistent with the elevated NOx level in response to CSE observed in vitro. These data indicate that smoking-related airway inflammation and activation of the NO pathway are complex with both an increase in ADMA, NO, NOx and may be regulated by oxidative stress rather than the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Exhaled breath condensate</field><field name="subject">Exhaled nitric oxide</field><field name="subject">Nitrite/nitrate</field><field name="subject">Smoking</field><field name="subject">ADMA</field><field name="subject">COPD</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43678</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power analysis side channel attacks: the processor design-level context</field><field name="creator">Ambrose, Jude Angelo, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rapid increase in the use of embedded systems for performing secure transactions, has proportionally increased the security threats which are faced by such devices. Side channel attack, a sophisticated security threat to embedded devices like smartcards, mobile phones and PDAs, exploits the external manifestations like processing time, power consumption and electromagnetic emission to identify the internal computations. Power analysis attack, introduced by Kocher in 1998, is used by adversaries to eavesdrop on confidential data while the device is executing a secure transaction. The adversary observes the power trace dissipated/consumed by the chip during the encryption/decryption of the AES cryptographic program and predicts the secret key used for encryption by extracting necessary information from the power trace.  Countermeasures proposed to overcome power analysis are data masking, table masking, current flattening, circuitry level solutions, dummy instruction insertions, balancing bit-flips, etc. All these techniques are either susceptible to multi-order side channel attacks, not sufficiently generic to cover all encryption algorithms, or burden the system with high area cost, run-time or energy consumption.  The initial solution presented in this thesis is a HW/SW based randomised instruction injection technique, which infuses random instructions at random places during   the execution of an application. Such randomisation obfuscates the secure information from the power profile, not allowing the adversary to extract the critical power segments for analysis. Further, the author devised a systematic method to measure the security level of a power sequence and used it to measure the number of random instructions needed, to suitably confuse the adversary. The proposed  processor  model  costs  1.9% in additional area for a simplescalar processor, and costs on average 29.8%  in runtime and 27.1% in additional energy consumption for six industry standard cryptographic algorithms. This design is extended to a processor architecture which automatically detects the execution of the most common encryption algorithms, starts to scramble the power waveform by adding randomly placed instructions with random register accesses, and stops injecting instructions when it is safe to do so. This approach has less overheads compared to previous solutions and avoids software instrumentation, allowing programmers with no special knowledge to use the system.  The extended processor model costs an additional area of 1.2%, and an average of 25% in runtime and 28.5% in energy overheads for industry standard cryptographic algorithms.  Due to the possibility of removing random injections using large number of samples (due to the random nature, a large number of samples will eliminate noise), the author proposes a multiprocessor 'algorithmic' balancing technique. This technique uses a dual processor architecture where two processors execute the same program in parallel, but with complementary intermediate data, thus balancing the bitflips. The second processor works in conjunction with the first processor for balancing only when encryption is performed, and both processors carry out independent tasks when no encryption is being performed. Both DES and AES cryptographic programs are investigated for balancing and the author shows that this technique is economical, while completely preventing power analysis attacks. The signature detection unit to capture encryption is also utilised, which is used in the instruction injection approach. This multiprocessor balancing approach reduces performance by 0.42% and 0.94% for AES and DES respectively. The hardware  increase is 2X only when balancing is performed. Further, several future extensions for the balancing approach are proposed, by introducing random swapping of encryption iterations between cores. FPGA implementations of these processor designs are briefly described at the end of this thesis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System design</field><field name="subject">Side channel attacks</field><field name="subject">Power analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43756</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Retention of the anatase phase in TiO2 through the use of bauxite and zircon dopants</field><field name="creator">Hanaor, Dorian Amir Henry, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Preserving the anatase phase of TiO2 is of interest due to the photocatalytic activity of this phase, which is generally considered superior to rutile Ti02 due to a higher surface area. The retardation of the anatase to rutile transition through the use of low cost dopants, zircon and bauxite, was investigated. Pressed powder compacts of anatase TiO2 doped with varying levels of bauxite and zircon powders were fired at 1025??C for durations of 2, 3 and 4 hours. X-ray diffraction analysis, Scanning electron microscopy, Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy were used to evaluate the effect these dopants have on the transition to rutile.  It was found that both zircon and bauxite retard the transition to rutile in the solid state. Increasing the level of bauxite dopant consistently increases the preservation of the anatase phase. It was found that at levels of bauxite doping over 5 wt%, over 90% of the anatase phase is retained through 2 hour firing cycles.  Using EDS, zircon particles were observed to nucleate elongated prismatic rutile grains. Whilst XRD analysis showed that the addition of zircon has a marked effect on retarding the overall transition of anatase to rutile, increasing levels of this dopant over 2.5% brings about a reduction in preserved anatase, probably due to increased rutile nucleation. Findings showed Samples doped with 2.5% ZrSi04 retained approximately 95% anatase through 2 hour firing cycles.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bauxite.</field><field name="subject">Zircon.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pharmaceutical processing using dense gas technology</field><field name="creator">Barrett, Angela Mary, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">There exists a demand to re-engineer pre-existing pharmaceuticals to provide improved drug delivery, new dosage forms and increased drug safety and efficacy. Furthermore, the development of novel methods and formulations allows for the patent life of pre-existing drugs to be extended, which has obvious economic benefits for pharmaceutical companies. Dense gas technology provides a means to achieve these aims and to overcome the distinct limitations of traditional technologies.  A novel formulation of the antifungal drug itraconazole has been developed using gas antisolvent processes. The new itraconazole-polymer formulation displayed a significant improvement in dissolution rate achieving 89.8 % dissolution compared to 52.5 % for the commercial formulation. The results of this study demonstrate the great opportunity to use dense gases for the creation of novel drug-polymer composite formulations with improved dissolution properties.  The impregnation of an active ingredient into a polymer matrix is another method that can be used to improve the dissolution of poorly water soluble drugs. Dense gas technology has been incorporated into traditional methods for the formation of porous polymer matrices decreasing process residence times. However, some issues still need to be overcome including high operating temperatures and the use of class 3 solvents. A novel dense gas process for the formation of a porous polymer hydrogel matrix has been developed to improve upon current methodologies; Dense Gas Solvent Exchange Process (DGSEP).  The Dense Gas Solvent Exchange Process was used to create a porous chitosan hydrogel impregnated with a stable amorphous form of the drug griseofulvin. Furthermore, the process was extended to include a hydrophilic polymer into the matrix. The resulting formulation had a dramatically improved dissolution rate achieving complete dissolution within 70 minutes compared with the commercial formulation which achieved less than 40 %dissolution in the same time.  There is great potential for DGSEP to be applied to the formation of a variety of polymer hydrogels impregnated with active ingredients and incorporating polymers and other compounds. The significance of these results is that a simple and effective processing method has been developed to produce hydrogel systems that are suitable for the development of a diverse range of drug delivery systems.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drug delivery systems.</field><field name="subject">Pharmaceutical technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nigel Butterley??s string quartets: compositional processes from sketch to score</field><field name="creator">Watters-Cowan, Peter Edward, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Nigel (Henry) Butterley (b. 1935) is recognised as one of Australia??s foremost contemporary composers. His works span most compositional genres. By making a case for the value of sketch study in the process of musical analysis, the principal purpose of this thesis is to augment understanding of Butterley??s music and in particular, his compositional processes and procedures through the various stages of the genesis of a composition, from the sketch to final score. Butterley??s string quartets, composed between the years 1965 to 2001 provide the basis for this study; these works are contextualised and examined to illustrate his approach to composition in microcosm and also his individual style within the genre of string quartet writing.  This study focuses on the examination of preliminary sketches, drafts and holographs, as well as the scores of the completed works. Initially, analysis is based on preliminary sketches; this will be augmented by a formal analysis of the completed works. Traditionally, formal analysis deals with the final product, something that has been created, and in a sense, views a work retrospectively. Sketch study, in contrast, examines the work as it is being created and is concerned with the attendant compositional issues and choices available to the composer and the processes followed as he or she creates the composition.  The current work will identify significant common features in all the string quartets, and will trace Butterley??s compositional trajectory through these works demonstrating that individual characteristics of Butterley??s style, emergent as early as 1965, continued to be utilised in 1995 and remain present in the Bagatelle of 2001. That these characteristics remain present in a minut?? is significant, in that the Bagatelle may be seen as a microcosm of the writing style evident in his larger works.  This thesis will demonstrate that sketch study and formal analysis may interact in order to provide a more comprehensive interpretation of a composer??s work and enrich the understanding and appreciation of the compositional process and the final product, ultimately impacting on the realisation of a composer??s work through performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sketch</field><field name="subject">Butterley</field><field name="subject">Australian music</field><field name="subject">Analysis</field><field name="subject">String Quartet</field><field name="subject">Compositional process</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43676</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantum cellular automata and few-donor devices in silicon</field><field name="creator">Mitic, Mladen , Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates advanced silicon devices fabricated using phosphorous ion implantation. The novel devices presented are the silicon quantum cellular automata cell and the few-donor device implanted with controlled numbers of phosphorous donors. In addition, the thesis presents novel measurements of a phosphorous implanted silicon double-dot device, a crucial building block of a quantum cellular automata cell.  The devices were fabricated using standard lithographic techniques and, in the case of few-donor devices, a new method of controlled single ion implantation using on-chip detector electrodes. The positional accuracy of the implanted ions was achieved using a resist mask defined by electron beam lithography. A series of subsequent process steps has also been developed to repair the substrate implantation damage, define surface control gates, and to define single electron transistors used for readout via the detection of sub-electron charge transfer signals in the device.  The device operations were achieved at mK-temperatures using various measurement techniques. In the case of quantum cellular automata cells, the device operation was demonstrated directly by switching the polarization of the cells from one logic state to another and detecting the corresponding change in the electrostatic environment using single-electron transistors. The control gate limits necessary for stable QCA cell operation were also determined, indirectly demonstrating QCA logic state switching. The double-dot device operation was demonstrated using SET detection in both linear and for the first time in non-linear regimes. In addition, source-drain conductance detection of charge states, simultaneous detection using single-electron transistors and source-drain conductance, and source-drain bias spectroscopy measurements of these systems were also achieved. In the case of few-donor implanted devices, isolated charge transfers were detected in both MOS and PIN based devices. The signals corresponded to between 0.01 and 0.05 of a single electron charge, induced on the islands of the SETs. The magnetic field dependence of the charge transfers detected in few-donor implanted devices was also investigated, along with basic phosphorous donor ionization experiments. The devices were also measured using SETs operated in rf mode, yielding consistent results.  The work presented in this thesis is a step towards realizing a silicon charge-based quantum computer and other advanced single-electron devices based on phosphorous ion-implantation in silicon.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Silicon</field><field name="subject">Cellular automata</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41340</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of multidrug transporters in childhood malignancies</field><field name="creator">Pajic, Marina, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the foremost causes of treatment failure in childhood malignancies. MDR is a multifactorial process, but classic resistance to cytotoxic drugs has most often been associated with over-expression of one or more MDR transporter proteins in malignant cells, conferring on them the ability to extrude an extraordinarily diverse array of endo- and xenobiotics out of the cell. The best characterized multidrug transporters, P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein (MRP), belong to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) gene superfamily, and have been previously implicated in the development of drug resistance in the clinical context. The work described herein examined the various aspects of the MDR genotype and phenotype in the childhood malignancies acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and neuroblastoma.  The first series of studies tested the hypothesis that morphine, a potential Pgp substrate, might influence the efficacy and/or toxicity of clinically used chemotherapy agents which are substrates for Pgp. The results, however, provided no evidence in a variety of human tumour cell lines of morphine influencing response to selected chemotherapeutic drugs. This finding is particularly important as morphine remains to be the opioid of choice for the treatment of cancer pain in the clinic.  The second series of studies examined the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MDR1 gene, encoding Pgp, and in the MRP1 gene, on patient outcome in childhood ALL or neuroblastoma, with a view to identifying novel prognostic markers for these malignancies. It was found that two of the examined SNPs in the MRP1 gene were associated with improved outcome in neuroblastoma, which had not previously been demonstrated in this disease. Moreover, each of the relevant MRP1 SNPs were associated with lower MRP1 gene expression in both patient samples and tumour cell lines, supporting previous studies indicating that low MRP1 expression in neuroblastoma is strongly associated with improved patient outcome. Importantly, the results of this study suggest a role for selected MRP1 polymorphisms in predicting clinical response in neuroblastoma.  Finally, a series of studies were undertaken, using both in vitro and in vivo model systems, to test the efficacy of putative small molecule inhibitors of the MRP1 gene and its transcriptional regulator, the MYCN oncogene, in neuroblastoma. These studies demonstrated for the first time the efficacy of a novel compound, 4H10, at reversing multidrug resistance either in cultured neuroblastoma cells, or in the MYCN transgenic mice, which develop neuroblastoma that closely mirror the human disease. The results indicate that inhibition of MRP1 function has potential clinical importance in the treatment of neuroblastoma, and therefore warrant further research in this area. In contrast, the results failed to provide evidence of the in vivo efficacy of the novel putative small molecule MYCN inhibitors analysed in these studies. Collectively, the findings of these studies contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of clinical drug resistance, and may help in the development of new approaches for risk assessment and treatment of aggressive childhood malignancies and thereby improve the long-term outlook of children diagnosed with these debilitating diseases.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multidrug resistance.</field><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41374</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Returning Medusa's gaze : Baroque intertext in Alejo Carpentier</field><field name="creator">Wakefield, Steve, School of Modern Languages, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis studies the concept of the baroque as applied to the works of the Cuban novelist Alejo Carpentier (1904-1980). It revisits the original inspiration that the writer found in baroque architecture and sculpture, as expressed in the articles he wrote from Spain in the early 1930s, and follows his use of baroque culture in each of his novels. It is found that, through his attempt to create a period ambience for his historical fictions by incorporating into his novels descriptions of the art and architecture of the Baroque era, and by imitating the literary style of Spanish Golden Age writers, he ultimately produced a parodic and ironic style that was put to a highly original use even in those works set in the contemporary period. Finally, the mature works produced in the last decade of Carpentier's life are studied, and the continuities and discontinuities between these works and those of previous periods are examined, in order to arrive at a critical assessment of the potential to renovate the Latin American novel created by this writer's use of the baroque. Throughout this thesis the primary focus is placed upon the role played by the visual arts, including architecture, in Carpentier's development of baroque themes and style, a secondary focus being placed upon literary influences. Thus the importance for Carpentier of various writers and artists is examined, such as Cervantes, Quevedo, Piranesi, Vico, Goya, Barr????s and d'Ors. It is found that Carpentier's use of baroque themes, motifs and style enabled him to make a unique contribution to literature in a number of ways: by creating an original means of representing the position of the individual with regard to society and the historical process, by reevaluating Latin American culture and environment vis-????-vis is Europe, and by adopting a postcolonial perspective of cultural self-assertiveness that was to pave the way for the 'boom' in the Latin American novel.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carpentier</field><field name="subject">Alejo</field><field name="subject">1904-</field><field name="subject">Carpentier</field><field name="subject">Alejo</field><field name="subject">Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19141</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Generating the communication infrastracture for module-based dynamic reconfiguration of FPGas</field><field name="creator">Koh, Shannon, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Current approaches to supporting module-based FPGA reconfiguration focus on various aspects and sub-problems in the area but do not combine to form a coherent, top-down methodology that factors low-level device parameters into every step of the design flow. This thesis proposes such a top-down methodology from application specification to low-level implementation, centered around examining the problem of generating a point-to-point communications infrastructure to support the changing interfaces of dynamically placed modules. Low-level implementation parameters are considered at every stage to ensure that area, timing and budget constraints of the application are met. The approach advocates the regular layout of modules surrounded by a wiring harness supporting the communications for those modules, and thus provides an advanced understanding of how to implement the "fixed wiring harness" model of reconfigurable computing proposed by Brebner. Results have shown that compared to flattened net lists the regularity of the layout does not impose significant overheads on critical path delays. At high communication densities it can even result in lower delays. The core of the methodology is an infrastructure generation process that allocates modules to slots and merges configuration graphs to form wiring harnesses that support the communications for these merged configurations. This thesis suggests methods and evaluates algorithms for configuration graph merging so as to reduce run-time reconfiguration overheads. Initial experiments with a greedy merging algorithm performed on an optical flow application resulted in a substantial reduction of 64% in reconfiguration time. The effects of graph merging with the initial greedy algorithm and an improved dynamic programming algorithm were explored for a range of device sizes and architectural parameters. Results show that configuration merging using the greedy method results in significant reductions to the reconfiguration delay. The dynamic programming algorithm provides consistent improvements above and beyond the savings provided by the greedy method. In addition, a strong correlation was identified between the quality of front-end design activities such as partitioning and the effectiveness of back-end implementations. The methodology is integrated into the Xilinx commercial tool flow for partial reconfiguration, and is effective for implementing applications for module-based FPGA reconfiguration where the modules and their communications requirements are known at design time. It also allows a system designer to consider alternate device sizes and parameters until a set is found that satisfies the application constraints.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Field programmable gate arrays.</field><field name="subject">Programmable array logic.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of lipid rafts in actin-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages</field><field name="creator">Magenau, Astrid Irmela, Centre for Vascular Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to investigate the role of lipid rafts in actin-mediated phagocytosis. Lipid rafts are defined as highly condensed membrane domains enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids and are thought to participate in a range of cellular functions including actin-mediated phagocytosis. Remodelling of the actin skeleton facilitates the formation of a phagocytic membrane cup and drives the uptake of particles. Hence, actin restructuring is essential for phagocytosis. How engagement of Fc receptors triggers membrane re-organization at the site of phagocytosis and how the formation of ordered raft domains is linked to actin remodelling during phagosome maturation is currently not known. Lipid rafts potentially form platforms for local signal transduction for Fc surface receptors and secondary messengers. Raft distribution therefore would critically influence and direct their function. The hypothesis is that lipid rafts are the membrane sites on the cell surface, which enable, drive and localise actin- dependent phagocytosis. Phagocytosis in macrophages was induced with IgG-coated beads of different sizes as substrates for uptake via the Fc&#61543; receptor mediated pathway. Membrane order was visualised and quantified by two-photon microscopy. Actin remodelling was imaged in parallel with confocal microscopy. Time-course and live cell imaging demonstrated that phagocytosis induces formation of highly ordered membrane domains around the phagocytic particle independently of the particle size. The high membrane order is the biophysical hallmark of lipid rafts suggested that Fc receptor cross-linking induces the coalescence of lipid rafts. Live-cell imaging further identified a temporal correlation between membrane condensation and actin restructuring at sites of phagocytosis. Membrane condensation persisted after actin detached from the sealed phagosome. Receptor clustering induced by particle binding activates Src kinases leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAM motif of the receptors, activation of GTPases and actin polymerisation. Lipid raft recruitment may be driven by these events or alternatively, rafts be essential for kinase activation. Several inhibitors were used to interrupt crucial steps in the signalling cascade leading to actin restructuring. Laurdan microscopy showed that membrane order is independent of Lyn activation (inhibited with PP2), PI3K activity (inhibited with Wortmannin) and actin polymerisation (Latrunculin B). Inhibitors had differential effects on phagocytosis rates of small and large particles. Inhibition of Lyn had a more severe effect on phagocytosis of large beads than on phagocytosis of small beads. Disruption of PI3K activity with Wortmannin only inhibited phagocytosis of large but not of small particles, whereas disruption of the actin skeleton with Latrunculin B inhibited phagocytosis of small and large particles. These data suggest that membrane condensation is independent of kinase activity and occurs upstream of actin remodelling. The role of lipid rafts in phagocytosis was further investigated by modulation of sterol composition of the cell membranes. Cholesterol depletion with methyl-&#61538;- cyclodextrin disrupted membrane organization at phagosomes of small and large beads and also abolished phagocytosis. However, the fluidity of the entire plasma membrane was increased upon treatment of cells with methyl-&#61538;-cyclodextrin suggesting that this condition was not specifically affecting phagosomal membranes. Cholesterol enrichment increased membrane condensation even further than the membrane condensation detected in control phagosomes.  Incorporation of 7-keto-cholesterol (7KC) decreased membrane order of phagosomes of small beads but not of large beads. 7KC can prevent membrane condensation due to its additional keto-group, which acts as a spacer between phospholipids. Phagocytosis of large beads but not of small beads was affected by 7KC incorporation. This suggests that 7KC only moderately reduces membrane order, which diminishes but not completely abolishes phagocytosis. This might be explained by the fact that 7KC enrichment and m&#61538;CD treatment diminished actin remodelling and reduced the complexity of the F-actin network. Mass spectrometry was employed to quantify the lipidome of phagosomal membranes. This is the first study that directly demonstrates that phagosomes exhibit a distinct lipid composition and were enriched in sphingomyelin (SM) but depleted of cholesterol. Furthermore, the effects of sterol modulation on lipid species abundance were investigated. Cholesterol and 7KC enrichment resulted in lower levels of PC, but higher levels of charged lipids. In addition, 7KC treatment increased SM levels. In conclusion, cross-linking of Fc receptors triggers the formation of ordered membrane domains that do not have the classical raft composition. They are cholesterol depleted but rich in sphingomyelin. The formation of these ??rafts?? occurs upstream of actin remodelling and is necessary for actin remodelling during phagocytosis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Lipid rafts</field><field name="subject">Phagocytosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43699</field></doc><doc><field name="title">?? la d??rive</field><field name="creator">Pluta, Izabela, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The title of this paper refers to a sense of being in drift. The French term ?? la d??rive seemed appropriate to adopt because the work was conceived and made in France, and the meaning of it umbrellas the ideas I have attempted to explore in my MFA. ?? la d??rive is comprised of two parts. Firstly, the paper presents an investigation of several ideas and concerns revolving around the broad notion of the concept 'place'. In this paper, the concept of 'place' addresses a physical definition of belonging that exists within a specific cultural framework. I discuss Marc Aug??'s theory of place in relation to Nikos Papastergiadis' idea of the absence of it through diaspora. Importantly the relevance of these ideas to my creative interests stem from my personal history and dual nationality (Polish-Australian) as well as the notion of absence and presence in the concept 'place'. Secondly, the paper then discusses these theories in relation to the various works I have produced over the past two and a half years, including photographs, photo mural installations, collected objects, prints and drawings. Here I refer directly to artists including Tacita Dean, Simryn Gill, Peter Bialobrzeski and Vittorio De Sica's Ladri di biciclette. These artists inspire and provoke me to consider why I make work, what influences have defined my practice and why I respond to particular places. It has been important to identify these interests in order to learn from what has always been an intuitive art making process. I am drawn to how each artist considers aspects of place, time, history, nostalgia and temporality.

Research was conducted in two main thrusts: (1) investigation into the governing kinetic processes behind star polymer synthesis via what has become known as a reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), R-group approach and (2) an entirely new mode of living free radical (LFR) polymerisation which has been named thioketone mediated polymerisation (TKMP).  In the first broad area of the described research, a novel kinetic modelling scheme has been developed in which only the reactions of a single arm star are simulated explicitly. Subsequently, the molecular weight distributions (MWDs) arising from the single arm star simulation are convolved, using probabilistic calculations, to generate the MWD appropriate to a multi-arm star polymerisat ion bearing t he same kinetic parameters as the single arm one. This model is validated against experimental data, enabling, for the first time, the use of rigorous theoretical reasoning to distill a set of synthetic guidelines for star polymer synthesis via a RAFT, R-group approach.  Subsequently, the product spectra resulting from RAFT, R-group approach polymerisations of para-acetoxystyrene have been analysed via mass spectrometry. This has led to direct evidence for many of the complex species whose existence had, up until this point, been inferred from gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measured MWDs. The menagerie of species identified includes, but is not limited to, star-star couples, initiator fragment terminated stars, initiator fragment terminated star-star couples and linear chains -- both living and terminated. Using a kinetic model devised specifically for application in mass spectrometry analysis, the experimentally observed abundances of each of the above species have been compared to t hose predicted by simulation. The qualitative agreement between the predicted and observed abundances has provided additional evidence that t he proposed mechanism for RAFT, R-group approach polymerisations is correct and operative. Further, it seems unlikely that significant, undiscovered kinetic phenomena exist.  Due to (a) long simulation times encountered using the state of the art, commercial partial differential equation solver for polymerisation kinetics (i.e. PREDICI, Computing in Technology (CiT), GmbH; see http://www.cit-wulkow.de) and (b) the limited flexibility  this software provides with respect to the types of chemical species that can be simulated, fundamental research has been conducted into the kinetic Monte Carlo method to (i) examine fundamental aspects of this simulation approach; (ii) determine the maximum speed attainable through a combination of optimisations including run-time generation of problem specific code and parallelisation; and, therefore (iii) find out what the potential of this method may be as a replacement for t he existing methods. In terms of speed, the developed code outperforms previous Monte Carlo benchmarks in the literature by a factor of 2.6 and the latest developments in the commercial tool, PREDICI that took place during the author's Ph.D. candidature give it similar performance to the herein described Monte Carlo code; however, the latter is required to run on multiple processors in order to compete with the serial algorithm implemented in PREDICI. The Monte Carlo method does, however, provide complete freedom with respect to the chemical species whose kinetics can be simulated, allowing for complex species with many chain lengths and, in principal copolymer compositions and branched structures. The Monte Carlo approach is the method of choice for these types of simulations and for the first time competes with the commercial tool in terms of speed. In the second broad area of the described research, an experimental investigation has been conducted into the applicability of thioketones, S=C (R1) (R2), as mediating agents for free radical polymerisations. The compound di-tert-butyl thioketone (DTBT), S=C-(C(CH3)3)2, has been chosen as a model reagent and this, when incorporated into a free radical polymerisation of styrene has led to a linear increase of the average molecular weight as conversion of monomer into polymer takes place - demonstrating control.  A reversible radical trapping mechanism has been proposed and evidence for this has been provided in the form of an ab initio calculation of the equilibrium constant for the trapping of a styryl dimer radical by DTBT. This equilibrium constant was approximately K = 105 L mol-1 and is close to the value which is expected on the basis of the experimental results.  To aid future experimental investigations intoTKMP, a quantum chemical survey has, been conducted with the aim of discovering the radical affinities of a large range of thioketones. It has been demonstrated that there is ample scope within this class of compound for potent radical trapping - far above that of DTBT. The affinities of various thioketone substrates for radicals have been understood in terms of the radical stabilising and thioketone destabilising effect of the two substituents R1 and R2 on,  respectively, the adduct radical,  R-S-C???(R1) (R2), and the parent thioketone.  All results appearing in this thesis have been published previously in peer-reviewed scientific journals.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymerization.</field><field name="subject">Chemical kinetics -- Mathematical models.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Unexplored aspects of socio-pragmatics in Korean refusals</field><field name="creator">Lee, Bo Hyun, Languages &amp; Linguistics, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores socio-pragmatic aspects of refusals in Korean.  Past researches asserted that 1) Korean speakers seldom use direct refusal formulas (e.g., Byon 2003; Lyuh 1994; Sohn 1986) and 2) Korean speakers frequently employ statement of regret/apology when refusing (e.g., Byon 2003; Kwon 2004; Lyuh 1994). Upon analysing 133 refusals drawn from Korean drama data, four generalisations are formulated, two of which are in direct conflict with the findings of past studies. The four generalisations have been further substantiated through survey process of 118 native Korean speakers in Seoul, Korea.  Through the use of drama data and reinforcement via surveys, this study proposed that 1) direct refusals (e.g., direct no, negatives willingness/ability) are a common attribute of Korean refusals (showing 23.8% of total semantic formulas in the drama data), to a much greater extent than previously thought. 2) Statement of regret/apology is not a common strategy employed by native Korean speakers (1.9% of total semantic formulas in the drama data) unless a large power and/or distance variable is involved. 3) Positive opinion/feeling (e.g., "I would love to but. .. ") is also not frequently employed by native Korean speakers. 4) Frequent uses of criticism of the request/requester etc. (15.3%) identified in the data were mostly in argumentative contexts and through the results of the survey, we argue that some offrecord strategies are equally strong or stronger than bald-on-record strategies.  This study introduces the use of drama as a valuable source of near-natural speech data. To date, the use of drama data in analysing speech acts have been very limited. By analysing drama data, new aspects of Korean refusals have been uncovered. In particular, this study has been found that many of the refusals involve more the augmentation of face threat than its minimisation, unless there is a large power difference and/or a distance to maintain. This is seemingly in contrast to what is assumed in the politeness theory formulated by Brown and Levinson (1987).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Speech acts (Linguistics)</field><field name="subject">Korean drama.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41432</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A model for the (QUASI) steady flame spread on vertical and horizontal surface</field><field name="creator">Shi, Yan, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Initial fire spread is composed of the processes of ignition, flame spread, and burning rate. The effects of a material's thermal characteristics and burning behaviors on flame spread are important. However, many zone and field models of compartment fire can not predict spread on objects accurately enough due to the neglect of these behaviors in their fire growth sub-models. As a result, a model dedicated to the early stage of fire growth is needed to provide the accuracy necessary for competent assessment of the response of safety systems, as well as satisfying the requirement for a comprehensive risk assessment.  This study is undertaken to investigate the use of formulations outlined by previous researchers by review of the theory of flame spread models. A computer model is proposed that can determine the impact of the material properties with emphasis on practical engineering analyses. Through this computer program, we can obtain the pyrolysis zone, the flame height, the burnout time, the burnout portion, the mass loss rate, total heat release rate, and mean flame velocity of a material at specific time.  The effort in this study has been focused on developing a relatively simple model for fire spread on a vertically oriented material which contains the most common aspect of fire growth theory such as the transit burning rate, material properties, burner affection, flame spread rate and burnout. This study used Vc++ as a program development platform which has an easy to use interface and reasonable execution times.  The model is a combination of two sub-models. One is to simulate the flame spread on horizontal surface. The other is to simulate it on a vertical surface. In two sub-models, the spread process model is two-dimensioned yet symmetric. By using empirical physical equations and correlations, this model predicted flame spread by solving a set of closed coupled correlations simultaneously.  Each sub-model contains several functions: ignition, mass loss rate calculation, burning area and the surface temperature calculation. The results of this proposed computer model are compared with experimental studies involving a limited number of comparisons of experimental data for early stage vertical flame spread. The model calculations and experimental measurements of the mass loss rate, heat release rate, and radiation flux were found to be in good agreement. Recommendations are made for further development of the more complex initial stage fire growth model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fire growth.</field><field name="subject">Flame spread.</field><field name="subject">Ignition.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hydrogel determined metal bioaccessibility in acid sulfate-affected landscapes</field><field name="creator">Reynolds, Jason Kurt, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Exposure of sulfidic sediments to atmospheric conditions can under various environmental and anthropogenic influences. The oxidation of sulfides results in the production of acidity, dissolution of aluminosilicates and pedogenci development. This process has acid sulfate landscapes throughout the world identified as major emitters of elevated concentrations of chemical metals. This emission of acidity and metals alters the bioaccessibility and subsequently has a deleterious impact on the surrounding biologic environment. Despite this, the examination of the biologic impact in these landscapes has received only minimal attention. Passive and dynamic hydrogel techniques were used to measure the bioaccessibility of metals in sediments and waters. The technique involved the construction of a restricted pore-size thin-film hydrogel that allowed for the diffusion of the  bioaccessible fraction, composed of the free-ion and easily dissociable metal-complexes. The dynamic hydrogel technique contained a resin sink, which allowed for a time-integrated flux concentration to be calculated. The dynamic hydrogel technique was trialled and found to correlate with the pygmy mussel (Xenostrobus securis) aluminium uptake for short exposure periods (24 hours).The dynamic hydrogel metal concentration was also found to correlate to indpendantly measured pore water and simultaneously extracted metal (SEM) concentrations.  The hydrogel techniqe was further applied to investigate the sediment-water interface in drained and non-drained acid suflate landscapes. The studied Australian and Finnish acid sulfate landscapes showed contrasting relationships between the acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and SEM fractions. In the Australian sediments, a conversion of AVS-S to FeS2-S occurs with depth driven by a polysulfide pathway, whilst the Finnish sediments displayed a persistence of AVS-S with depth with limited conversion to FeS2-S. Distinct variations exist at the sediment-water interface of the two contrasting landscapes, with AVS-S to FeS2-S ratios of 2.5 for the Australian and 0.2 in the Finnish sediments. The sediment geochemistry regulated metal mobility. A two-dimensional passive and dynamic hydrogel approach illustrated microniches and supply zones of aluminium iron, manganese and zinc at varying depths near the sediment-water interface. The measurement of bioaccessibility using an in situ technique in acid sulfate landscapes is a first for both Australia and Finland, and this research provides an important avenue for future water and sediment quality monitoring.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acid sulphate soils.</field><field name="subject">Colloids.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic factors of cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses that influence outcomes of antiviral therapy in transplantation</field><field name="creator">Iwasenko, Jenna Maree, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The clinical impact of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) and progression to CMV disease in immunocompromised patients has been reduced by therapeutic strategies using ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet and cidofovir. However, extensive antiviral therapy increases the risk of antiviral resistance due to mutations in the UL97 protein kinase and UL54 DNA polymerase. Co-infection with HHV-6 or HHV-7 is also associated with increased CMV reactivation and disease. Genotypic CMV antiviral resistance was identified in 38% of Australian immunocompromised patients. While UL97 mutations only were identified in 23% of patients, additional UL54 mutations, with the potential to confer multidrug resistance, were detected in 15% of patients. Antiviral resistant CMV strains were found to emerge rapidly in highly immunocompromised patients, and some strains were able to persist in the absence of selective pressure. Three new mutations were identified (UL97 - N597D, UL54 - F412S, D485N). N597D was characterised by recombinant phenotyping and conferred minimal ganciclovir resistance. Neither baculovirus nor coupled transcription/translation yielded full-length UL54 protein (pUL54; ~140 kDa) for activity assays. However, truncated pUL54 (~66 kDa) was purified after prokaryotic expression. HHV-6 and HHV-7 co-infection was a common clinical occurrence; with 36% of liver transplant recipients infected with HHV-6 (11% persistent) and 80% with HHV-7 (52% persistent). ValGCV therapy did not significantly alter the incidence of HHV-6, HHV-7 or co-infection. The most prevalent co-infection pattern was CMV, HHV-6 and HHV-7 (46%) and both CMV and HHV-7 (38%). CMV reactivation was predominantly independent of HHV-6/HHV-7, although 27% of patients had initial HHV-7 reactivation. Despite frequent co-infection, HHV-6 and HHV-7 were not associated with clinical disease, with possible exception of HHV-7 and acute cellular rejection. CMV antiviral resistance remains a significant issue in transplantation, emphasising the importance of antiviral resistance testing in an era of widespread prophylaxis. New mutations in UL97 and UL54 continue to be identified. Further characterisation of UL54 mutations using polymerase activity assays would increase our knowledge of enzymological basis of antiviral resistance. Co-infection with HHV-6 and HHV-7 is common in transplant recipients, but does not play a significant role in disease. Similar co-infection rates between valGCV-treated and untreated patients indicate that valGCV is not highly effective against HHV-6 and HHV-7.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transplantation</field><field name="subject">cytomegalovirus</field><field name="subject">antiviral resistance</field><field name="subject">herpesvirus</field><field name="subject">coinfection</field><field name="subject">UL54 DNA polymerase</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43703</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the translational regulator p97 in mammalian cells</field><field name="creator">Nousch, Marco, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Members of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) family play a central role in the translation initiation process. One member of this family is p97 (also called DAP5 and NAT1), a protein that is highly homologous to the C-terminal two thirds of eIF4G. Overexpression studies suggested that p97 is a pure translational repressor that has to be cleaved into a shorter form called p86, in order to show translational activity. In this study a series of experiments indicated that full length p97 has a number elF property such as association with active translating ribosomes, stimulatory effects in the Direct Initiation Factor assay and accumulation in stress granules. Additionally the endogenous p97 complex was isolated from HeLa cells and mRNA as well as the protein components were characterized. P97 associated mRNAs were described by a custom made 5'UTR focus array, showing that the protein binds to a broad range of mRNA. The relative lack of mRNA specificity argues for a general role of p97 in translation, which does not seems to be essential in unchallenged cells, because a down regulation of p97 protein levels has no effect on the translational status of the bulk of mRNAs. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed a novel protein-protein interaction between p97 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), which does not rely on a nucleic acid. For this interaction the C- and N-terminus of p97 play a critical role. Further, Dnmt1 has the ability to interact with elF4G and the small ribosomal subunit, which might provide evidence for a novel function of Dnmt1 in RNA metabolism.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mammals -- Cytology.</field><field name="subject">Mammals -- Cytogenetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A parameter optimisation tool for excitable cell mathematical models based on CellML</field><field name="creator">Hui, Ben Bunny Chun Bun, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mathematical models are often used to describe and, in some cases predict, excitable cellular behaviour that is based on observed experimental results. With the increase of computational power, it is now possible to solve such models in a relatively short time. This, along with an increasing knowledge of cellular and subcellular processes, has led to the development of a large number of complex cellular models, capable of describing a broad range of excitable cell behaviour. But the use of complex models can also lead to problems. Most models can accurately reproduce results associated with the data on which the models are based. However, results from complicated models, with large numbers of variables and parameters, are less reliable if the model is not placed under the same physiological conditions as defined by the model author. In order to test a model??s suitability and robustness over a range of physiological conditions, one needs to fit model parameters against experimental data observed under those conditions. By using the modelling standard and repository offered by CellML, model users can easily select and adapt a large number of models to set up their own applications to fit model parameters against user-supplied experimental data. However, currently there is a lack of software that can utilise CellML model for parameter fitting. In this thesis, a Java-based utility has been developed, capable of performing least square parameter optimisation for a wide range of CellML models. Using the developed software, a number of parameter fits and identifiability analyses were performed on a selected group of CellML models. It was found that most of the models were ill-formed, with larger numbers of parameters worsening model identifiability. In some cases, the usage of multiple datasets and different objective functions can improve model identifiability. Finally, the developed software was used to perform parameter optimisation against two sets of action potentials from a sinoatrial node experiment, in the absence and presence of E9031, a specific ion channel blocker.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">CellML</field><field name="subject">Parameter optimisation</field><field name="subject">Ionic model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41447</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrolyte and membrane studies of the novel vanadium bromide redox flow cell</field><field name="creator">Prifti, Helen, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The novel Vanadium Bromide (V/Br) redox flow cell employs a V (III)/V (II) couple in the negative half-cell and a Br/Br2 couple in the positive half-cell, with hydrobromic acid and hydrochloric acid as the supporting electrolyte. This study evaluated the chemical and electrochemical properties of the electrolytes and assessed experimental and commercial membranes for use in the V/Br flow cell.  A number of techniques were employed to characterise the composition of the V/Br flow cell electrolytes. During charge, the conductivity of the positive half-cell electrolyte increased, whilst the density and viscosity increased. The reverse was observed for the negative half-cell. The UV-visible spectra of the electrolytes showed characteristic peak wavelengths of the vanadium oxidation states and provided and insight into the halogenated species forming during the operation of the V/Br flow cell. The electrochemical properties of the electrolytes were also examined using cyclic voltammetry. NMR studies examined the relationships between the 35CI and 79Br nuclei in the presence of halide and paramagnetic vanadium ions. It was established that the SOC and performance of the V/Br flow cell can be measured by changes in slllectral chemical shifts and line widths.  Small-scale cycling experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of ion exchange membranes in the V/Br redox flow cell. Of the membranes evaluated, a number were not suitable for use due to high membrane resistances or low chemical stability. The perfluorinated Nafion?? and Gore Select?? ion exchange membranes proved to be the most chemically inert and showed low resistances. The Gore Select?? membranes did however exhibit blistering during extended cycling. The chemical stability and cycling performance of the HiporeTM microporous separator showed promise for future studies to optimise the selectivity and ion exchange capacity of the membrane.  Tests of membrane ion exchange capacity, diffusivity and conductivity mirrored the properties displayed in the cell cycling experiments. Results suggested that the structural characteristics of the membrane (including functionality and crosslinking) greatly influenced membrane properties and performance. Tests of long term stability showed a negative change in membrane properties. These changes did not however reflect measured changes during cell cycling experiments.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bromides.</field><field name="subject">Electrolytes.</field><field name="subject">Vanadium.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Culture, motivation, and vocational decision-making of senior high school students</field><field name="creator">Jung, Jae Yup, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this investigation was to examine the cultural and motivational perspectives associated with the occupational or vocational decision-related processes of senior high school students. Two theoretical frameworks were developed to guide the investigation by integrating theories from the culture, motivation, decision-making, and vocational decision-making literatures. One theoretical framework investigated the roles of culture and motivation in the vocational decisions made by senior high school students, while the other examined the vocational decision-related processes of senior high school students in terms of the extent to which they may be amotivated about choosing a future occupation. A mixed methods approach (incorporating a cross-sectional and correlational research design for the quantitative component) was implemented using a specially developed questionnaire. In the first phase of the investigation, the questionnaire was administered to 492 Year 11 students attending a stratified random sample of six Independent high schools located in the Sydney metropolitan area. In the second and main phase, a refined version of the questionnaire was administered to 566 Year 11 students attending a stratified random sample of 16 government high schools located in the Sydney metropolitan area. Structural equation modelling, discriminant analyses, and qualitative techniques were used to analyse the data collected in the two phases. The major findings of the investigation included the development and confirmation (after modifications) of two new theoretically-justifiable models of vocational decision-related processes. One model provided empirical support for relationships between cultural orientation, values, and attitudes/intentions toward occupations, while the other identified relationships between amotivation, indecision toward occupations, expectancy-value variables, and influences from the family. Multiple themes that were identified in the qualitative data analyses supplemented and partially supported elements of the two empirical models, and enabled a richer understanding of the issues surrounding the vocational decision. The findings of the investigation may be used by career advisors, psychologists, educators, and families to advise and assist senior high school students faced with the vocational decision. The investigation may contribute to reducing the gap in the literature on the roles of culture and motivation in the vocational decision-related processes of senior high school students.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vocational decision-making</field><field name="subject">Culture</field><field name="subject">Motivation</field><field name="subject">Vocational indecision</field><field name="subject">High school students</field><field name="subject">Structural equation modeling</field><field name="subject">Discriminant analysis</field><field name="subject">Qualitative data analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards a versatile transport protocol</field><field name="creator">Jourjon, Guillaume, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents three main contributions that aim to improve the transport layer of the current networking architecture. The transport layer is nowadays dominated by the use of TCP and its congestion control. Recently new congestion control mechanisms have been proposed. Among them, TCP Friendly Hate Control (TFRC) appears to be one of the most complete. Nevertheless this congestion control mechanism, as with TCP, does not take into account either the evolution of the network in terms of Quality of Service and mobility or the evolution of the applications.  The first contribution of this thesis is a specialisation of TFRC congestion control to provide a QoS-aware Transport Protocol specifically designed to operate over QoS-enabled networks with bandwidth guarantee mechanisms. This protocol combines a QoS-aware congestion control, which takes into account network-level bandwidth reservations, with full ordered reliability mechanism to provide a transport service similar to TCP. As a result, we obtain the guaranteed throughput at the application level where TCP fails. This protocol is t he first transport protocol compliant with bandwidth guaranteed networks.  At the same time the set of network services expands, new technologies have been proposed and deployed at the physical layer. These new technologies are mainly characterised by communications done without wire constraint and the mobility of the end-systems. Furthermore, these technologies are usually deployed on entities where the CPU power and memory storage are limited. The second contribution of this thesis is therefore to propose an adaptation of TFHC to these entities. This is accomplished with the proposition of a new sender-based version of TFHC. This version has been implemented, evaluated and its numerous contributions and advantages compare to usual TFHC version have been demonstrated.  Finally, we proposed an optimisation of actual implementations of TFHC. This optimisation first consists in the proposition of an algorithm based on a numerical analysis of the equation used in TFHC and the use of the Newton's algorithm.  We furthermore give a first step, with the introduction of a new framework for TFRC, in order to better understand TFHC behaviour and to optimise the computation of the packet loss rate according to loss probability distributions.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transport protocol.</field><field name="subject">TCP/IP (Computer network protocol)</field><field name="subject">Computer network protocols.</field><field name="subject">Congestion control.</field><field name="subject">Quality of service.</field><field name="subject">Light architecture.</field><field name="subject">Algorithmic optimisation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41480</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Internal symmetry networks for image processing</field><field name="creator">Li, Guanzhong, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Internal Symmetry Networks are a recently developed class of Cellular Neural Network inspired by the phenomenon of internal symmetry in quantum physics.

Australia has 25% of world's natural gas resources hence Australia's crude oil dependency can be reduced extensively by developing catalysts that will facilitate the technique of converting natural gas to synthetic fuel.  Molybdenum nitride has been employed in this study for FTS because of its superior mechanical strength, stability, exceptional resistance to carbon deposition &amp; suifur poisoning. In particular, molybdenum nitride is endowed with similar electronic properties to those of noble metals. Other transition metal nitrides such as Co nitride and Co-Mo nitride were also investigated in this study. The physicochemical attributes of nitride catalysts were examined by BET surface area, particle dispersion, acid site strength &amp; concentration, and surface elemental composition. Gas to solid nitridation kinetic was thermogravimetrically monitored. CO hydrogenation activity was measured in a fixed bed reactor using various syngas compositions and temperatures at atmospheric pressure. The effect of nitridation conditions on catalytic properties of nitrides was investigated via 23 factorial design. It has revealed that nitridation parameters; temperature, nitriding gas composition (H2:NH3) and nitridation reaction time were all significantly influencing catalyst properties. The optimal nitridation condition was 973 K, H2:NH3=1: 1, and 4 hours of nitriding time which gave higher alkene selectivity. 20 wt% M02N/Ah03 was found to be the better FT catalyst compare to catalysts with lower Mo loading and other inorganic oxide supports. Nitridation kinetic studied by thermogravimetric analysis showed that successful nitridation of transition metal oxide precursor was dependent of nitridation temperature and hydrogen concentration. Co-Mo nitride has several forms of nitride species, COS.47N, C03M03N, MoN, and Mo2N. It was shown that COS.47N was the most active component favouring the CO hydrogenation rate and alkene selectivity.

Characterisation of the 43 kb cylindrospennopsin biosynthesis gene cluster (cyr), in Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii AWT205 is described. Biosynthesis is initiated via an amidinotransfer onto glycine followed by five polyketide extensions. Rings are formed via Michael additions, while the uracil ring is formed by a novel mechanism. Tailoring reactions, including sulfation and hydroxylation complete the biosynthesis. We describe the characterisation of PST biosynthesis gene clusters in Anabaena circinalis,  Aphanizomenon sp. and Lyngbya wollei. These gene clusters span between 28 and 36 kb and contain genes coding for the biosynthesis and export of PSTs. The Lyngbya wollei PST gene cluster represents a 'natural combinatorial biosynthesis' event, explaining its unique toxin profile. A biosynthetic pathway leading to the formation of saxitoxin and its analogues in these organisms is proposed, and a putative insertion/excision site of the PST gene cluster in Anabaena circinalis 310F was identified. Interestingly, PSTs are produced by distantly related organisms via this unique biosynthesis pathway. We Investigated the phylogenetics of PST biosynthesis genes from four different genera of cyanobacteria. The results suggested that PST biosynthesis in cyanobacteria is an ancient trait, whereby the sporadic distribution of PST production in extant isolates of Anabaena circinalis and Aphanizomenon sp. is a result of the repeated loss of the biosynthetic gene cluster. Horizontal gene ransfer also appears to have had a critical influence on PST biosynthesis in Lyngbya wollei. We additionally propose a hypothetical, mixed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)/polyketide synthase (PKS) biosynthesis scheme for anatoxin-a. Degenerate PCR primers were developed, for the specific amplification of mixed NRPSIPKS hybrid ketosynthase (KS) domains. Gene-walking distally to a novel hybrid KS domain in the anatoxin-a producer Planktothrix rubescens, revealed an orphan gene cluster, denoted pro, which spans 24 kb and codes for a mixed NRPS/PKS system, putatively producing an acetylated and sulphated dipeptide.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria.</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis.</field><field name="subject">Alkaloids.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Primary hepatitis C virus infection in prisons</field><field name="creator">Post, Jeffrey John, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes significant morbidity and mortality. An understanding of the factors associated with both acquisition and clearance of HCV infection is critical to prevention strategies including vaccine development. Although research in the prison environment is logistically challenging, inmates are a premier risk group. Accordingly, a prospective cohort study of prisoners with monthly sampling for HCV viraemia was undertaken to assess the incidence of, and risk factors for, infection; and to assess the natural history of infection when detected by viraemia. The incidence of infection was 8 per 100 person years, with the incidence of "high risk" and "possible" HCV transmission risk events being 61 and 210 per 100 person years respectively. The first case of HCV infection in prison with tattooing as the probable route of acquisition was reported. A novel phenotype of HCV infection with HCV viraemia and subsequent clearance without the development of symptoms, biochemical hepatitis or seroconversion on HCV specific enzyme immunoassay (EIA), despite more than one year of follow-up, was reported. HCV-specific cell mediated immune responses were detected in the subjects analysed. These subjects also had indeterminate HCV serological responses directed against non-structural proteins detected on a recombinant immunob10t assay (RIBA) that were stable over time and typically predated HCV viraemia. The prevalence of such responses ranged from 29-79% in other relevant cohorts, including injecting drug users (IDUs) and multiply-transfused patients with thalassaemia. The antibody response against the non-structural protein, NS5 was the most reproducible. This reactivity was blocked in 57% of subjects when sera were pre-incubated with recombinant HCV proteins, suggesting HCV-specificity. A case-control study was undertaken to examine whether such responses predicted protection from "classical" HCV infection with EIA seroconversion. Cases that developed HCV viraemia and EIA seroconversion were more likely to have these responses at baseline (when aviraemic) than controls, demonstrating that they do not protect against acute infection. However, the rate of viral clearance in subjects with indeterminate RIBA responses that subsequently developed acute infection and were followed for viral clearance was high (88%), suggesting that such subjects have immune responses that are associated with viral clearance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prisons.</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C virus.</field><field name="subject">Infection.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein kinase A and related pathways in the regulation of apolipoprotein E secretion and catalase activity</field><field name="creator">Guo, Dongni Lily, Centre for Vascular Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) regulates traffic of multiple proteins at different stages along the constitutive secretory pathway. PKA effects are regulated by protein phosphatases, which reverse the actions of PKA by dephosphorylation of PKA-substrates. Localization of specific PKA effects is mediated by the binding of A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is an important regulator of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, and represents a large proportion of total protein constitutively secreted from macrophages. The signalling and trafficking pathways regulating secretion of apoE are unknown. Catalase is a peroxisomal enzyme which contributes to defence against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The primary hypothesis of this thesis is PKA and related protein phosphatase pathways are involved in the regulation of apoE secretion. The secondary hypothesis is that these pathways also regulate cellular clearance of H2O2. In Chapter Three, I have investigated the role of PKA in apoE secretion from primary human macrophages. Structurally distinct inhibitors of PKA (H89, KT5720, inhibitory peptide PKI14-22) all decreased basal secretion of apoE by between 50-80% whereas apoE mRNA or cellular protein are unaffected. Disruption of PKA-AKAP anchoring also significantly inhibited apoE secretion from human macrophages. Secretion of apoE was not immediately stimulated by PKA activity, suggesting that although PKA activity may be permissive for apoE secretion, it is in itself insufficient to stimulate apoE secretion above basal levels. Data from confocal microscopy and live cell imaging revealed PKA inhibition paralysed apoE vesicular movement from and to the plasma membrane. In Chapter Four, I investigated the effects of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) inhibition on apoE secretion by cyclosporin A (CsA). This was found to dose- and time-dependently inhibit secretion of apoE from primary human macrophages and increased cellular accumulation of apoE without affecting apoE mRNA levels. The role of PP2B in regulating apoE secretion was confirmed by using additional peptide and chemical inhibitors of PP2B. This effect was independent of the known inhibition of ABCA1 by CsA. Live cell imaging and confocal microscopy all demonstrated that inhibition of PP2B did not affect the apparent cellular distribution of apoE. Biochemical and microscopy studies indicated distinct mechanisms for PKA and PP2B regulation of apoE secretion. Chapter Five identified PKA-anchoring AKAPs in human macrophages, and investigated AKAP220 expression and its role in PKA-dependent processes relevant to atherosclerosis. AKAP220 protein was absent in human monocytes but was detectable after their differentiation into macrophages, with stable expression during late stages of maturation. It was also present in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO) cells. AKAP220 silencing had no effects on lipoprotein cholesteryl ester accumulation, total cellular apoE levels, apoE secretion or cholesterol efflux from human macrophages. Confocal microscopy in CHO cells revealed peroxisomal localisation of AKAP220. Catalase activity was confirmed to be PKA-regulated process, and AKAP220 was found to be a negative regulator of catalase activity, such that cell lysate catalase activity increased during AKAP220 silencing. AKAP220 silencing also decreased basal secretion of H2O2, detected using a sensitive and specific Amplex?? Red assay kit from intact CHO monolayers.   In conclusion, this thesis has provided evidence that apoE secretion occurs via PKA- and PP2B-dependent pathways in human macrophages, and has identified the A-kinase anchoring protein AKAP220 as a regulator of cellular H2O2 clearance. These results will provide a basis for future investigations into the roles of PKA-related pathways in apoE secretion and catalase activity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B)</field><field name="subject">Apolipoprotein E (apoE)</field><field name="subject">Protein kinase A (PKA)</field><field name="subject">A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAP)</field><field name="subject">Catalase activity</field><field name="subject">Macrophages</field><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A bioinformatics approach to discovery of estrogen-responsive genetic pathways in breast cancer</field><field name="creator">Alles, Marie Chehani, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Breast cancers fall into two major classes depending on their estrogen receptor (ER) status. ER+ and ER- tumors have very different molecular phenotypes, and may have distinct cells of origin. ER- tumors generally fail to respond to endocrine therapy and have a poorer prognosis. To develop a comprehensive understanding of the gene networks active in ER+ compared to ER- breast cancers, we performed a meta-analysis of Grade 3 breast cancers from five published datasets. A measure of association with ER status taking into account intra- and inter-study variability was calculated for every probe set.  The meta-analysis revealed that ER-/Grade 3 tumors show increased expression of proliferation-associated functional categories when compared to ER+/Grade 3 tumors. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis we show that transcript levels of direct transcriptional targets of ER are lower in ER- tumors, but that expression of other estrogen-induced genes is higher in ER- tumors. Transcript levels of both direct and other targets of the estrogen-regulated MYC gene and the E2F family of genes are significantly higher in ER- tumors. The increased expression of targets of MYC and E2F is particularly pronounced in the "basal" subgroup of ER- tumors. This suggests that a study assessing the association of these genes with clinical outcome in ER- patients is warranted, but is not currently feasible due to lack of suitable publicly available data. The contribution of genes regulated or bound by estrogen, MYC or E2F to increased risk of relapse in ER+ tamoxifen-treated patients was assessed in a pilot study using Cox proportional hazards models and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The high expression of several gene sets containing genes induced by estrogen and/or MYC and direct targets of MYC and E2F was correlated with poor outcome in these patients.  We conclude that over-expression or constitutive activation of MYC, possibly in conjunction with elevated E2F activity, may lead to the induction of a set of genes characteristic of the estrogen response thereby contributing to increased proliferation in ER- breast tumors, particularly in the basal subgroup. A pilot survival study indicated that MYC- and E2F-activity may play a role in tamoxifen-resistance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumors.</field><field name="subject">Breast cancers.</field><field name="subject">Estrogen receptor.</field><field name="subject">Genes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of metastable carbide destabilization on metal dusting of ferritic iron</field><field name="creator">Al-Motin, Md. Abdulla, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Metal dusting corrosion has been known for more than a 100 years as an industrial problem. As a result of extensive research over the last five decades several mechanisms have been evolved involving ferritic materials. However, a complete understanding is yet lacking. One of the most referred models, developed by Hochman-Grabke, suggests that formation of metastable cementite and its subsequent decomposition is the central aspect of the process. To verify this hypothesis, an Fe-Si model was designed based on silicon's ability to retard cementite formation. However, this strategy was unsuccessful because silicon oxidized and amount of silicon remaining after silica formation was not sufficient to suppress cementite. On the other hand, germanium does not form a stable oxide in the conditions employed. A alloying with germanium did prevent Fe3C formation, but not dusting, which resulted from an alternative mechanism. Dusted particles were confirmed to be cementite for pure iron specimens (where cementite scale formed) and ferrite for alloys that did not form cementite. These observations are inconsistent with the prior model. In addition, the general features of metal dusting corrosion have been characterized. Kinetics of coking and metal wastage for ferritic materials (Fe, Fe-Si, Fe-Ge and Fe-Ge-Ni) were found to be linear in nature, though respective rates may vary due to the differences in alloy catalytic activity and reaction morphologies. The carbon diffusion coefficient in cementite was evaluated from Fe3C scaling rates. Crystallographic orientations of different forms of cementite were established. Internal cementite precipitates in pure iron accounted for by a very high degree of supersaturation with respect to carbon, indicating a non-equilibrium situation. Coking and dusting rates were found to be strongly correlated and their gas composition dependence indicate the contribution of the Boudouard reaction. Reactions with fixed carbon activity gases demonstrated that kinetics rather than thermodynamics control the reaction rates. However, at a particular temperature, these rates increase with carbon activity. Activation energies for coking and dusting are equal for a given alloy, meaning that the same process controls them. For Fe-lOGe alloy, in the early stages of reaction, grains with near (001) surfaces were more susceptible to graphitization than grains having near (110) surfaces, but the underlying cause has not been revealed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbides.</field><field name="subject">Iron.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Oligo-Miocene pseudocheirid diversity and the early evolution of ringtail possums (Marsupialia)</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Karen K, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The marsupial family Pseudocheiridae is currently known from seventeen species of six genera in Australia and New Guinea. These small to medium-sized arboreal animals are nocturnal and folivorous. Extinct pseudocheirids are recognised from several mid to late Cenozoic fossil localities across Australia and New Guinea. The single largest collection of pseudocheirid fossils has been recovered from the Oligo-Miocene freshwater carbonates of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwest Queensland. This collection, which includes the first pseudocheirid cranial fossils, forms the basis of this investigation. Three new extinct pseudocheirid genera together containing four species are identified and described. Six new species of Paljara, Marlu and Pildra are also described from Riversleigh. Two of the new Marlu species are reported from South Australia??s Leaf Locality. From Riversleigh, Marlu kutjamarpensis is identified and additional material of Paljara tirarensae and P. nancyhawardae documented. New species attributed to Marlu and Pildra necessitate revision of those genera. Cranial material is identified for three of the new species. The rostrum of archaic pseudocheirids is shorter than in extant forms but cranial morphology is similar overall. Phylogenetic relationships of all extinct pseudocheirids are analysed. They include all new and previously described species, most of which have never been examined in a parsimony-based analysis. Two hypotheses of pseudocheirid evolution are presented: a paired lineage hypothesis and a single lineage hypothesis. Both hypotheses demonstrate that species of Paljara are not the most plesiomorphic pseudocheirids, Marlu praecursor does not cluster with other species of Marlu, the new genus Gawinga is most closely related to Paljara and there are no representatives of the extant genus Pseudochirops in any pre-Pliocene locality. All extant pseudocheirids cluster to form a crown clade sister to a stem lineage of Pseudokoala and Marlu species. Pseudocheirids are found in all Oligo-Miocene faunal zones of Riversleigh. Species of Paljara and Marlu are most frequently recovered from Faunal Zone B and C deposits respectively. Four pseudocheirid species biostratigraphically correlate the Kutjamarpu local fauna of the Leaf Locality with Faunal Zones B and C of Riversleigh, suggesting an early to middle Miocene age for both deposits. Modern pseudocheirids first evolved no later than the late Miocene from a descendant of the Marlu + Pseudokoala lineage when all other Oligo-Miocene pseudocheirids became extinct. At least three pseudocheirid lineages dispersed to New Guinea approximately five million years ago, but ecological barriers probably prevented subsequent migrations between the two landmasses.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Riversleigh</field><field name="subject">Marsupialia</field><field name="subject">Pseudocheiridae</field><field name="subject">Miocene</field><field name="subject">Ringtail possum</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Cenozoic</field><field name="subject">Petauroidea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Local players and global strategies - the transformative effects of accounting in strategising</field><field name="creator">Boedker, Christina, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the agency of accounting in strategising in a global network of practice. It problematises the ostensive tendency to 'black-box' the making of strategy and uses a field study to investigate how accounting makes people 'act' and strategise. Research methods include semi-structured interviews, reviews of business documents, and participant observations. Paper one develops a theoretical frame (Latour, 1986) to discuss the extant accounting-strategy literature. The frame encourages scholars to study accounting-strategy as 'relations' (performative) rather than 'objects' (ostensive) and illustrates how this may be done, also raising research questions to this end. Paper two finds that accounting templates and financial targets translate strategy in three ways, through visualisation, structuring and seduction. It confirms extant literature on surveillance and control, but also shows how financial targets have the power to seduce people and expand activity. Financial targets bring out a sense of adventure in people, an appetite to explore foreign lands and imagine a 'better' future - a sort of play/dream mode, which result in an expansion of activities. Paper three finds that also accounting time, rhythms and routines have agency in strategising. Whilst these invisible actors are hard to see with the human eye, they still 'act'. They stabilise strategy in local sites, yet also give rise to 'tinkering' and 'experimentation', which in turn result in new strategies (some of which come to travel the global network). It also finds that accounting arouses strong emotions in people. Economic incentives are not all; people strategise because of a desire for love and recognition, besides fear of dismissal. Both empirical papers bring out the tension of the agency of accounting. On the one hand, accounting narrows the range of possible options. It enables surveillance from a distance and has the potential to degrade people into an appendix of a process. Yet, on the other hand, accounting encourages reflexivity and sparks imaginations of 'better' futures, thus expanding activity. This study introduces an alternative perspective on accounting controls, one that recognises their 'hooking' power as lying with their 'indefiniteness of being' and their expanding potential.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of aerosol optical and physical properties in Darwin, Australia</field><field name="creator">Bouya, Zahra, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the analysis and results of aerosol physical and optical properties over Darwin, Australia, a coastal tropical site which is affected by smoke aerosols from biomass burning inland and sea salt aerosols brought in by the sea breeze. Continuous Multi Filter Rotating Shadow Radiometer (MFRSR) spectral measurements for the period March 2002 -June 2003, have been obtained from the Tropical Western Pacific facilities site in Darwin, part of the D.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program.  Atmospheric optical thickness was obtained using the Langley regression analysis and aerosol optical thickness was then obtained by removing the molecular and ozone contributions from the total atmosphere optical thickness. A regression analysis was performed on the aerosol optical thickness and the Angstrom exponent to identify the trends in seasonality. It shows a strong seasonal cycle with low optical thickness in autumn and high optical thickness in spring, coinciding with the peak of the biomass burning season.  The aerosol optical thickness data were inverted using the Constrained Linear Inversion technique to obtain the size distributions. A novel method, combining several different criteria, was used for classification of the size distribution into classes which could be related to biomass burning aerosols and sea salt aerosols. These classes showed variations with season and meteorological parameters. The wind diurnal cycle showed a significant signature on the aerosol size and loading, and the aerosol loading was also strongly linked to fire activity.  The aerosols observed over Darwin reflected different proportions of biomass and sea salt and variations in size over the whole year. The seasonal pattern in the aerosol properties over Darwin is found to be owing to the location of Darwin in the Tropical Warm Pool and the variety of aerosol types: smoke particles produced by the dry season burning conditions, and the sea salt aerosols associated with the introduction of cleaner maritime westerly and northwesterly winds. Aerosols are also affected by the high rainfall rate during the wet season, which washes out the aerosols from the atmosphere.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41520</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Salience asymmetries in the Implicit Association Test</field><field name="creator">Chang, Betty, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is the most popular indirect measure of attitudes in social psychology. It has been suggested that salience asymmetries are a non-associative contaminant of the IAT that threatens the accurate assessment of attitudes. Salience asymmetries in the IAT are claimed to correspond with visual search asymmetries, and differences in target familiarity. In this thesis, I propose that processing fluency is the common mechanism underlying both visual search asymmetries and familiarity. Several experiments were conducted to determine whether visual search asymmetries, familiarity, or processing fluency most reliably corresponds with salience asymmetry effects in the IAT.  The first series of experiments revealed that processing fluency is a better predictor of salience asymmetry effects in the IAT than is visual search asymmetry (Chapter 2). In Chapter 3, a novel method was developed to distinguish between the effects of valence and salience in the IAT. Using this method, I demonstrated that the effects of salience in the IAT are consistent with a fluency account of salience asymmetries. Familiarity was also shown to produce salience asymmetry effects in the IAT (Chapter 4), which is also consistent with the fluency account. When fluency and familiarity were set against each other in Chapter 5, it was processing fluency, rather than familiarity, that predicted salience asymmetry effects in the IAT. Although processing fluency is a good predictor of salience asymmetries, the results of Chapter 6 reveal that the fluency account cannot explain all examples of salience asymmetries in the IAT.  The data presented here are consistent with the view that the more fluently processed target category is compatible with the pleasant attributes on the grounds of salience asymmetries. The current experiments suggest that when there are valence differences between the target categories, salience asymmetries can potentially distort IAT effects. When the positive target category is more salient, salience asymmetries appear to increase IAT effects. In contrast, when the negative target category is more salient, salience asymmetries appear to decrease IAT effects. However, further evidence is required to determine how the effects of salience and valence combine in the IAT.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Psychology.</field><field name="subject">Implicit Association Test .</field><field name="subject">Salience asymmetries.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning Level Sets and Level Learning Sets: innovations in variational methods for data partitioning</field><field name="creator">Cai, Xiongcai, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation proposes a novel theoretical framework for the data partitioning problem in computer vision and machine learning. The framework is based on level set methods that are derived from variational calculus and involve a curve-based objective function which integrates both boundary and region based information in a generic form. The proposed approaches within the framework provide original solutions to two important problems in variational methods, namely parameter tuning and information fusion, collectively termed Learning Level Sets in this thesis. Moreover, a novel pattern classification algorithm, namely Level Learning Sets, is proposed to classify any general dataset, including sparse and non sparse data. It is based on the same optimisation process of the objective function directly related to the curve propagation theory used in level set theory.  The proposed approach learns the knowledge required for parameter tuning and information fusion in level set methods using machine learning techniques. It uses acquired knowledge to automatically perform parameter tuning and information fusion in level set methods. In the case of pattern classification, variational methods using level set theory optimise decision boundary construction in feature space. Consequently, the optimised values of the objective level set function over the feature space represent the model for pattern classification.  The proposed automatic parameter tuning and information fusion method embedded in the level set method framework has been employed to provide original solutions to image segmentation and object extraction in computer vision. On the other hand, the Level Learning Set has been extended and applied to a variety of pattern classification problems".  Several experimental results for each of the above methods are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and indicating the potential of the automatic and dynamic tuning and fusion approaches as well as the Level Learning Set model.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data partitioning.</field><field name="subject">Learning Level Sets.</field><field name="subject">Level Learning Sets.</field><field name="subject">Computer.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41532</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Characterisation of inflammatory markers and the Th1/Th2 response in localized scleroderma</field><field name="creator">Gold, Wendy Anne, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease of unknown etiology characterized by excessive fibrosis and is broadly divided into two clinical entities: localized scleroderma (LSc) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is a multi-system disease resulting in both skin and visceral organ fibrosis. The more benign disorder, LSc is for the most part self-limited with the disease pathology being confined to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Proposed factors involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders include endothelial cell injury and dysfunction, immunological alterations and inflammatory activation, and abnormal ECM production by activated fibroblasts. However, the initiating mechanisms that leads to these changes remains largely unknown. This thesis examines the hypothesis that the transcriptional expression at the edge and centre of expanding LSc plaques could represent the metabolic changes involved in the different stages of disease.  The major finding of this thesis was the identification of two panels of genes that showed significant changes in expression between LSc patients and healthy controls irrespective of whether the sample was taken from a diseased or clinically unaffected area of the patient. The first panel consisted of inflammatory genes including those genes characteristic of the Thl response and those induced by NF-KB. The Thl response was supported by an increased infiltration of CD4+ T cells in the LSc patients. The second panel consisted of a subset of array identified genes (scleroderma Signature) in SSc patients. Of interest, WIF1 was down regulated in both disorders and showed a gradual decrease in expression across the clinically different areas of the LSc patients. Both panels of genes showed the biggest changes of expression at the edge of the plaque suggesting their involvement in the initiating events of the disease.  These results suggest that, like SSc, the underlying pathology of LSc is related to systemic changes in genes controlling amongst others, immunological and inflammatory responses. This information not only sheds light on the mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of scleroderma, but could also contribute to the creation of a diagnostic test for the early detection of sufferers of this rare, but important disease.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Systemic sclerosis.</field><field name="subject">Tissue disease.</field><field name="subject">Localized scleroderma.</field><field name="subject">Genes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41534</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honeycomb structured porous film from amphiphilic block copolymers for biomedical applications</field><field name="creator">Wong, Kok Hou, Centre for Advanced Macromolecular Design, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent times, it was divulged that highly ordered honeycomb structured porous films from a variety of polymers could be fabricated by breath figures (water droplets) templating technique. In contrast to existing macroporous fabrication techniques, this technique is simple, more versatile and very cost effective.  Amphiphilic block copolymers composed of a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic block were employed in this research to examine the process of porous film formation and the outcome of films generated using breath figure technique. A customized film casting system, established according to the casting parameters affecting the outcome of films was used to generate honeycomb structured porous films for the studies. The casting method best suited to generate highly ordered honeycomb structured porous films and the procedures to manipulate the size of the pores in films generated from amphiphilic block copolymers were also investigated and identified.  Analyses into the formation process of the honeycomb structured porous films revealed that the airflow casting method where the cast of polymer solution was supplied with a flow of moist air was the most suitable method to generate highly ordered honeycomb structured porous films from amphiphilic block copolymers. Variations to the casting conditions of the airflow casting method such as the rate of moist airflow could only provide limited alterations to the size of pores on films generated. However, changes to the chemical system of the casting solution such as the concentration and the molecular weight of polymers in the polymer solvent was more prominent in manipulating the size of pores in the generated films. On the other hand, any extreme variations to either the physical conditions or the chemical system could devastate the hexagonal arrangement of pores in these films.  In the synthesis of amphiphilic block copolymers in this research, RAFT polymerization technique was used to generate the hydrophobic polymer block followed by the subsequent chain extension polymerization of the hydrophilic polymer block. The polymerization 'process, especially the hydrophilic chain extension polymerization, was investigated in details. It was established that there were significant dependence on the composition of the initial polymer block used, particularly the molecular weight and the type of chain transfer (RAFT) end group in the hydrophobic polymer chain. Incompatible RAFT end group and high polymer molecular weights of the initial block usually lead to slower rate of subsequent chain extension coupled with increased terminations. These copolymers generated were usually bimodal in molecular weight distributions and broad in polydispersity indexes. Honeycomb structured porous films generated from one of these amphiphilic block copolymers were assessed as scaffoldings for cell culture to regenerate cells. In particular, the effects of cellular attachments and proliferations on the honeycomb porous structures were investigated. The assessment of these honeycomb structured porous films indicated that not only were these films not cytotoxic but they also enhanced the quantity of cellular proliferation (2.7x) when used as cell culture substrate compared to standard non-porous polystyrene cell culture surfaces.  Finally, this research had shown a simple way to generate a new class of highly ordered porous material that could be customized individually for a wide range of applications. The synthesis of amphiphilic block copolymers to generate these films could be achieved by RAFT polymerization with a board selection of polymers choices according to applications. A porous cell substrate such as honeycomb structured porous films could enhance cellular growth when used as a cell culture substrate.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Honeycomb structures.</field><field name="subject">Copolymers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41493</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enhancing membrane processes for water reuse</field><field name="creator">Parameshwaran, Kathiravelu, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study reported here was aimed at optimising the microfiltration (MF) membrane process applied to water reclamation. Polypropylene hollow fibre membrane (0.2 ??m) with high pressure backwahing was mainly used in this study.  To obtain secondary effluent for microfiltration a biological treatment (UASB/SBR) was applied to brewery effluent. It was identified that loading at a rate below 14 kg COD/kLd will ensure the stable performance of UASB. An initial energy balance of the system (Biological and MF) shows a plant treating brewery effluent (4000 mg/L COD) could yield a net energy of 2.5 kWh/kL (yield from methane less the plant operating energy) at an optimised MF flux.  For the MF of low solids feed it was found that crossflow has no benefit and that intermittent dead end filtration is less productive than dead-end cycles. It was also that found cycle time between air backwashes is strongly dependent on the imposed flux and the maximum TMP allowed. Analysis based on energy and capital cost indicates that if energy saving is the objective the unit needs to be operated at low imposed flux. However, if capital and energy costs are combined, cost efficient operation would be at about 60 to 70 L/m2.h for TMPmax of 20 kPa or above 80 L/m2.h for TMPmax of 50 kPa.  For cycles with a TMPmax of 20 kPa, the specific cake resistance was constant over the range of imposed fluxes. However, for a TMPmax of 50 kPa the specific resistance was higher and increased with imposed flux, signifying compressible cake formation. Further analysis of the TMP profiles showed that the membrane resistance increased over a number of cycles and that the increase was higher at higher flux. To fully optimise the operation, it would be necessary to include these factors. Laboratory scale studies with yeast showed many similarities with secondary effluent filtration. However, some inconsistencies were observed at lower f1uxes, which need to be confirmed by further studies.  Life cycle assessment of the membrane filtration process indicated that operating at low flux (10 Llm2.h) with higher TMPmax is the environmentally sound operational strategy. The analysis highlights the fact that the environmental impacts mainly come from the membrane operation (more than 85%). When alternative energy sources are considered, the least impact operational strategy shifts towards higher flux (in the vicinity of 30 l/m2.h).  In-situ electrochemical cleaning using an electrolysis process indicated better flux recovery than traditional chemical cleaning. However, repeated cycles of fouling and cleaning showed electrochemically cleaned membranes have a higher fouling tendency than the chemically cleaned membrane. Initial characterisation of membrane surface properties after cleaning could not provide conclusive evidence for the cause of rapid fouling of the electrochemically cleaned membrane.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fouling.</field><field name="subject">Membrane filters.</field><field name="subject">Water reuse.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The politics of pressure: Jewish liberalism and apartheid South Africa</field><field name="creator">Leibowitz, Louise, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The apparent complicity of South African Jews with apartheid rule is of social scientific interest in that it is unexpected. Pronounced left-liberalism is considered to be the default position of Jewish politics in Western societies. Yet in South Africa, while a small minority of Jews were conspicuous players in left-radicalism, the vast majority of Jews seem to have complied with the discriminations and injustices of apartheid. This thesis challenges the commonplace assumption that the political records of SA Jewry under apartheid refutes the oft-noted pattern of left-liberalism among modern Jews in the Diaspora. I argue that political actions do not necessarily reflect political values, especially under authoritarian regimes. Jews may strongly subscribe to liberal values, but, as a result of pressures both extrinsic and intrinsic to their particular communities, be less able or less willing to express these values in a politically overt manner than Jews elsewhere. I suggest that, in the South African case, voting patterns and official postures obscure rather a Jewish preference for liberal values.  The Jewish community in SA while unusually cohesive was, like other Diaspora communities, not monolithic. The ???united front??? presented by the Jewish community in apartheid SA disguised a predictably diverse range of political opinion. It is appropriate that our quest to understand and explain political values goes beyond that which is openly expressed and peers into the shadows of political behaviour. The point is not to morally redeem the South African community, whose record, after all, may still be found wanting. Rather, it is to recognise that hidden in the official deliberations and directives, and in the domestic dilemmas and incidental actions of SA Jews, is the material from which we may form a fuller picture of SA Jewish political values. More generally the case highlights the complexity of studying, comparing, and generalising about political behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liberalism -- South Africa.</field><field name="subject">Apartheid -- South Africa.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Channel assignment in multi-radio multi-channel wireless mesh networks</field><field name="creator">Naveed, Anjum, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Channel assignment in wireless mesh network (WMN) aims at improving the network throughput by utilizing multiple orthogonal frequency channels to minimize the interference. Interference can be categorized as coordinated and non-coordinated, depending upon the relative location of the interfering links. Compared to coordinated interference, non-coordinated interference has a severe adverse impact on throughput. This thesis is based on the hypothesis that the network throughput can be improved significantly, if channel assignment minimizes non-coordinated interference with priority. We propose a static and centralized channel assignment scheme CCAS to show the effectiveness of the hypothesis. The cluster-based approach of CCAS minimizes non-coordinated interference with reduced complexity. CCAS improves the network throughput by upto 80%, compared to the existing schemes. We propose topology control scheme MATS that constructs low interference multipath network topology using a subset of links from physical topology. We report an additional improvement of upto 10% in the network throughput, when CCAS assigns channels to the links selected by MATS. In the final part of the thesis, we formulate generalized channel assignment as an optimization problem, accounting for real network traffic. The objective of the problem is to select the channels for links such that maximum incident traffic can be transmitted over the links, while ensuring a fair distribution of throughput amongst links and elimination of non-coordinated interference. For a given network and incident traffic, the solution to this problem generates the channel assignment resulting in optimal network throughput. We propose dynamic and distributed scheme LYCAS as an approximate solution to the problem. LYCAS employs MATS to construct network topology and cluster-based approach of CCAS to minimize non-coordinated interference. In addition, it periodically updates the assignment of channels to adapt to the changing traffic load. LYCAS achieves upto 68% of the optimal network throughput and upto 72% of optimal aggregate end-to-end throughput of multi-hop flows. It outperforms the existing schemes by a factor of 2.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Centralized channel assignment scheme.</field><field name="subject">Channel assignment.</field><field name="subject">Wireless mesh networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41500</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of substance P in the pathogenesis of pterygia</field><field name="creator">Chui, Jeanie Jin Yee, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pterygium is an ocular surface disorder characterised by centripetal invasion of the cornea by altered limbal cells, accompanied by fibrosis and neovascularisation. One of the enigmatic features of pterygium is its wing-like shape and the mechanism(s) supporting its centripetal growth remain to be elucidated. As the growth pattern of pterygia mirrors the radial arrangement of corneal nerves, we hypothesised that neuropeptides may facilitate its directional growth. In this thesis, we investigated the roles that the sensory neuropeptide substance P (SP) may play in the pathogenesis of pterygia given its known functions in corneal cell migration, proliferation, wound healing and neurogenic inflammation.  Using a modified Boyden chamber method, SP was shown to act as a chemoattractant to pterygium fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells, and this activity was diminish by blockade of its receptor (NK1). 3H-thymidine incorporation assays confirmed that our cell migration results were unrelated to SP-stimulated proliferation. A bead-based multiplex cytokine array detected secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and CCL2) from SP stimulated pterygium and limbal epithelial cells. Using real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we show that UVB stimulated transcription of the TAC1 gene followed by secretion of SP in ocular surface epithelial cell cultures. Finally, SP and NK1receptor immunoreactivity was identified in pterygium tissue, where overall, NK1receptors were up-regulated in pterygia. Furthermore, we identified a population of NK1 receptor positive mononuclear cells in pterygia that did not express lineage markers for T or B-Iymphocytes, macrophages or mast cells, but may represent immature haemopoietic cells that may have migrated in from the blood since these cells were also present in autologous conjunctival tissue.  In summary, SP may contribute to the shape of pterygia by facilitating migration of fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells into the normally avascular cornea. Additionally, UVB stimulates SP production in epithelial cells and the presence of SP contributes to inflammation in pterygia by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine release.  Finally, we identified a population of relatively immature, NK1 receptor positive cells in pterygia that may have been attracted by the presence of SP. Collectively, these results imply that SP may contribute to the pathogenesis of pterygia.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Substance P.</field><field name="subject">Pathogenesis of pterygia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of a computer for patterns</field><field name="creator">Madina, Duraid, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents novel aspects of the design of Strategist, a microprocessor designed to support efficient rewriting-based computation and pattern matching in particular.

Predicate compression allows processors which make use of predicated execution to save a significant amount of code space, issue bandwidth and energy, by compressing predicate register references in a way that makes use of their peculiar temporal distributions. Quadrature low-swing logic is a new logic style which allows significant improvements in efficiency for realising both simple and complex logic functions in modern semiconductor processes. Finally, we describe a high radix on-chip network design which allows low-latency communication to be sustained under high traffic loads despite its simple, bufferless routers.

As learners advance in specific subject domains, worked examples should be gradually replaced by practice problems with limited guidance. These studies compared immediate and delayed performance in transfer from examples to practice problems using example-problems pairs and gradual fixed fading of worked examples as well as a control condition of pure problem solving. These studies were conducted with employees of a financial services company in a classroom environment. In Experiments 1 and 2, the fading condition indicated possible benefits over the other conditions on immediate and delayed performance measures (although results were not statistically significant). Experiment 3 used a modified fading method and demonstrated that the fading condition performed marginally better than the problem solving condition on delayed performance measures (although results were not statistically significant). Even though the fading condition did not demonstrate significant advantages in immediate post-test measures, over time learners benefited most from this condition. Experiment 4 investigated if the delayed fading effect found in experiment 3 would be observed using far transfer test performance measures. The results of this experiment indicated that the fading condition performed marginally better than the problem solving condition on delayed transfer post-test performance (although results were not statistically significant). Generally the results of this thesis favored the fading condition over the example-problem and problem solving conditions, and the advantage of this condition was enhanced with greater performance in delayed and transfer post-test measures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Control condition.</field><field name="subject">Instructional guidance.</field><field name="subject">Financial services.</field><field name="subject">Performance measures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mass spectrometric characterization and analysis of anti-oxidative properties of medicinal herbs</field><field name="creator">Wang, Xiao Suo, School of Medical Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project was to investigate a range of medicinal herbs which have radical scavenging and antioxidant activities and then apply novel mass spectrometric techniques to investigate and analyse active components responsible for their pharmaceutical actions. A sensitive electron capture negative ionization of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (ECNI-GC-MS) method was developed to assess hydroxyl radical production, as indicated by 3.4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) production, which allows excellent evaluation of hydroxyl radical scavenging and antioxidant activity of a number of medicinal Chinese herbs. Melatonin is an effective multiple radical scavenger and antioxidant and has been used in this study for the comparison of radical scavenging activity with medicinal herbs. To analyse active compounds from herbal extracts, mass spectrometric techniques were used to separate components that suppressed hydroxyl radical production from Dimocarpus longan Lour, determine known ginsenosides from ginseng extracts as well as to identify and quantify melatonin in ten herbal extarcts. The results obtained indicated that 1) the utilization of alumina in the ECNI-GC-MS method diminished interferences from ???noise??? products in a Fenton-type reaction, which allows obtaining pure final hydroxyl radical product and this method demonstrated optimal sensitivity and reliability; 2) Aqueous extracts of all herbs analysed showed different levels of hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Dimocarpus longan Lour, Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat, Lonicera hypoglauca Miq, Ginkgo biloba L, Rehmannia flutinosa and Libosch Cornus officinalis Sieb all exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on hydroxyl radical production than melatonin. 3) Aqueous extract of Dimocarpus longan Lour. showed the greatest inhibitory effect on hydroxyl radical production among the other herbs tested. The active fractions of this herb eluted just after the void volume using HPLC suggesting that the active compounds responsible for radical scavenging activity are polar and water soluble. They may belong to phenol group of chemicals. 4) Herbal extracts using non-polar solvents showed no effect on hydroxyl radical production suggesting active compounds in those herbs are water soluble. 5) Different species and origins of ginseng were compared for their radical scavenging activity. Chinese fresh ginseng (Oriental ginseng) showed higher activity than Korean ginseng tablet and American ginseng. Seven known active ginsenosides were identified using HPLC-MS-MS. 6) Melatonin was found at varying concentrations in ten herbs, which may contribute to the radical scavenging activity of herbs, on the other hand, it may provide the justification of clinical use and food resources, particularly for those herbs contain high level of melatonin.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Herbs</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Antioxidants</field><field name="subject">Mass spectrometry</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19180</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metrics of environmental sustainability, social equity and economic efficiency in cities</field><field name="creator">Doust, Kenneth Harold, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the concept of sustainability in the context of the community expectation for sustainability in cities.  Effective sustainability performance requires all three pillars of environmental sustainability (stewardship), social equity and economic efficiency to achieve complementary outcomes rather than simply individual outcomes. For cities, one challenge of sustainability is centred on urban form, transport characteristics and the interactions between these and the communities they support. Better understanding of these dynamics is an important step in a meaningful interpretation of sustainability performance of cities.  Reviews of methodological gaps in sustainability performance of cities are framed into a statement of problem. Gaps include a holistic assessment framework, methodologies to better understand urban dynamics, the drivers that produce sustainability performance and to objectively measure the performance of all three pillars of sustainability.  The common transport planning and land-use planning methods are identified as suitable building blocks for improvements in sustainability assessment, and accessibility is established as an important part of sustainability.  In a new approach to sustainability analysis, a sustainability framework is formulated. A concept of "environmental sustainability - accessibility space" is introduced as a novel visualisation of sustainability performance. Propositions are formed that a city's sustainability performance can be analytically quantified and simply visualised in terms of the three pillars of sustainability.  Sydney, a global city with a history of planning, is the case study to empirically test the propositions, with the sustainability framework providing the conceptual reference points. Having developed a picture of the urban dynamics in the Sydney case study, the proposed sustainability metrics are developed and the propositions tested. Sustainability metrics consisting of three typologies are shown to indicate the sustainability performance characteristics for the three pillars of sustainability in terms of data set shape, frequency and spread in the "environmental sustainability accessibility space". The visualisations although built from many thousands of pieces of data provided a simple representation giving a holistic view of the sustainability characteristics and trends.  Collectively, the sustainability framework, sustainability metrics, companion urban dynamics metrics, and urban system measures are demonstrated as a meaningful methodology in assessing city sustainability performance.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environment.</field><field name="subject">Metrics.</field><field name="subject">Sustainability indicators.</field><field name="subject">Social equity.</field><field name="subject">Economic efficiency.</field><field name="subject">Cities.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41535</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of PKC&#949; in pancreatic &#946;-Cell secretory function and its contribution to the development of lipid induced secretory defects</field><field name="creator">Burchfield, James, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Type 2 diabetes accounts for 85-90% of all people with diabetes and is currently estimated to affect more than 180 million people worldwide, a figure estimated to double by the year 2030. Thus understanding the basic biology of glucose homeostasis and how it is altered during disease progression is crucial to the development of safe and effective treatment regimes.  The link between high dietary fat and the development of type Il diabetes is well established. Chronic treatment of pancreatic islets with the lipid palmitate induces defects in glucose stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) akin to those seen in the development of type Il diabetes. Previous studies from our group have identified the lipid-activated kinase protein kinase C epsilon (PKC&#949;) as a potential mediator of some of these effects. Deletion of PKC&#949; in mice results in complete protection from high-fat diet induced glucose intolerance. This protection is associated with enhanced circulating insulin suggesting that PKC&#949; may be involved in the regulation of insulin release from the pancreatic &#946;-Cell.  The data presented here suggests that PKCs plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion under both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. We demonstrate that PKC&#949; can be activated by chronic lipid treatment and acute cholinergic stimulation. Under these conditions insulin secretion is enhanced by PKC&#949; deletion or inhibition suggesting that PKC&#949; is a negative regulator of insulin secretion. Mechanistically the PKCs mediated inhibition of insulin release by acute or chronic PKC&#949; activation appears to be distinct. The effect of PKC&#949; induced by palmitate pre-treatment appears to be distal to calcium influx. The pool of pre-docked vesicles is enhanced in palmitate pre-treated &#946;-cells lacking PKC&#949; suggesting that PKC&#949;  may be involved in the regulation of vesicle dynamics.  In contrast, calcium dynamics induced by cholinergic stimulation are altered by PKC&#949; deletion, suggesting an effect on either the calcium channels themselves or on the upstream signalling. Given the ability of PKC&#949; to inhibit insulin secretion, inhibition of PKC&#949; in the &#946;-cells of people suffering from insulin resistance and (or) type II diabetes represents a novel target for the treatment of type II diabetes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pancreatic &#946;-Cell.</field><field name="subject">Diabetes.</field><field name="subject">Protein Kinase C epsilon (PKC&#949;).</field><field name="subject">Glucose Stimulated Insulin secretion (GSIS).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41539</field></doc><doc><field name="title">UV initiated reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer polymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylic acid in aqueous solution at ambient temperature</field><field name="creator">Song, Wentao, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It was demonstrated for the first time that RAFT polymerizations of NIPAAm can be carried out directly in water at room temperature without photo initiator under UV radiation. Under these conditions, the controlled/living features could be proven for a large range of monomer/RAFT agent ratios. Moreover, even at a monomer conversion exceeding 80%, polymerization control (PDI&lt;1.2) is maintained. It is also demonstrated that the RAFT polymerization of AA can be carried out without photo initiator in water at ambient temperature in the presence of TRITT at short wavelength. At these wavelengths, the controlled/ living characteristics is maintained even at a monomer to polymer conversions exceeding 80%. UV/Vis spectrometry was employed to monitor the functional group (-S(C=S)S-) changes of the employed trithiocarbonate RAFT agent S,S???-Bis(??,?????-dimethyl-acetic acid)-trithiocarbonate (TRITT) in aqueous solution when exposed to UV radiation. It is shown that the degradation pattern of TRITT alone as well as TRITT in the presence of NIPAAm deviate from each other. Surprisingly, it is found that TRITT completely decomposed at 254 nm while the addition of monomer prevented the decomposition of TRITT at the same wavelength. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques were applied to study the decomposition products of TRITT in solution without the addition of monomer. Methanol-d4 was selected as the solvent. In addition, high-resolution soft ionization mass spectrometry techniques were used to map the product species generated during UV radiation induced RAFT polymerizations of NIPAAm and AA in aqueous media, allowing for the tentative assignment of end groups. The NMR analysis suggests that the decomposition of TRITT in methanol-d4 under UV radiation has three cleavage patterns. These three cleavage patterns (described in the current thesis in detail) all occur at the ???S(C=S)S- group, which is the weakest structural unit in TRITT molecule. iii However, polymerization occurs prior to decomposition, if monomer is present. The mass spectrometric analysis suggests that the initial radicals result from the dissociation of TRITT, as well as monomer. Trithiocarbonate end group degradation leading to the formation of thiol terminated chains is also occurring. In the case of NIPAAm polymerization, a peak which may be associated with a cross termination product of the intermediate radical was observed under both 302 nm and 254 nm wavelength irradiation. Interestingly, this peak does not occur in AA polymerization at any wavelength (nor is it expected to form under conventional RAFT conditions and was not observed in previous mass spectrometry studies in thermal or ??-initiated polymerizations of NIPPAm with TRITT) and thus this assignment should be treated as very tentative only.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acrylic Acid</field><field name="subject">UV initiation</field><field name="subject">RAFT polymerization</field><field name="subject">N-isopropylacrylamide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/39170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of 3D-EBSD and its application to the study of various deformation and annealing phenomena</field><field name="creator">Mateescu, Nora-Maria, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The ability to generate three dimensional (3D) microstructures in solids is of great importance in understanding their true nature, as it eliminates speculation about the spatial distribution of features associated with conventional two dimensional (2D) imaging techniques. There are several recently-developed 3D techniques for determining the spatial distribution of microstructural features, each with a given resolution. There is considerable interest in the development of a specific serial sectioning methodology, termed 3D electron backscatter diffraction (3D-EBSD), which combines a focused ion beam (FIB) with EBSD interfaced to a field emission gun scanning electron microscope. Here, FIB is used as a serial sectioning device for cutting parallel slices of single- and multi-phase materials with a site-specific accuracy of up to 50 nm. Each consecutive slice is mapped by EBSD and the complete dataset combined using advanced computer algorithms to generate a volume of a material whereby the true crystallographic features can be analyzed at submicron resolution.  The aims of the thesis was to develop 3D-EBSD into a powerful materials analysis tool and use it to resolve several issues concerning the nature of the deformed state and the nucleation and the growth behaviour of recrystallizing grains. The study commenced with an investigation into the effect of material type (restricted to face centred cubic AI, Cu and Au metallic crystals), FIB milling conditions and EBSD software variables on the quality of EBSD patterns generated on ion-milled surfaces of these materials. The effect of material type on EBSD pattern quality following FIB milling was found to be significant with relatively poor quality EBSD patterns obtained for metals of low atomic number. It was demonstrated, particularly for the high atomic number metals, that moderate FIB milling currents (~1-5nA) generated good quality EBSD maps from a given ion-milled surface. This preliminary work was necessary for balancing the time required for serial sectioning during 3D-EBSD and the generation of sufficient quality EBSD maps from each ion-milled surface. The outcomes of this investigation were applied to two major 3D-EBSD investigations on the microstructural and crystallographic characteristics of: (i) deformation features generated in a cold rolled interstitial free (IF) steel, with particular emphasis on the formation of microbands; and (ii) recrystallization of a cold rolled nickel alloy containing coarse (&gt;1 ??m) silica particles, with particular attention given to the generation of particle deformation zones and their influence on nucleation and growth of recrystallizing grains including particle stimulated nucleation (PSN), twin formation  during PSN and the growth behaviour of various types of grain boundary into the deformation microstructure. The foregoing 3D-EBSD studies were significant as they revealed various microstructural and crystallographic features not usually clearly evident in conventional 2D micrographs obtained by either EBSD or optical metallography. For example, the technique demonstrated that microbands in cold rolled IF steel consist of irregular curved surfaces that reconcile findings that microbands straight and aligned parallel to slip planes when viewed in normal direction-rolling direction sections but are wavy in transverse direction-rolling direction sections. Three slip planes were found within the angular range of the curved surface of the microband, which indicates that multiple slip planes are operative during deformation. The work also showed the influence of particle diameter on the misorientations generated within particle deformation zones and clearly showed that particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) occurred at particles greater than 1.5-2 ??m. It was observed that PSN in the nickel sample also generates contiguous grains separated by both coherent and incoherent twin boundaries and, on further growth of these grains into the matrix, the coherent boundary dominates and remains parallel to the primary growth direction of the grains.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Particle stimulated nucleation (PSN)</field><field name="subject">3D electron backscatter diffraction (3D-EBSD)</field><field name="subject">Focused ion beam (FIB)</field><field name="subject">Deformation and annealing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41541</field></doc><doc><field name="title">SPARK: a keyword search system on relational databases</field><field name="creator">Luo, Yi , Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the increasing usage of storing textual data into relational databases, there is a demand for the databases to support keyword queries over textual data. Due to the normalization and the inherent connections among tuples in different tables, traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluation methods do not apply. A number of systems have been proposed to deal with this issue. In this thesis, I will give a detailed demonstration and description to our SPARK project. In the project, we study both the effectiveness and the efficiency issues of answering top-k keyword query on a relational database system. We propose a new ranking formula by adapting existing IR techniques on a natural notion of ???virtual document???. Compared with previous approaches, our new ranking method is simple yet effective, and agrees with human being???s perception better. We also study efficient query processing methods based on the new ranking method, and propose algorithms that have minimal accesses to the database. We have conducted extensive experiments on large-scale real databases using two popular RDBMSs. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvement to the alternative approaches in terms of both retrieval effectiveness and efficiency.

Despite a growing enthusiasm for the aims of restorative justice, there has been some concern as to whether this process actually works in practice. This reinforces the need for careful management of restorative practices, as it is essential for safeguarding the integrity of the process. Trained facilitators usually run restorative processes such as conferencing, however, the topic of conference management has remained surprisingly underdeveloped in the research literature. The aim of this study is to examine in detail approaches to facilitation, as this is a key element of conference practice.  Conference facilitation is examined in this study as an occupation, and the process of occupational socialisation is regarded as central to an understanding of facilitation practice more broadly. The research is based on Youth Justice Conferencing in New South Wales. The thesis makes use of qualitative data collected from observing 45 conferences and interviewing 60 convenors and managers. The theoretical element of this study draws on ideas from the literature on occupations and organisations.  The key findings from the research show the complexity of conference practice and the strategies facilitators use to cope with the unpredictability of conferencing. Even though facilitators' primary occupational experience helped them adjust to their conferencing work it also clouded their facilitation practice in less than ideal ways. A major finding was that while facilitators all received the same training they adopted a variety of facilitation styles. A central argument of this thesis is that facilitation is a skilful accomplishment that is deeply embedded in the procedures and rituals of restorative justice that it is largely taken for granted and remains unrecognised.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ferroelastic domain switching behaviour in lead zirconate titanate under mechanical and electrical loading</field><field name="creator">Imlao, Soodkhet Bond, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, ferroelastic domain switching behaviour of lead zirconate titanate ceramics, as used in devices such as actuators, was studied. In particular, the effect of cyclic frequency and amplitude were assessed to develop a correlation between macrostructural changes and fatigue behaviour, both in the bulk and in crack-tip process zones.  A variety of experimental methods were used. Raman scattering enabled the poling state of the ceramics can be determined. However, it could not distinguish between the different preferred orientations of in-plane c-domains. Conversely, neutron and X-ray diffraction technique can detect domain orientation distribution and the preferred direction of c-domains. In this study, neutron diffraction was used to probe domain switching behaviour in bulk samples while high spatial resolution X-rays were employed to analyse a switching zone near a crack tip.  Under cyclic mechanical loading, domain switching and the accumulation of ferroelastic strain becomes saturated with increasing number of cycles. Moreover, time-dependent deformation was investigated. The results show that a domain forward-switching process occurs during creep deformation while a domain backward-switching process takes place during recovery. In addition, it was found that the frequency of applied stress affects the saturation of the ferroelastic strain while its magnitude has an influence on the level of strain accumulated.  Under static mechanical loading, it was found that the size of the crack-tip zone where stress-induced domain switching occurs with increase in the stress intensity factor but the degree of domain switching around the crack tip changes only slightly. Under cyclic electrical loading, the results present a strong link between the frequency of the applied field, remnant polarisation, domain switching and the resultant crack growth. The results show that polarisation fatigue, the size of the switching zone, and the crack growth rate is greater at lower loading frequency.  The quantitative analysis of the time dependent mechanism as well as the effect of loading frequency and amplitude on domain switching was achieved by applying viscoelastic models. Importantly, these models can be used to explain domain switching behaviour and domain wall movement under cyclic loading and link these processes to macroscopic deformation.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrical loading.</field><field name="subject">Domain switching.</field><field name="subject">Ferroelectric ceramics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41549</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Defendants, mental illness and negligence law: a critique</field><field name="creator">Bromberger, Nikki, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">At common law, liability in negligence is based generally on an objective standard of reasonable care. As a consequence of this idea those who possess reduced capacities, as compared to the ordinary reasonable person, may be held to standards which they are incapable of reaching. Yet there are exceptions to this general rule. Children are not required to behave the way reasonable adults behave. Rather, when the defendant is a child, courts take into account the capabilities which are a concomitant of the defendant???s age. A defendant???s mental illness, on the other hand, is not considered by courts in Australia (or elsewhere) to be relevant when determining liability in negligence. It has been argued that in this regard the common law is incoherent and unfair. This thesis considers whether these claims of incoherence and unfairness can be substantiated. In so doing, it considers the philosophical underpinnings of tort law in order to explore possible bases for the current law. It also examines a number of more specific accounts which attempt to justify the present law as it relates to mental illness. It is argued that none of these discussions provide a convincing basis for the different treatment in law between child defendants and defendants with a mental illness. The discussion extends beyond the confines of tort law to criminal law for explanations for the apparent incoherence. It notes the suggestion that the criminal law???s response to defendants with a mental illness has been fuelled to some extent by a misunderstanding of mental illness and a fear of those suffering from such illnesses. The thesis examines whether this negative attitude towards mental illness, which some scholars have referred to as ???sanism???, is at work in the few Australian decisions which have considered the common law position in relation to mentally ill defendants. Possible changes to this area of law are then outlined and considered.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41550</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards topological mapping with vision-based simultaneous localization and map building</field><field name="creator">Lee , Chun-Fan, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although the theory of Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) is well developed, there are many challenges to overcome when incorporating vision sensors into SLAM systems. Visual sensors have different properties when compared to range finding sensors and therefore require different considerations. Existing vision-based SLAM algorithms extract point landmarks, which are required for SLAM algorithms such as the Kalman filter. Under this restriction, the types of image features that can be used are limited and the full advantages of vision not realized.  This thesis examines the theoretical formulation of the SLAM problem and the characteristics of visual information in the SLAM domain. It also examines different representations of uncertainty, features and environments. It identifies the necessity to develop a suitable framework for vision-based SLAM systems and proposes a framework called VisionSLAM, which utilizes an appearance-based landmark representation and topological map structure to model metric relations between landmarks. A set of Haar feature filters are used to extract image structure statistics, which are robust against illumination changes, have good uniqueness property and can be computed in real time. The algorithm is able to resolve and correct false data associations and is robust against random correlation resulting from perceptual aliasing. The algorithm has been tested extensively in a natural outdoor environment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">SLAM systems.</field><field name="subject">Simultaneous localization.</field><field name="subject">Map building.</field><field name="subject">Vision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Lipid analysis of wild type and caveolin-1 knock out mouse embryonic fibroblasts</field><field name="creator">Li, Qiong, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this project is to characterise the levels of cholesterol and phospholipid in cell homogenates, plasma membranes and isolated membrane domains from wildtype (WT) and caveolin-l knock-out (Cav-1-/ -) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Quantitative lipid analysis was developed for cholesterol by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and for glycerophospholipids (GPL) and sphingomyelin (SM) by electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS).  In the cell homogenates, by comparing WT to Cav-l-/- MEFs, it was found that the total cholesterol as well as the proportions of the main GPLs such as Phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylserine (PS) was similar in both cell types. However, Cav-l-/- MEFs have higher levels of cholesterol esters than WT MEFs in whole cell homogenate. Furthermore, the proportion of SM is higher in Cav-l-/- than WT MEFs. These data suggest that Cav-l may control the balance between free and esterified cholesterol and is involved in SM metabolism. A small increase in SM level in Cav-l-/- compared to WT plasma membrane was observed but this increase was not significant. Similarly, cholesterol levels in the plasma membrane are comparable between the two cell types.  In both cell types, the levels of SM and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) are higher in the plasma membranes than in cell homogenates. In the WT cells, PE levels are higher in the plasma membrane than in the cell homogenates. While in the Cav-1-/- cells, the level of free cholesterol and PC are higher in the plasma membrane compared to the cell homogenate. PCs are the predominant lipids in both cell types. Cav-1-l - cells have more saturated fatty acyl chains in their PC species and shorter carbon chains compared to WT MEFs and this trend was found in both cell homogenate and plasma membranes. In PEs and SMs, Cav-1-/ - cells also have higher levels of saturated PEs and saturated amide-linkage SM than in WT cells, respectively. The results indicate that Cav-1 may also play a role in fatty acids metabolism.  In summary, the data from this work indicate that Cav-l expression affects lipid composition in MEFs including the relative distribution of free and esterified cholesterol, the levels of SM relative to other phospholipid subclasses and the incorporation of fatty acids into phospholipids.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phospholipids.</field><field name="subject">Fibroblasts.</field><field name="subject">Cholesterol.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The rise of China and its impact on Australia's relations with the United States</field><field name="creator">Shen, Yi, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Despite Australia enjoying good relations with both the United States and China at the moment, the long-term prospects are uncertain due to US-China strategic rivalry. The aim of this thesis is to examine Australia&#146;s ability to continue strong relations with both countries over the long-term. The thesis concludes that Australia may be able to maintain good relations with the US and China in the long run despite US-China strategic rivalry. The strategic competition only increases the prospect of conflict; it does not mean a US-China conflict is bound to happen. Although the risks of a US-China military confrontation over Taiwan are real, the chances are small due to America&#146;s continued strategic presence in the region and its military preponderance. If a Sino-US conflict were to occur, Australia would most likely side with the US despite China being economically significant to Australia. The United States is also critically important to Australia&#146;s economic interests and, ultimately, Australia&#146;s national security depends on its alliance with the US.

The Indonesian Government is interested in means by which the safety of these vessels can be improved, and this was the main catalyst for commencing research in this area. Any solution should be capable of being retrofitted to both existing vessels and new designs to improve their stability and, hence, their safety. The research therefore focused on the intact stability of the bare hulls, and with addition of side casings, for the vessels for which data was made available by the Indonesian Government.  The research covered both quasi-static analysis, based on the objective of meeting the IMO intact stability criteria, and a dynamic approach using time-domain simulation in regular beam waves. A parametric study of the stability parameters of the twenty vessels demonstrated that, without the presence of side casings, the vessels had difficulties in complying with the IMO intact stability criteria. The problems were solved by introducing side casings (watertight spaces above the vehicle deck) either inboard of the vessel&#146;s side-shell plating, or partially inboard and partially outboard of the side shell. The minimum extent (breadth) of side casings required was determined by iteration on each of the twenty vessels, incorporating variations in the height of the centre of gravity and loading conditions. The implementation of the minimum side casings showed that each vessel then met the IMO intact stability criteria.  However, the assessment of the vessels&#146; dynamic stability characteristics using time-domain simulation provided inconsistent results for these vessels with side casings which met the IMO intact stability criteria. For some particular conditions, the existence and the different forms of side casings could decrease vessel survivability by increasing the roll motion amplitudes for both inside and outside casings and could lead the vessel to capsize. The results of the dynamic stability analysis also confirmed the vulnerability of small vessels with small stability parameters to large waves, and the different roll seakeeping behavior of the different vessel stability parameters.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Side casings</field><field name="subject">Roll-on/roll-off passenger ferries</field><field name="subject">Ropax</field><field name="subject">Ship stability</field><field name="subject">Time domain simulation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44412</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cultural typologies and design meanings: a case study of Chinese media and entertainment websites from Singapore</field><field name="creator">Soh,  Choi Yin, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Internet offers new ways of imaging and 'imagining' national belonging and cultural identities in contemporary Chinese societies such as Singapore. The Chinese society is also a key representative in Tu Wei-Ming's first symbolic universe - including China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - under a 'Cultural China' (Tu 1994). Various cultural discourses indicate that this nation-state is capable of managing culture to maintain national competitiveness within global capitalism (Wee 2000, Chua 1995). This 'local national cultural ism' is significantly manifested in Chinese media and entertainment websites from Singapore. Within the Asia Pacific region, the notion of an emerging 'pan-Chinese' cultural identity for commercial exchange and interaction with regional and global markers has been an appealing economic construct (Nyiri 1999).  In Singapore the Chinese media and entertainment websites employ design strategies to attract foreign investors and cater for local 'heartlanders' with success. The Singapore media sire is carefully scrutinized, presented and aligned with its economic policies and agendas in presenting the country as a young and vibrant society. Although media and entertainment form a key aspect of popular culture in contemporary Singapore, the visual communication and content of the websites also provide an 'institutional memory' and design strategies which emphasize the distinctiveness of cultural identity. This is research interrogates the perception of 'Chinese' identity by Singaporean youth in a pilot study which analyses user responses to a prototype for interface design in web-based communication. In addition, a comparative analysis of three design components - colour, icon/symbol and visual metaphor ??? is examined with reference to the social construction of local, 'glocal' and cultural meanings in the media and entertainment websites-from Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. The research concurs with current literature that cultural identity is mediated by design and communicative strategies to resonate with the target audience. Although the design strategies for representing a 'pan -Chinese' identity have yet to be explored, 'Cultural China' plays a major role in regional/global economic development.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Information design.</field><field name="subject">Chinese cultural identity.</field><field name="subject">Interactive design.</field><field name="subject">Visual metaphor.</field><field name="subject">Media and entertainment website</field><field name="subject">Web sites -- China.</field><field name="subject">Web sites -- Singapore.</field><field name="subject">Web sites -- Design -- Government policy -- China.</field><field name="subject">Web sites -- Design -- Government policy -- Singapore.</field><field name="subject">Chinese -- Ethnic identity.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41561</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Engineering and acute physiological testing of a retinal neurostimulator</field><field name="creator">Suaning, Gregg J????rgen, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Electrical stimulation of retinal neurons is known to elicit visual sensations. When applied to the retina in a spatial pattern, electrical stimulation may be capable of providing rudimentary patterned vision that may be of benefit to sufferers of degenerative retinal disorders. No such device has yet been devised to provide for chronic study of the psychophysical perceptions elicited from a prosthesis for retinal stimulation. In this study, steps towards achieving this goal have been successfully carried out. Foregoing research was reviewed such that appropriate stimulation parameters were incorporated in the design of a 100 stimulation channel, complimentary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit, small enough in size so as to be capable of being implanted within the ocular anatomy or surrounding orbit. The device, and its associated external hardware and software were designed, modeled, fabricated, and interfaced with stimulating electrodes in acute testing in a highorder mammal (Ovis aries) so as to assess the capabilities of the device to elicit cortical potentials as a direct result of stimulation of the neural retina. Testing was performed under conditions similar to those anticipated in chronic in-situ configurations wherein radio-frequency telemetry was used to deliver power and configuration parameters to the device thus avoiding the passage of wires through tissue in order to communicate to the implant circuit. The results of the testing indicate that the circuit is indeed capable of eliciting physiological responses in the animal and evidence is present that these responses could be elicited in patterned form. Further work undertaken includes the development of surgical methods for implantation, and application of the prosthesis circuit in functional electronic stimulation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retina -- Pathophysiology</field><field name="subject">Electric stimulation</field><field name="subject">Vision -- Physiology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19203</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Anchorage and encapsulation failure mechanisms of rockbolts ??? stage 2</field><field name="creator">Weckert, Steven, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Fully Encapsulated Resin Bolt (FERB) is widely utilised for strata control and ground support in civil and mining applications worldwide, with approximately 6 million installed per annum by the Australian coal mining industry.  Independent studies have concluded that 30-35% of these rockbolts, which represents an annual expenditure of $40 million, are ineffective. The anchorage and failure mechanisms of FERB are yet to be quantified, and support systems are designed primarily from empirical rather than scientific methods.  There are no standardised methods of assessing FERB components, installation techniques and support behaviour.  The majority of research into FERB support systems remains commercial intellectual property, with little information released into the public domain. This thesis investigated several variables of FERB support systems, and also examined differences between field and laboratory pull-out test load distributions.  This research was conducted in two phases, with Phase 1 seeking standardised methodology and repeatability in results, while Phase 2 further refined Phase 1 methods and extended the range of tests.  The results in both phases were encouraging, with reasonable repeatability attained in all testing series.  The findings included:  ???	Annulus Thickness:  There was little change in load capacity with small annulus thickness, however the maximum peak load (MPL) significantly reduced once annulus thickness exceeded 4mm  ???	Resin Installation Spin Time:  Underspinning of cartridge resin was found to have an insignificant effect on rockbolt load/deformation characteristics.  Overspinning, however, led to a dramatic reduction in anchorage performance with a lessening in both MPL and stiffness  ???	Rockbolt Load Transfer:  The magnitude of an applied load reduced to zero along the length of the rockbolt, being greatest nearest the rock free surface (the point of load application).  An exponential reduction was found when tested in the manner of laboratory tests, with the loading jack reacting against the free surface.  This reduction was linear when the load was applied as in the field, with no load placed on the free surface This basic investigation into FERB support systems has validated many empirical understandings of rockbolts, while highlighting the need for further testing into several key areas.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mine roof bolts</field><field name="subject">Resin ??????

Antonio, School of Microbiology &amp; Immunology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Gram-positive bacterium, Rhodococcus sp. 33, was selected for further study to identify the characteristics conferring it with high tolerance to concentrations of benzene. Since most organic solvents, like benzene, are lipophilic, they tend to accumulate within lipid membranes where they express toxicity. The mechanisms conferring this Rhodococcus with resistance to benzene were hypothesised to be located within the subcellular region of this bacterium - cell wall, membrane, and cell-bound polymer. Therefore, this investigation was instigated to identify these mechanisms. To accomplish this, the development of methodologies to isolate highly purified cell wall and membrane fractions, from the organism, were required. To corroborate this investigation, a total of 6 benzene-sensitive mutants were prepared from Rhodococcus sp. 33 and their characteristics compared to those of the parent wild-type strain. 1-D PAGE analysis of proteins revealed various benzene-induced wall, membrane, and cytoplasmic proteins in the w-t. A protein band, with an approximate molecular weight of 58 kDa, was identified to be absent in the most sensitive mutant isolated (mutant M2b). Interestingly, much of this research showed that the benzene-catabolising enzymes played an insignificant role in tolerating the benzene. Gas chromatography and mass spectrometry of whole cell-derived fatty acids revealed that benzene induced an increase in the ratios of saturated/unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, protein determinations revealed that benzene induced an increase in the concentration of total membrane protein. These increases are suggestive as possible mechanisms to decrease the fluidity of the cell membrane. This was further supported by the observed increase in the generalised polarisation (GP) of laurdan fluorescence in the membranes during growth of the organism with benzene, which is correlated with a decrease in membrane fluidity. The organism was also found to synthesise hexadecenoic acid, 16:1w6c (11 - 13% of total fatty acids), an uncommon fatty acid and previously unreported in other Rhodococcus spp. Analysis of the organism's cell-bound extracellular polymer revealed it to be composed of polysaccharide with biosurfactant-like properties. Its function is proposed to act as a surfactant layer outside the cell, concentrating the benzene within its matrix and reducing benzene's contact with the cell membrane.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Actinomycetales</field><field name="subject">Benzene</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19233</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular Relatedness, Paternity and Male Alliances in Bottlenose Dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Kr??tzen, Michael Christian, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Male bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) in Shark Bay, WA, form several levels of alliances. Determining the relationship between paternity, relatedness and alliance membership is crucial in seeking evolutionary adaptive explanations for alliance formation. Previous behavioural data have revealed a social system whose complexity is unparalleled outside humans. Pairs or trios of male dolphins cooperate as stable first-order (1? alliances to sequester and control reproductive females. Two 1?alliances sometimes cooperate as small second-order (2? alliances to attack other 1?alliances or defend against attacks. Some males choose a different strategy by forming large superalliances of approximately fourteen individuals to attack 1?and 2?alliances. Kinship appears to play a role in the structuring of male alliances, but its importance differs with the alliance type. Relatedness analyses showed that on average, males in 1?and 2?alliances are strongly related, while members of the superalliance are not. Further, the strength of the association of partners within the superalliance was not correlated with their genetic relatedness. Thus, within one sex, it appears that there may be more than one simultaneous mode of group formation and its evolution. There was also an association between alliance behaviour and reproductive success as predicted by some theories of group formation. I assigned nine paternities to six out of 107 mature males. Males with alliance partners were significantly more successful in fathering offspring than males without partners. Compared to non-allied males, the chance of obtaining a paternity was significantly higher for members of 1?alliances, and reproductive success was significantly skewed among 1?alliance members. Assessment of kinship and relatedness required a number of technical developments and some preliminary data. I first refined a biopsy system in order to obtain tissue samples from free-ranging dolphins with minimum behavioural effects irrespective of age-group or gender. Then I carried out population genetics analyses, which demonstrated that there was only weak population structure within Shark Bay. Microsatellites showed a weak pattern of isolation by distance, and eight haplotypes of the mitochondrial DNA control region suggested weak female philopatry. The high number of migrants between locations allowed all samples from East Shark Bay to be pooled for subsequent analyses.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bottlenosed dolphins -- Western Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluating monitoring strategies, short-term disease progression and rate of treatment change in HIV-infected patients commencing antiretroviral therapy in the Asia-Pacific region</field><field name="creator">Srasuebkul, Preeyaporn, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses factors associated with a number of short and long-term outcomes in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral treatment in Asia. Analyses in this thesis were based on two cohorts of HIV-infected patients; The Treat Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD), a multi-centre prospective observational cohort from countries in Asia-Pacific region, and the HIV Netherlands Australia Thailand (HIV-NAT) collaboration cohort, a cohort of patients treated with antiretroviral treatments at HIV-NAT in Bangkok, Thailand.  We examined factors associated with time to immunological failure endpoints, such as CD4&#8804;  200 cells/??L, CD4&#8804; 100 cells/ ??L, and CD4 return to baseline, and with the virological failure endpoint, detectable viral load defined as a value greater than 500 copies/mL. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were used. Results showed that CD4 count at baseline and changes in CD4 strongly predicted immunological failure. For virological failure, detectable viral load at baseline was the strongest predictor.  As a step to developing simplified monitoring strategies, in which patients with a low risk of failure could have their monitoring CD4 count and viral load tests deferred, we developed predictive models for each immunological and virological failure endpoint. Models were developed on the HIV-NAT cohort, and validated on the independent TAHOD cohort. For predictive models, the complementary log-log transformation for each endpoint was fitted appropriate to the interval censored nature of the data. To assess goodness-of-fit, cut-offs were defined for the predicted risks that separated patients from low risk to high risk. Overall, the observed versus expected failures from HIV-NAT data agreed quite well across all endpoints, probably reflecting that the HIV-NAT database was the data we built the models upon. Not only did these models fit the HIV-NAT database well, they also discriminated patients from low to high risk groups. When we validated models with TAHOD data, the observed and expected failures agreed well only in the model for CD4 count return to baseline. For most of the endpoints, the predictive models overestimated the number of failures, with predicted values larger than observed. However, the proportions of failures were lowest in the low risk group and highest in the high risk group, indicating that our models did discriminate between patients at high and low risk, and that the predictive models might still be of use for the purpose of simplified monitoring strategies.  With CD4 count and viral load monitoring tests now comprising a large component of the cost of HIV treatment in resource limited settings, we developed and assessed a simplified monitoring strategy that aimed to reduce the numbers of monitoring tests performed. The predictive models developed earlier were used to calculate the probabilities of failure in TAHOD patients. We assumed that patients would have their CD4 and viral load assessments annually, at baseline and at one year, predicted risk of failure at ensuing clinical visits, week 12, 24 and 36. For patients at low predicted risk of failure at ensuing clinical visits, we assessed the effect of deferring monitoring tests, both in terms of blood tests avoided, and in terms of delaying detection of failure in some patients. A number of levels for the predicted risk of failure that lead to deferral of testing were evaluated. The results suggested that predicted probabilities of failure of 10% - 20% gave the best results across all failure endpoints. These cut-offs could save a median of 598 (51.6%) (range 37 (2.6%)_-1,218 (81.9%) ) blood tests over the first year of treatment, but would fail to detect 29 (18%) (range 10 (7.4%) - 128 (39.3%) ) failures. The median time from failure to detection in those patients who did fail and had deferred monitoring tests was 28 weeks.  Rates of antiretroviral treatment change in TAHOD were examined. We identified patterns and factors associated with the rate of treatment change. Median time to the first treatment change was 3.2 years. Factors predicting rate of treatment change in TAHOD were treatment combination, being on second or third combination, number of drugs available in each site and being an injecting drug user. The overall rate of treatment change in TAHOD was 29 per 1OO-person-year. Around 30% of patients stopped their treatment due to adverse events. These rates of treatment change are lower than have been seen in patients in western countries. This may be due to patients in developing countries having access to fewer antiretroviral drugs than patients in developed countries.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV infections.</field><field name="subject">Antiretroviral agents.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41673</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Musical instrument sound source separation</field><field name="creator">Gunawan, David Oon Tao, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The structured arrangement of sounds in musical pieces, results in the unique creation of complex acoustic mixtures. The analysis of these mixtures, with the objective of estimating the individual sounds which constitute them, is known as musical instrument sound source separation, and has applications in audio coding, audio restoration, music production, music information retrieval and music education.  This thesis principally addresses the issues related to the separation of harmonic musical instrument sound sources in single-channel mixtures. The contributions presented in this work include novel separation methods which exploit the characteristic structure and inherent correlations of pitched sound sources; as well as an exploration of the musical timbre space, for the development of an objective distortion metric to evaluate the perceptual quality of separated sources.  The separation methods presented in this work address the concordant nature of musical mixtures using a model-based paradigm. Model parameters are estimated for each source, beginning with a novel, computationally efficient algorithm for the refinement of frequency estimates of the detected harmonics. Harmonic tracks are formed, and overlapping components are resolved by exploiting spectro-temporal intra-instrument dependencies, integrating the spectral and temporal approaches which are currently employed in a mutually exclusive manner in existing systems. Subsequent to the harmonic magnitude extraction using this method, a unique, closed-loop approach to source synthesis is presented, separating sources by iteratively minimizing the aggregate error of the sources, constraining the minimization to a set of estimated parameters. The proposed methods are evaluated independently, and then are placed within the context of a source separation system, which is evaluated using objective and subjective measures.  The evaluation of music source separation systems is presently limited by the simplicity of objective measures, and the extensive effort required to conduct subjective evaluations. To contribute to the development of perceptually relevant evaluations, three psychoacoustic experiments are also presented, exploring the perceptual sensitivity of timbre for the development of an objective distortion metric for timbre. The experiments investigate spectral envelope sensitivity, spectral envelope morphing and noise sensitivity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sinusoidal estimation</field><field name="subject">Source separation</field><field name="subject">Music</field><field name="subject">Instrument modelling</field><field name="subject">Phase estimation</field><field name="subject">Psychoacoustic</field><field name="subject">Timbre</field><field name="subject">Spectral envelope</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41751</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Recoding jewellery: identity, body, survival</field><field name="creator">Cohn, Susan, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">RECODING JEWELLERY: identity, body, survival addresses a central problem facing contemporary jewellery practice: through the course of the Contemporary Jewellery Movement, the potential of the jewellery-object to mediate intricate social relationships has become constrained. This is in part due to a singular focus of ideas in the field, and in part due to the developmental trajectory of contemporary jewellery networks. Caught up in the art-craft debate, contemporary jewellery missed the potentials in theory for developing a critical voice. This was not helped by the fact that academic discourse (philosophical, social, sexual, political) has largely neglected the significances of jewellery.  The aim in this thesis is to negotiate this mutual neglect - or 'double gap' - by finding connections between theory and jewellery in practice. Jewellery involves complex interactions between makers, objects, wearers and audiences within social networks. Possessing a distinct set of codes enlivened by its relationship to the body, jewellery is a way of thinking and connecting which is strongly embedded in the activities of managing identity that define cultures and epochs. In the process, the instinct for adornment becomes an integral means of survival.  This thesis draws on modern and postmodern theory, as well as art and jewellery practices, to examine contemporary shifts in thinking about identity, the body and reproduction. Through the three main chapters of this thesis I endeavour to: (i) provide an informed interpretation of the internal and external pressures that have defined contemporary jewellery practice over time; (ii) introduce relevant examples of my own work, and seek ways to move beyond the limitations of my own practice; and (iii) advocate new ways of thinking about contemporary jewellery that might lead it to a different voice.  Reflected in this approach are three fundamental influences to my practice: the Contemporary Jewellery Movement; non-jewellery practices such as art, architecture, street culture, technology and performance; and academic writing across a number of fields. The thesis concludes with a discussion of how these interests came together in a single show, Black Intentions. However, the span of work covered extends through my career in jewellery to provide a basis for future directions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jewellery.</field><field name="subject">Contemporary jewellery networks.</field><field name="subject">Art.</field><field name="subject">Identity.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43809</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Fabrication and characterisation of SWCNT-PMMA and charcoal-PMMA composites with superior electrical conductivity and surface hardness properties</field><field name="creator">Mada, Mykanth Reddy, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fabrication of SWCNT-PMMA and Activated Charcoal- PMMA composites was carried out by the compression moulding technique.

These users increasingly require extensive applications and capabilities from the Internet, such as Quality of Service (QoS) optimized paths between end hosts. When default Internet paths may not meet their requirements adequately, there is a need to facilitate the discovery of such QoS optimized paths. Fortunately, even though the route offered by the Internet may not work (to the required level of performance), often there exist alternate routes that do work.  When the direct Internet path between two Internet hosts for instance is sub-optimal (according to specific user defined criterion), there is a possibility that the direct paths of both to a third host may not be suffering from the same problem owing to path disjointness. Overlay Networks facilitate the discovery of such composite alternate paths through third party hosts. To discover such alternate paths, overlay hosts regularly monitor both Internet path quality and choose better alternate paths via other hosts. Such measurements are costly and pose scalability problems for large overlay networks. This thesis asserts and shows that these overheads could be lowered substantially if the network layer path information between overlay hosts could be obtained, which facilitates selection of disjoint paths. This thesis further demonstrates that obtaining such network layer path information is very challenging. As opposed to the path monitoring which only requires cooperation of overlay hosts, disjoint path selection depends on the accuracy of information about the underlay, which is out of the domain of control of the overlay and so may contain inaccuracies. This thesis investigates how such information could be gleaned at different granularities for optimal tradeoffs between spatial and/or temporal methods for selection of alternate paths.  The main contributions of this thesis are: (i) investigation of scalable techniques to facilitate alternate path computation using network layer path information; (ii) a review of the realistic performance gains achievable using such alternate paths; and (iii) investigation of techniques for revealing the presence of incorrect network layer path information, proposal of new techniques for its removal.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer to Peer Systems</field><field name="subject">Quality of Service in the Internet</field><field name="subject">Resilient Overlay Networks</field><field name="subject">Service Oriented Networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44536</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalysis to produce hydrogen</field><field name="creator">Assanee, Natthakich, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study is focused on two studies. The kinetics 0: methane steam refonning over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure is reported in the first study. The second study is focused on the steam iron process over promoted Fe-oxide based catalyst using four different reductants; H2, H2 /CO mixture, CH4 and CH4 /C02 mixture.  A kinetic study of methane steam reforming over a Ni/MgO catalyst at high pressure was carried out. The kinetic orders of methane and steam at 40 bars and 600 QC were found to be 0.82 and 0.62 respectively. 1~he estimation of energy of activation of the process was found to be 106 KJ/mol. T11e reaction rate data was explained by a Langmuir - Hinshelwood - Hougen - Wastson model.  Four differe11t reductants (H2, H2 /CO mixture, CI-4 and CH4 /C02 mixture) , were applied for the study of the steam iron process. A study of the steam iron process using H2 as reductant focused on the first reduction of 4%Cr203 - 96% Fe203 with H2.  The first reduction was found to be composed of a two step reduction up to 550 QC. The estimation of energy of activation for the process was found to be 92.4 KJ/mol and 68.2 KJ/mol respectively.  The study of the steam iron process using H2 ICO mixture as reductant over 4%Cr203 - 96% Fe2O3 found that FeO was an intermediate for the reduction of Fe203 with H2ICO mixture to Fe metal.  The application of methane as reductant for the steam iron process gave the worst results. As a result, NiO was added to Cr203 -Fe203 to increase the activity. Carbon formation on NiO also was found to be a serious problem.  In order to minimize carbon formation on NiO, CO2 was introduced in a mix with CI-4 for the oxidation of deposited carbon during the reduction step. Although the introduction of CO2 can suppress carbon formation, the strong oxidation of reduced iron oxide by water formed during the reduction process coupled to the l1igher favorable reaction of the water gas shift reaction adversely affects the complete reduction of iron oxide to iron metal.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vertical and horizontal methods of peer learning in clinical examination skills</field><field name="creator">Thomas, Paul Simon, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Peer-learning enhances the learning experience of students, but little research in this area has studied medical students developing their clinical physical examination skills.  This thesis describes two peer-learning processes to aid this skill development: peer???learning from advanced beginners to novices (vertical); and peer-to-peer learning (horizontal).  The hypothesis was that the process would be effective and acceptable to tutors and tutees.  Vertical Peer Teaching: After a successful pilot scheme using junior doctors to tutor medical students, senior medical students were engaged as tutors as the junior doctors were too busy.  Following instruction in tutoring and defining teaching topics, they taught a group of junior students. Evaluation of both groups was by summative clinical examination scores, by interviews and questionnaires. Scores were compared with non-participating control subjects.  Tutors showed a significantly superior examination performance compared with the control group. Tutees showed a non-significant improvement.  Tutors considered their skills had improved, with increased confidence in both performance and teaching, particularly in the communication and metacognitive domains.  Tutees indicated the process to be very useful, with increased opportunity for feedback and questioning.  There was little evidence of a reduction in the barriers between the years, perhaps because the student tutors were viewed in the traditional role of 'experts' .  Horizontal Peer Teaching: Same-level dyads using a videotaped examination skill and script were assessed by summative examination and subjectively.  These skills showed a significant improvement when compared to a control group.  Despite this effect and many positive aspects reported, there were some concerns with the process.  Students felt that a videotape and a peer instead of an ???expert??? was not as good as a traditional tutorial.  In conclusion, the peer-learning was successful in several domains.  Vertical peer-learning was accepted by both tutors and tutees, and horizontal-peer learning had a positive influence upon examination results.  Vertical peer-learning appears to conform to students??? expectations of the inequality between beginners and tutors who are advanced beginners or experts, while horizontal peer-learning is more challenging, even though it is effective.  The latter may need careful introduction for the process to be acceptable to students.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Peer-group tutoring of students</field><field name="subject">Clinical medicine</field><field name="subject">Physical diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/19370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Speed of adjustment, volatility and noise in the Indonesia Stock Exchange</field><field name="creator">Husodo, Za??fri Ananto, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research contains three essays that explore the speed of adjustment, volatility and noise in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The first essay explores the speed of adjustment in the Indonesia Stock Exchange at daily interval from 2000 to 2004. The model employed is the speed of adjustment with noise. Firstly, I work on the estimation of the speed of adjustment. The estimated speed of adjustment coefficient concludes that the large size leads the smaller size group to adjust to new information. Secondly, I analyse the component in the noise that contributes significantly to the speed of adjustment level. It is confirmed that the factor determining the noise is bid-ask fluctuations. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer the component in the noise from bid-ask component. The decomposition of bid-ask spread into transaction cost and asymmetric information reveals that the latter is found to be a significant component determining the speed of adjustment level.  The second essay analyses the fine grain dynamics of the speed of price adjustment to new information from 2000 to 2007. The exact time of adjustment is estimated at intraday frequency instead of at daily frequency. In this work, as an alternative of first moment estimation, second moment model-free estimation using volatility signature plot to estimate of the speed of adjustment is proposed. Both first and second moment estimation of the speed of adjustment provide consistent result of 30 minute adjustment period. Negative relation after 5-minute return interval between speed of adjustment estimate and realized variance is found implying lower noise leads to smaller deviation between observed and equilibrium price.  In the third essay, I concentrate the work on the second moment of continuously compounded returns from 2000 to 2007 in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The main purpose of the last essay is to estimate the noise and efficient variance in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The realized variance based estimator is employed in the third essay. During the period of the study, noise variance decreases indicating smaller deviation between the observed and equilibrium price, hence improving market quality in the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The optimal frequency to estimate the efficient variance, on average, is nine minutes. The variance ratio of daily efficient variance to daily open-to-close reveals significant private information underlying price process in the Indonesia Stock Exchange.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Noise variance estimation.</field><field name="subject">Speed of adjustment.</field><field name="subject">Volatility signature plot.</field><field name="subject">Indonesia Stock Exchange</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/41860</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of copper-alumina composites for abrasive wear applications</field><field name="creator">Toth-Antal, Bence, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Copper-alumina composites were developed for testing in abrasive wear applications. The composites featured a porous continuous ceramic-preform network infiltrated by a liquid metal to form the final consolidated composite. The liquid metal phase was pure copper.  Six different ceramic preform variants were tested. Ceramic volume fractions of 40, 50 and 60% were used, of two preform types; one pure-alumina, and one with additional 2wt% copper(I) oxide (CU20), functioning as an infiltration aid, the effects of which were determined in a previous study; the copper-oxide reduced infiltration pressure and allowed the use of higher ceramic phase volume fraction in the final composite.  Abrasive wear tests against two automotive braking system materials were conducted. Grey cast iron of alloy type GG15 was used to establish a baseline for behaviour of the six different composite samples and compare them. Following this, the three volume fraction variants of samples using the copper-oxide infiltration aid were trialled against a commercially-available European passenger vehicle brake pad friction material; ABEX 6091.  Wear tests were conducted on a pin-on-disc tribometer. Hemispherical-headed pins were made from the composite and tested against rotating discs of the grey cast iron and the ABEX friction material. Contact velocity was kept constant at Ims-?? at room temperature in air, and contact loads up to 15N were used. Test loads of 1-4N were used against grey cast iron, and 15N against the ABEX friction material.  Optical micrography was used to monitor the wear rate of samples tested against grey cast iron. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to characterise bulk microstructures and evaluate surface wear features. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for further microstructural investigation of the sintering and interfacial features of the undamaged pin samples, as well as damage zones and tribofilm compositions. Focussed ion beam (FIB) milling was used to create subsurface cross-sections of wear regions and prepare TEM samples.  The wear performance of the different sample types was compared by ceramic content and preform additives. It was found that the wear resistance of pure-alumina preform composites was dependent on ceramic volume fraction. Increasing ceramic content lead to increased wear resistance. The lower sinter temperature of the samples with the copper oxide additive led to reduced wear resistance compared with the monolithic alumina preforms and changes in ceramic volume fractions were not discernable in wear resistance against grey cast iron. This could be further supported by qualitative micrographic observations. All tests against grey cast iron were dominated by tribochemical film formation, which was determined to be oxidation of the iron which formed at the composite pin contact surface.  Further testing of the copper-oxide containing samples against the ABEX friction material revealed a mixed result; the 50 and 60% ceramic volume samples produced near-identical wear performance, while the 40% sample suffered poor wear resistance. The dominant wear mechanism of composite pins tested against the ABEX friction material was abrasive wear. Sub-surface analysis of wear pins revealed a prominent damage layer forming at the contact surface of all pin samples which progressively grew into the bulk material. This layer was believed to have an important effect on the wear behaviour of the materials.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</field><field name="subject">Copper-alumina composites.</field><field name="subject">Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44504</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Supersonic liquid diesel fuel jets : generation, shock wave characteristics, auto-ignition feasibilities</field><field name="creator">Pianthong, Kulachate, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is well known that high-speed liquid jetting is one of the most powerful techniques available to cut or penetrate material. Recently, it has been conjectured that high-speed liquid jets may be beneficial in improving combustion in such applications as SCRAM jets and direct injection diesel engines. Although there are practical limitations on maximum jet velocity, a fundamental study of the characteristics of high-speed liquid fuel jets and their auto-ignition feasibility is necessary. Important benefits could be increased combustion efficiency and enhanced emission control from improved atomisation. The generation of high-speed liquid jets (water and diesel fuel) in the supersonic to hypersonic ranges by use of a vertical single stage powder gun is described. The effect of the projectile velocity and projectile mass on the jet velocity is found experimentally. Jet exit velocities from a range of different nozzle inner profiles and nozzle hardness are thoroughly examined. The characteristics and behaviour of the high-speed liquid jet and its leading bow shock wave have been studied with the aid of a shadowgraph technique. This provides a clearer picture of each stage of the generation of hypersonic liquid jets. It makes possible the study of hypersonic diesel fuel jet characteristics and their potential for auto-ignition. The fundamental processes by which a supersonic liquid jet is generated by projectile impact have been investigated. The momentum transfer from the projectile to the liquid and the shock wave reflection within the nozzle cavity are the key items of interest. A new one-dimensional analysis has been used in order to simplify this complex and difficult problem. The impact pressure obtained from the projectile was firstly derived. Then, an investigation of the intermittent pressure increase in a closed end cavity and a simple stepped, cross-sectional nozzle were carried out. The nozzle pressure and final jet velocity were estimated and compared to a previous method and to experimental results. Some interesting characteristics found in the experiments relate well to those anticipated by the analysis. The characteristics of a hypersonic diesel fuel jet and its leading edge shock wave were assessed for their potential for auto-ignition using fuel with cetane numbers from 50-100. The investigations were performed at normal ambient air and at elevated air (110 ???C) temperature. So far, there is no sign of auto-ignition that may occur because of the temperature rise of the induced shock.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jet cutting</field><field name="subject">Diesel motor</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20325</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autobiographical memory in complicated grief</field><field name="creator">Maccallum, Fiona Louise, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Complicated Grief (CG) has been identified as a potential consequence of bereavement that is associated with unique and debilitating outcomes.  This thesis investigated autobiographical memory in CG.  This program of research focused on the specificity and content of autobiographical memories in the context of CG.  Study 1 investigated memory retrieval specificity using a cue word paradigm.  Bereaved individuals with CG displayed an overgeneral retrieval style (OGM) compared to bereaved individuals without CG.  Study 2 found that CG participants were also less specific in imagining future events in response to positive cues.  Further, there was a significant independent relationship between memory retrieval specificity and the specificity of future imaginings.  Study 3 investigated the relationship between overgeneral memory and social problem solving.  CG participants performed more poorly on this task; however, there was no independent relationship with memory retrieval style.  Study 4 investigated the impact of treatment on OGM.  Results indicated that as symptoms of CG reduced following treatment, individuals retrieved more specific memories to positive cues.  Studies 5-7 examined proposed relationships between self construct and autobiographical remembering in CG, as outlined in Conway and Pleydell-Pearce??s (2000) self memory system model.  In Study 5, individuals with CG were more likely than bereaved controls to view their self-identity as being related to the deceased.  Study 6 investigated the relationship between self-discrepancy, personal goals and memory content.  CG individuals were more likely to recall loss-related memories, and there was a relationship between personal goals and memory content.  Study 7 extended examination of these factors to future-related thinking.  Finally, the program recognised the importance of investigating the impact of the cognitive strategies that individuals may adopt to manage painful memories.  Using an experimental Stroop procedure as a measure of thought accessibility, Study 8 investigated thought suppression in CG.  The results suggested that CG individuals experienced greater interference from death-related cues.  In summary, these studies highlighted some of the key memory processes that may be involved in the maintenance, and potentially the resolution, of CG.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self</field><field name="subject">autobiographical memory</field><field name="subject">complicated grief</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Customization of floating-point units for embedded systems and field programmable gate arrays</field><field name="creator">Chong, Michael Yee Jern, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">While Application Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIPs) have allowed designers to  create processors with custom instructions to target specific applications, floating-point units (FPUs) are still instantiated as non-customizable general-purpose units, which if under utilized, wastes area and performance.  However, customizing FPUs manually is a complex and time-consuming process. Therefore, there is a need for an automated custom FPU generation scheme.  This thesis presents a methodology for generating application-specific FPUs  customized at the instruction level, with integrated datapath merging to minimize area.  The methodology reduces the subset of floating-point instructions implemented to the minimum required for the application.  Datapath merging is then performed on the required datapaths to minimize area.  Previous datapath merging techniques failed to consider merging components of different bit-widths and thus ignore the bit-alignment problem in datapath merging.  This thesis presents a novel bit-alignment solution during datapath merging.  In creating the custom FPU, the subset of floating-point instructions that should be implemented in hardware has to be determined.  Implementing more instructions in hardware reduces the cycle count of the application, but may lead to increased delay due to multiplexers inserted on the critical path during datapath merging.  A rapid design space exploration was performed to explore the trade-offs.  By performing this exploration, a designer could determine the number of instructions that should be implemented as a custom FPU and the number that should be left for software emulation, such that performance and area meets the designer's requirements.  Customized FPUs were generated for different Mediabench applications and compared to a fully-featured reference FPU that implemented all floating-point operations.  Reducing the floating-point instruction set reduced the FPU area by an average of 55%.  Performing instruction reduction and then datapath merging reduced the FPU area by an average of 68%.  Experiments showed that datapath merging without bit-alignment achieved an average area reduction of 10.1%.  With bit-alignment, an average of 16.5% was achieved.  Bit-alignment proved most beneficial when there was a diverse mix of different bit-widths in the datapaths.  Performance of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) used for floating-point applications is poor due to the complexity of floating-point arithmetic. Implementing floating-point units on FPGAs consume a large amount of resources. Therefore, there is a need for embedded FPUs in FPGAs.  However, if unutilized, they waste area on the FPGA die.  To overcome this issue, a novel flexible multi-mode embedded FPU for FPGAs is presented in this thesis that can be configured to perform a wide range of operations.  The floating-point adder and multiplier in the embedded FPU can each be configured to perform one double-precision operation or two single-precision operations in parallel.  To increase flexibility further, access to the large integer multiplier, adder and shifters in the FPU is provided.  It is also capable of floating-point and integer multiply-add operations.  Benchmark circuits were implemented on both a standard Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA and on the FPGA with embedded FPU blocks.  The implementations on the FPGA with embedded FPUs showed mean area and delay improvements of 5.2x and 5.8x respectively for the double-precision benchmarks, and 4.4x and 4.2x for the single-precision benchmarks.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">embedded systems</field><field name="subject">floating-point</field><field name="subject">FPGA</field><field name="subject">FPU</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44399</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The disutility of assessing trust beneficiaries on income derived by trustees: a critique of the existing regime whereunder beneficiaries are taxed on trust income before they receive it</field><field name="creator">Rankine, Campbell, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The Australian tax policy of assessing trusts and their beneficiaries has been buffeted by changes that have occurred over the last 10 years or so, chiefly in the rules that equity has adopted and applied in its restatement of the rights and interests that a beneficiary has in a trust.  Broadly, the scheme of div 6 of Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 ?? the general provisions for assessing trustees and beneficiaries ?? has remained largely unaltered, its machinery has now become ill-suited to equity??s new jurisprudence concerning beneficiaries' interests in trusts. This thesis examines the rules that seek to identify in a beneficiary an interest that she or he has in a trust??s subject matter, and it questions whether the tax legislation is still adequate to work its policies in the light of changes in the rules of equity.  Most pressing amongst them is the concept of present entitlement to income as a criterion for assessing beneficiaries of trusts on incomes derived by their trustees ?? at least before the income is physically paid or dealt with by the trustees so that there is some actual or constructive receipt by the beneficiary of that income. In addition to this, the thesis points to other difficulties that have arisen ?? largely because of changing jurisprudence ?? that portend the unworkability of the current tax policy.  The proposition is that the only way to correct the present and forthcoming problems, and the tensions they will cause in the Australian tax system, is to abandon the conventional policy of seeking primarily to assess a beneficiary on a mere present entitlement, and instead to assess tax on physical distributions.  Under this proposition, a beneficiary will no longer be assessed on anticipated distributions: she or he will now be assessed only on those distributions that are actually made thereto.  Naturally enough, a number of other trust assessing issues are affected by the proposal, and the changes to them ?? largely in a way that makes them simpler ?? are proposed and submitted.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Entity Tax</field><field name="subject">Trust Income</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a novel magnetic photocatalyst : preparation, characterisation and implication for organic degradation in aqueous systems</field><field name="creator">Beydoun, Donia, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Magnetic photocatalysts were synthesised by coating a magnetic core with a layer of photoactive titanium dioxide. This magnetic photocatalyst is for use in slurry-type reactors in which the catalyst can be easily recovered by the application of an external magnetic field. The first attempt at producing this magnetic photocatalyst involved the direct deposition of titanium dioxide onto the surface of magnetic iron oxide particles. The photoactivity of these Fe3O4/TiO2 was lower than that of single-phase TiO2 and was found to decrease with an increase in the heat treatment. These observations were explained in terms of an unfavourable heterojunction between the titanium dioxide and the iron oxide core. Fe ion diffusion from the iron oxide core into the titanium dioxide matrix upon heat treatment, leading to a highly doped TiO2 lattice, was also contributing to the observed low activities of these samples. These Fe3O4/TiO2 particles were found to be unstable, with photodissolution of the iron oxide phase being encountered. This photodissolution was dependent on the heat treatment applied, the greater the extent of the heat treatment, the lower the incidence of photodissolution. This was explained in terms of the stability of the iron oxide phases present, as well as the lower photoactivity of the titanium dioxide matrix. In fact, the observed photodissolution was found to be induced-photodissolution. That is, the photogenerated electrons in the titanium dioxide phase were being injected into the lower lying conduction band of the iron oxide core, leading to its reduction and then dissolution. Thus, the approach of directly depositing TiO2 onto the surface of a magnetic iron oxide core proved ineffective in producing a stable magnetic photocatalyst. The introduction of an intermediate passive SiO2 layer between the titanium dioxide phase and the iron oxide phase inhibited the direct electrical contact and hence prevented the photodissolution of the iron oxide phase. Improvements in the photoactivity were seen to be due to the inhibition of both the electronic and chemical interactions between the iron oxide and titanium dioxide phases. Preliminary optimisation experiments revealed that a thin SiO2 layer is sufficient for inhibiting the photodissolution. The thickness of the TiO2 coating was found not to have a significant effect on the photocatalytic performance of the coated particles. Finally, heat treating for 20 minutes at 450??C was sufficient for converting the titanium dioxide into a photoactive phase, longer heating times had no beneficial effect on the photoactivity.</field><field name="date">2000</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">magnetic photocatalyst</field><field name="subject">magnetic particles</field><field name="subject">magnetite</field><field name="subject">titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">water treatment</field><field name="subject">solid liquid separation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20451</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Novel uses of titanium dioxide for silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Richards, Bryce Sydney, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titanium dioxide (TiO2) thin films have a long history in silicon photovoltaics (PV) as antireflection (AR) coatings due to their excellent optical properties and low deposition cost. This work explores several novel areas where TiO2 thin films could be use to enhance silicon (Si) solar cell performance while reducing device fabrication costs. Amorphous, anatase and rutile TiO2 thin films are deposited using ultrasonic spraydeposition (USD) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) systems, both designed and constructed by the author. Initial experiments confirmed that no degradation in the bulk minority carrier lifetime (????bulk) occurred during high-temperature processing, although the stability of the USD-deposited TiO2 films was dependent on the furnace ambient. A major disadvantage of TiO2 AR coatings is that they afford little surface passivation. In this work, a novel method of achieving excellent surface passivation on TiO2-coated silicon wafers is presented. This involved growing a 6 nm-thick SiO2 layer at the TiO2:Si interface by oxidising the wafer after TiO2 film deposition. The increase in surface passivation afforded by the interfacial SiO2 layer results in a decrease in the emitter dark saturation current density (J0e) by nearly two orders of magnitude to 4.7 ??? 7.7 ??~ 10???14 A/cm2. This demonstrates the compatibility of the TiO2/SiO2 stack with high-efficiency solar cells designs. By varying the film deposition and annealing conditions, TiO2 refractive indices in the range of 1.726 ??? 2.633 (at ???? = 600 nm) could be achieved. Subsequently, a double-layer antireflection (DLAR) coating was designed comprised of low and high TiO2 refractive index material. The best experimental weighted average reflectance (Rw) achieved was 6.5% on a planar silicon wafer in air. TiO2 DLAR coatings are ideally suited to multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers, which do not respond well to chemical texturing. Modelling performed for a glass and ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) encapsulated buried-contact solar cell indicated that a TiO2 DLAR coating afforded a 7% increase in the short circuit current density, when compared to a standard, commercially-deposited TiO2 single-layer AR coating. Finally, it is demonstrated that chemical reactions with phosphorus prevent TiO2 from acting as a successful phosphorus diffusion barrier or dopant source. The applicability of TiO2 thin films to various silicon solar cell structures is discussed.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Solar cells</field><field name="subject">Design and construction</field><field name="subject">Titanium dioxide</field><field name="subject">Silicon oxide films</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20476</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Networks for regional development : case studies from Australia and Spain</field><field name="creator">Martinez-Fernandez, Cristina, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study investigates the role of regional networks for economic development (RENEDs) in regions suffering from industrial dislocation. It proposes that RENEDs significantly affect regional development. It also investigates the aspects of RENEDs that promote interorganisational collaboration on projects, and examines how RENEDs foster and manage them. The research uses a case study approach, and presents two regions suffering from the decline of their main economic source. These regions are the Hunter region of New South Wales (Australia) and the Le??n province of Castilla Y Le??n (Spain). A pilot study and a survey were conducted in both regions. Three types of analysis were applied: network, statistical and qualitative. The research method makes it possible to replicate research and develop a theory of regional networks for economic development. The results show that success of RENEDs is determined by capital investment generated by the projects, their influence in changing the economic bases of the regions, and the improvement to regional network capital. This study found that frequency of communication is a structural element that significantly affects the production of projects. However, other variables affect projects, such as external pressures from globalisation, government policies and ideologies, and internal constraints from the public, private and civic sectors. This thesis concludes that RENEDs have an important role in regional planning through the formulation of specific projects that target economic disparity. RENEDs represent a system of relationship that enrich the network capital of the regions as an important asset for their future.</field><field name="date">2001</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Regional planning</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Hunter River Region</field><field name="subject">Spain</field><field name="subject">Castilla y Le??n</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20482</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the demagnetisation process and possible alternative magnetic treatments for naval vessels</field><field name="creator">Baynes, Timothy Malcolm, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naval submarines and surface ships are regularly subjected to a treatment called &amp;quotdeperming&amp;quot that seeks to design the vessel???s permanent magnetisation for optimal magnetic camouflage. A scaled model of a magnetic treatment facility (MTF) has been established as a valid system to simulate deperming and used to investigate various aspects of the deperm process including: magnetic anisotropy and demagnetising fields as factors in the physical modelling of magnetism in whole vessels; a comparison of current and alternative deperm procedures; the application of theoretical models of bulk magnetisation to calculate deperm outcomes in the physical model and in actual vessels. A &amp;quotlaboratory MTF&amp;quot was constructed to imitate the applied field geometry at a naval MTF. The system was calibrated and it was determined that the laboratory MTF could make magnetic measurements on a CU200T-G steel bar sample with an equivalent accuracy (error = ??5%) to that of standard magnetometric equipment. Experiments were conducted with emphasis on a holistic approach to modelling the deperm process and describing magnetisation changes in whole objects. The importance of the magnetic anisotropic changes to steel with cold rolling was confirmed. In CU200T-G steel sheet the initial susceptibility (ci) was found to increase by a factor of 3 ??0.1 in the rolling direction, from a value of ~ 110 in the un-rolled steel sheet (thickness dependent). ci in the rolled sheet transverse to the rolling direction was decreased by a factor of 0.94 ??0.09 to ci in the un-rolled sheet steel. Previous studies on hull steel have neglected to account for this transformation through cold work. The demonstration on mild steel here is expected to have an analogy in the final state of the hull sheet steel as it resides in a submarine pressure hull. Future studies either on hull material or on modelling whole vessels should include the same or similar magnetic anisotropic properties in the steel(s) under investigation. Hollow circular tubes made from CA2S-E and CU200T-G steel sheet were selected as models for vessels. It was shown that these steel tubes were a good choice in this regard: minimising the complexity of the experiment whilst maintaining the validity of a deperm simulation. During a deperm there was an excellent qualitative likeness in the permanent longitudinal magnetisation (PLM) for the steel tubes to PLM in both a submarine and a surface vessel. Permanent vertical magnetisation (PVM) deperm results from the tubes displayed a close qualitative match with PVM in a submarine but not in a surface vessel. A theoretical treatment for demagnetisation factors (Nd) in hollow ellipsoids was used in conjunction with a geometrical approximation to calculate Nd for finite hollow objects of revolution. Subsequent theoretical calculations correlated well with experimental results for measured effective ci (ceff) in hollow circular CU200T-G steel tubes of various lengths and aspect ratios. Using an estimate of 100 as ci for submarine hull steel, the same analysis produces Nd for the axial and transaxial directions in a submarine equal to 5.97??10-3 and 0.0142 respectively. Three items for potential improvement were identified in the current deperm protocol used on naval vessels (Flash-D): redundancy in the protocol; the duration of the deperm and a theoretical basis for predicting the final magnetisation or changes in magnetisation during a deperm. Simulations of a novel &amp;quotanhysteretic deperm&amp;quot method, designed to combat these issues, compared favourably to the Flash-D protocol. The standard deviation (s) of the final PVM from 30 Flash-D deperms on steel tubes was 206 A/m; for the final PVM from 30 anhysteretic deperms of the same duration, this was 60 A/m. The s for the final PLM for Flash-D and anhysteretic deperms of the same duration were 416 A/m and 670 A/m respectively. The conclusion is that adopting the anhysteretic deperm on actual vessels would improve the reliability of the PVM outcome. Though the procedure would demand the same duration as Flash-D, there is the advantage of saving time by not having to repeat deperms to obtain the desired result. Additionally the anhysteretic deperm is considerably more amenable to theoretical analysis. A modified version of Langevin???s equation was used to predict the final PLM and PVM results for anhysteretic deperms and to provide a useful analysis of the anhysteretic processes in the Flash-D procedure. Using a Preisach analysis of hysteresis, a mathematical description of bulk magnetic changes that occur to a specific object, within a deperm, has been developed. Theoretical calculations of PLM in a steel tube during and after both types of deperm are in excellent agreement with experimental data. The same theoretical approach was also used to retrospectively model PLM results from previous Flash-D deperms on a submarine with equal success. With this analysis it is proposed that anhysteretic deperm outcomes could be predicted a priori. The influence of magnetic cargo on hull magnetisation was demonstrated to be of significance during and after deperming. &amp;quotSympathetic deperming&amp;quot occurs where a magnetic source is located close to the hull during a deperm. It was found that a vessel or model vessel hull could still be demagnetised even when they contain magnetic cargo that would normally resist the direct application of the same magnetic fields. This was explained using the principles of demagnetising fields and anhysteretic magnetisation. A possible explanation was provided for a PVM measurement anomaly common to the model and vessel deperm results. From measurement, alternating longitudinal applied fields apparently induce corresponding changes in the PVM. This effect could be explained by the depermed object being offset longitudinally from the position expected by the measurement system. This offset could be estimated using an analysis of the changes to PLM and PVM after a longitudinal applied field. The offset displacements calculated for the vessels were too small to be verified experimentally (&amp;gt 0.1m), but the predicted offset for the steel tubes coincided with the limit of precision for their placement in the laboratory MTF = 0.5mm The aim of this work was to look at the deperm process with reference to a system that demonstrated qualitative similarities to deperms on actual vessels. The laboratory MTF is a unique facility, permitting a useful practical analysis of deperming based on sound magnetostatic measurements The experimental and theoretical results gained here have direct application to future deperms on naval vessels with particular reference to submarines.</field><field name="date">2002</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Degaussing</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic devices</field><field name="subject">Magnetism of ships</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20479</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of estuarine acidification on survival and growth of the Sydney rock oyster Saccostrea glomerata</field><field name="creator">Dove, Michael Colin, Geography Program, UNSW</field><field name="description">Estuarine acidification, caused by disturbance of acid sulfate soils (ASS), is a recurrent problem in eastern Australia. Affected waters are characterised by low pH and elevated concentrations of metals, principally aluminium and iron. The effects of acid and elevated metal concentrations associated with ASS, on adult Sydney rock oysters, have not been previously investigated. This study tested links between ASS-affected drainage, subsequent estuarine acidification and Sydney rock oyster production problems on the Hastings and Manning Rivers, mid north coast New South Wales. The primary objective of this thesis was to establish if estuarine acidification causes mortality and slow growth in individual Sydney rock oysters by exposing oysters to low pH, iron and aluminium using field and laboratory experiments. Water quality data showed that estuarine acidification was spatially extensive in the Hastings and Manning Rivers following heavy rainfall and was due to mineral acids originating from drained or excavated ASS. Estuarine acidification regularly affected areas used for Sydney rock oyster production following heavy rainfall. Field experiments showed that Sydney rock oyster mortality rates were significantly higher at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters compared to locations that were isolated from ASS-affected waters. Oyster mortality increased with the time of exposure and smaller oysters (mean weight = 5 g) experienced significantly higher mortality relative to larger oysters (mean weight = 29 g). This was caused by acid-induced shell degradation resulting in perforation of the smaller oysters??? under-developed shells. Additionally, Sydney rock oyster growth rates were dramatically reduced at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters and the overall mean condition index of oysters at ASS-affected field sites was significantly lower than the overall mean condition index of oysters at non-impacted sites. Findings from laboratory experiments showed that ASS-affected water alters oyster valve movements and significantly reduces oyster feeding rates at pH 5.5. Acidic treatments (pH 5.1) containing 7.64 mg L-1 of aluminium or ASS-affected water caused changes in the mantle and gill soft tissues following short-term exposure. Degenerative effects described in oysters in this study were also due to iron contained in ASS-affected waters. Iron precipitates accumulated on the shell, gills and mantle and were observed in the stomach, intestine, digestive tubules and rectum. This study concluded that Sydney rock oysters are unable to tolerate acidic conditions caused by ASS outflows and cannot be viably cultivated in acid-prone areas of the estuary.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Saccostrea glomerata</field><field name="subject">Oysters</field><field name="subject">Effects of water pollution on</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney Region</field><field name="subject">Acid pollution of rivers</field><field name="subject">lakes</field><field name="subject">etc.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of environmental enrichment on fundamental cognitive processes in rats and humans</field><field name="creator">Woodcock, Elizabeth Ann, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examined whether it is possible to enhance core elements of the information processing system with specific forms of environmental stimulation.  The first series of experiments demonstrated that a preweaning environmental enrichment procedure that provided 60 minutes of daily multisensory stimulation accelerated the development of long-term contextual memory and enhanced inhibitory processing in young rats.  That is, whilst stimulated and non-stimulated rats exhibited long-term memory of a context at 26 days of age, only stimulated rats showed this ability at 18 days of age.  In addition, stimulated rats showed a faster rate of extinction of long-term contextual memory at 21 days of age, which was taken as evidence of enhanced inhibitory learning (i.e., context ??? no US) in these rats. Subsequent experiments with adult rats demonstrated that a combination of preweaning multisensory stimulation and postweaning rearing in an enriched environment improved the (1) specificity of long-term contextual memory, (2) speed of contextual information processing, and (3) availability of attentional resources.  More specifically, enriched-reared rats demonstrated superior ability to discriminate between two similar contexts in comparison to standard-reared rats.  In addition, enriched-reared rats showed superior memory of a context when there was limited time available to form a memory of that context.  This finding was taken to indicate that rats that receive environmental enrichment are able to process contextual information more rapidly.  Finally, standard-, but not enriched-, reared rats showed less conditioning to a discrete stimulus when it was presented in combination with a stronger stimulus during training compared to when it was presented by itself.  The finding that enriched-reared rats did not show this overshadowing effect suggests that these rats have greater availability of attentional resources to divide between two stimuli that are competing for attention. The experiments with rats were followed by two experiments with children that investigated the effects of a computerised cognitive training procedure on information-processing speed.  These experiments demonstrated that 30-minutes per weekday of training in rapid decision-making for three to five weeks improved children???s performance on two tests of processing speed (i.e., a choice reaction time and odd-man-out task).  In addition, the speeded training improved children???s ability to sustain their attention and inhibit impulsive responses on a continuous performance test (Test of Variables of Attention).  The cognitive training procedure had no effect on children???s performance on a measure of fluid intelligence (Raven???s Standard Progressive Matrices). The results of the experiments reported in this thesis suggest that a number of fundamental cognitive processes can be modified by environmental conditions that place increasing demands on the information-processing system.  A neurobiological model, focusing on myelin, axon diameter, and the glutamatergic, glucocorticoid, noradrenergic, and cholinergic systems, was proposed in order to explain the observed effects of environmental stimulation on cognition in children and rats. The rationale for attempting to enhance fundamental cognitive processes was that improving these processes should ultimately improve general intellectual functioning.  With respect to this aim, the correlational data from the present experiments with children revealed promising trends towards greater improvements on the tests of fundamental cognitive processes in those children in the training group with slower processing speed at the start of the intervention.  This finding suggests that cognitive training may be even more effective at enhancing processing speed and other fundamental cognitive processes in children with intellectual impairments???who reportedly have slower processing speed than normal children.  However, the extent to which training-related improvements in fundamental cognitive processes generalise to improvements in general cognitive functioning is unclear.  That is, there is insufficient evidence that processing speed and other fundamental cognitive processes are causally related to intelligence.  It is therefore essential that future cognitive training research is mindful of related developments within the intelligence and information processing literature.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Environmental enrichment</field><field name="subject">enriched environment</field><field name="subject">early experience</field><field name="subject">early stimulation</field><field name="subject">fundamental cognitive processes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20488</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A cognitive load approach to instruction in formation of algebraic equations</field><field name="creator">Pawley, Duncan Medway, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In a series of five experiments, the effectiveness of using worked examples to teach grade 8 and 9 students the process of translating a written sentence into an algebraic equation, was examined from a cognitive load perspective. The first experiment compared the use of worked examples with a problemsolving strategy. Both for higher and lower levels of prior knowledge in mathematics, the worked examples format group performed significantly better than the problemsolving group. In experiment 2 the worked examples format was compared with an ??algorithm?? method for teaching students to write equations. No significant differences were found in performance on similar questions at either the higher or the lower levels of prior knowledge. However, for transfer questions and questions testing understanding, the performance of the worked examples format was significantly better than that of the algorithm format for the higher level of prior knowledge, though differences were not significant for the lower level. In experiment 3 worked examples using two different methods of checking the translation, the ??comparison?? method and the ??substitution?? method, were compared. No significant differences were found between the two methods for either knowledge group. In experiments 4 and 5 it was shown that grade 8 and 9 students were initially disadvantaged by the inclusion of a checking method. However, after a more substantial period of acquisition, for the students with a lower level of prior knowledge, those who received checking instructions performed significantly better than did those who did not receive such instructions. In contrast, higher knowledge students were continually disadvantaged by the inclusion of a checking method. Higher knowledge students receiving checking instructions experienced a significantly higher cognitive load than did those not receiving them, as shown by a measure of mental effort. The positive effect of checking for lower knowledge students and the negative effect for higher knowledge students in this domain is a further example of the expertise reversal effect. Evidence was found that the inclusion of checking instructions led to a redundancy effect for higher knowledge learners and caused retroactive inhibition for all learners.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Equations</field><field name="subject">Study and teaching (Secondary)</field><field name="subject">Cognitive learning theory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20494</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The production of indigenous knowledge in intellectual property law</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Jane Elizabeth, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is an exploration of how indigenous knowledge has emerged as a subject within Australian intellectual property law. It uses the context of copyright law to illustrate this development. The work presents an analysis of the political, social and cultural intersections that influence legal possibilities and effect practical expectations of the law in this area.  The dilemma of protecting indigenous knowledge resonates with tensions that characterise intellectual property as a whole. The metaphysical dimensions of intellectual property have always been insecure but these difficulties come to the fore with the identification of boundaries and markers that establish property in indigenous subject matter. While intellectual property law is always managing difference, the politics of law are more transparent when managing indigenous concerns. Rather than assume the naturalness of the category of indigenous knowledge within law, this work interrogates the politics of its construction precisely as a ???special??? category. Employing a multidisciplinary methodology, engaging theories of governmental rationality that draws upon the scholarship of Michel Foucault to appreciate strategies of managing and directing knowledge, the thesis considers how the politics of law is infused by cultural, political, bureaucratic and individual factors. Key elements in Australia that have pushed the law to consider expressions of indigenous knowledge in intellectual property can be located in changing political environments, governmental intervention through strategic reports, cultural sensitivity articulated in case law and innovative instances of individual agency. The intersection of these elements reveals a dynamic that exerts influence in the shape the law takes.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intellectual property</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Copyright</field><field name="subject">Moral rights</field><field name="subject">Art</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian</field><field name="subject">Cultural property</field><field name="subject">Protection</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples</field><field name="subject">Legal status</field><field name="subject">laws</field><field name="subject">etc.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20491</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Myo1c phosphorylation in GLUT4 translocation</field><field name="creator">Yip, Ming Fai Freddy, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Glucose is a primary and essential energy source for humans. It is broken down from complex carbohydrates in the diet and absorbed across the gut epithelium into the blood stream. Glucose homeostasis is important as hyperglycermia causes damage of pancreatic and peripheral cells. In response to a meal glucose is principally taken up by fat and muscle tissues and this response is activated by insulin release from pancreatic beta cells. Insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 from the intracellular storage vesicles to the plasma membrane in fat and muscle cells. Although many proteins have been implicated in this process, the key insulin-regulated substrate has not been determined yet. In the present study, the phosphoserine/threonine binding protein 14-3-3 was used as a tool to affinity-purify insulin-stimulated phosphoproteins from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. By using mass spectrometry 38 proteins were identified, reflecting the important role of 14-3-3 in mediating many insulin-regulated processes. Among the potential phosphoproteins was Myosin 1C (Myo1c), an actin-associated molecular motor, which has previously been implicated in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes. I showed that insulin stimulates the activation of CaMKII which phosphorylates Myo1c at S701 in a Ca2+/PI3K-dependent manner. Myo1c phosphorylation induced its interaction with 14-3-3-proteins, reduced calmodulin-binding and stimulated its in vitro ATPase activity. Insulin-dependent stimulation of Myo1c phosphorylation and its ATPase activity were both required for GLUT4 translocation. By using yeast two-hybrid techniques, I identified a candidate ligand of the Myo1c tail, Armcx5, and demonstrated the in vivo interaction in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of Armcx5 inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation. These results suggest that the regulation of Myo1c and its ligand Armcx5 are essential in insulin-regulated GLUT4 trafficking, possibly playing a key role in vesicle fusion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">glucose metabolism</field><field name="subject">molecular motor</field><field name="subject">calcium signaling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43648</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Constant speed flows and the nonlinear Schr??dinger equation</field><field name="creator">Grice, Glenn Noel, Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis demonstrates how the geometric connection between the integrable Heisenberg spin equation, the nonlinear Schr??dinger equation and fluid flows with constant velocity magnitude along individual streamlines may be exploited.

The three inflammation-associated members of this family???S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 (collectively termed &amp;quotcalgranulins&amp;quot)???are constitutive neutrophil and monocyte proteins also expressed by macrophages within acute and chronic inflammatory lesions, but not in tissue macrophages. They are expressed in human/murine wounds and by appropriately activated macrophages, microvascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes in vitro. The &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot are implicated in leukocyte activation/deactivation, fatty acid transport, leukocyte/fibroblast chemotaxis, transmigration and adhesion, embryogenesis, wound healing, protection against oxidants and antibacterial defence. Chapter 3 of this thesis explores growth-factor- and cytokine-mediated regulation and expression of S100A8 and S100A9 in fibroblasts, and demonstrates spatio-temporal expression of S100A8 in rat dermal wounds. Fibroblasts are stromal resident cells with important regulatory immune-inflammatory functions in wound healing, tissue remodelling and fibrosis. Fibroblast migration, proliferation, differentiation and their synthetic repertoire are modulated by various factors including extracellular matrix components, growth factors, prostaglandins, reactive oxygen species and cytokines. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), interleukin-1?(IL-1? and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) are potent fibroblast mitogens; PDGF and transforming growth factor-? (TGF-? are fibroblast chemoattractants. FGF-2 and IL-1?promote fibroblast proliferation, whereas TGF-?promotes myofibroblast differentiation and collagen production. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon ?(IFN?, tumour-necrosis factor ? (TNF?, TGF-?and PDGF did not induce the S100A8 gene in fibroblasts whereas FGF-2 (25 ng/ml) maximally induced mRNA 12 hr. after stimulation and this declined over 36 hr. The FGF-2 response was strongly enhanced and prolonged by optimal levels of heparin (1-10 IU/ml), maximally at 18 hr. post-stimulation. FGF-2/heparin-induced responses depended on cell-cell contact in vitro. IL-1?(10 U/ml) alone, or in synergy with FGF-2/heparin strongly induced the gene in 3T3 and primary fibroblasts. Dexamethasone (10???6 M) enhanced LPS- and FGF-2/-IL-1?induced responses. S100A9 mRNA was not induced by any of these mediators. Induction of S100A8 in the absence of S100A9 was confirmed in primary fibroblast-like cells by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain-reaction. FGF-2-heparin- and IL-1?induced mRNA expression depended on de-novo protein synthesis and was partially mediated by the mitogenactivated protein kinase pathway of activation. Preliminary promoter deletion analyses indicated that FGF-2-responsive elements in the gene promoter were distinct from those responsive to IL-1? TGF-?(2 ng/ml) significantly suppressed gene induction mediated by FGF-2 ?heparin/LPS/dexamethasone, but not by IL-1? TGF-?may compromise mRNA stability. Protein levels in FGF-2-heparin-IL-1?stimulated fibroblasts correlated well with mRNA levels and expression was mainly cytoplasmic. Immunohistochemistry indicated S100A8 associated with keratinocytes, neutrophils, macrophage-like cells and some hair follicles in wounded rat skin. Rat wounds also contained numerous S100A8- positive fibroblast-like cells 2 and 4 days post-injury; numbers declined by 7 days. Upregulation of S100A8 by FGF-2/IL-1? down-regulation by TGF-? and time-dependent expression of S100A8 in wound fibroblasts suggest a role in fibroblast differentiation at sites of inflammation and repair. Intracellular fibroblast-derived S100A8 may also regulate intracellular redox equilibrium and antioxidant defence. Atherosclerosis is a progressive chronic disease with complex aetiology and pathogenesis. S100A1 and S100B are associated with dendritic cells and lymphocytes in experimental rodent and human atherosclerotic lesions. Monocytes and macrophages in plaques of ApoE???/??? mice express S100A9 but not S100A8. Myeloperoxidase and HOClmediated oxidative mechanisms are fundamental in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and S100A8 is exquisitely sensitive to HOCl oxidation which generates sulphinamide bonds, novel non-reducible cysteine-lysine covalent bonds. Chapter 4 of this thesis presents novel evidence that, in contrast to the murine ApoE???/??? model, the three human &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot were expressed in human atherosclerotic plaques, but not in normal arteries. High levels of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were evident in macrophages and foam cells. Some neovessels were anti-S100A8-/anti-S100A9-immunoreactive; S100A9 staining was also evident on the extracellular matrix. Patterns of expression of S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 were overlapping in serial sections, except that only smooth muscle cells were S100A12-positive. S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA were also expressed by macrophages, foam cells and endothelial cells, indicating gene up-regulation rather than passive protein uptake. Western blotting of plaque extracts revealed monomeric S100A8, S100A9 and S100A12 and larger complexes. Some were resistant to reduction, suggesting non-disulfide covalent cross-linking, possibly via sulphinamide bonds. Stable S100A8-S100A9 complexes were also detected after immunoaffinity purification. In an in-vitro system, molar ratios of HOCl of &amp;gt1 generated stable complexes of S100A8 and S100A9 whereas ~800 and ~100-fold excess HOCl oxidises apolipoprotein B-100 and BSA, respectively. S100A8 and S100A9 protected low-density lipoprotein (LDL) against HOCl oxidation in a thiol-independent manner. Because HOCl-oxidised S100s did not contain epitopes recognised by an antibody used to detect HOCl-oxidised proteins in plaque, levels of oxidised proteins in plaque are likely to be significantly greater than described. S100A8 and S100A9 may protect LDL by functioning as HOCl-scavengers. However, chronic oxidative cross-linking of S100A8 and S100A9 with other proteins and extracellular matrix components may contribute to plaque pathogenesis. These studies support key roles for the &amp;quot calgranulins&amp;quot in chronic inflammation, wound healing and atherogenesis possibly by regulating cellular differentiation, activation and modulation of redox-dependent mechanisms.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Atherosclerosis</field><field name="subject">Fibroblasts</field><field name="subject">Calcium-binding proteins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">How can teachers best enable adult English language learners to interact verbally?</field><field name="creator">Evans, Simone Kirsten, School of Modern Languages, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study revolves around the delivery of an ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) program on conflict management in the workplace to a small group of adult learners studying in a private educational institution in Sydney, Australia. The program was of four days???? duration, and was delivered over a four-week period. It involved both in-class and out-of-class tasks, and required learners to analyse their own discourse practices, those of other learners, and those of the speech community in which they were living. The program had two principle objectives. Firstly, it asked whether learners are able to modify their discourse practices at will in order to achieve successful negotiation outcomes. Secondly, it explored the effect of deliberately altered discourse styles on perceptions of learners held by speech community members. The methodology employed to achieve these objectives was ethnographic in nature and involved the following processes: 1. Learners were video-taped negotiating with other learners before and after the program. 2. Learners undertook the program aimed at increasing their ability to negotiate in business environments using culturally appropriate spoken language in conjunction with compatible prosodic and paralinguistic features as well as conversation management strategies. Learners kept diaries of their experiences and self-evaluation, and were interviewed following the course. 3. A group of nine native speakers of English viewed the 'before' and 'after' video-tapes and completed a survey aimed at collecting and quantitatively measuring (change in) their perceptions of the learners. This change was statistically analysed using a repeated-measures t test. The effect proved statistically significant overall; t(80) = 1.990, p&amp;gt.01, two-tailed. 4. The 'before' and 'after' negotiations were then analysed by the researcher using ethnomethodological Conversation Analysis, modified to include some aspects of facial expression. The implications of the findings for teaching 'Business English', 'Global English' and 'Speaking' more generally are then discussed.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">English language--Study and teaching--Australia</field><field name="subject">English language--Business English</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Police misconduct, regulation, and accountability : conflict of interest complaints against Victoria Police officers 1988???1998</field><field name="creator">Davids, Cindy, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conflict of interest allegations became a prominent part of the political and public sector in the 1980s and 1990s in Australia and elsewhere. The arena of policing was not immune, and in Victoria, the Ombudsman drew particular attention to the problem and expressed concern about the rise in public complaints relating to alleged conflicts of interest on the part of police officers. Against this background, permission was granted by Victoria Police for a major study of conflict of interest complaints against police officers within their jurisdiction. Access was granted to all public complaint case files where conflict of interest was the focus of the allegations, from the period 1988???1998. A total of 377 usable complaints files were examined, involving 539 police officers. Through extensive examination and analysis of these complaint case files, a comprehensive map of the particular kinds of interest involved, the nature of the conflicts with official police duties, and the particular contexts within which conflicts of interest emerged, was developed. Analysis of the case files identified 25 different types of problems related to conflict of interest. These were spread across the private and public realms of police officers??? involvements. Previous studies of conflict of interest have focused largely on the opportunities for misconduct arising in the public realm of police work and police duty, largely neglecting attention to the private realm of the relationships and involvements of a police officer that give rise to conflicts of interest. In this study, the specific private interests that gave rise to problems were able to be identified in 35 percent of all cases. Three broad problem areas were identified: (i) outside employment, private business interests, political, social, and sporting interests and involvements; (ii) family-based involvements, especially those involving family law problems; and (iii) problematic personal relationships, including relationships with criminals, informers, and persons of ill repute. These conflicts of interest were related to a range of breaches of official police duty, including the misuse of police authority for personal or family benefit, the use of police position to facilitate personal relationships, and inappropriate disclosure of confidential police information. When the conflict of interest identified related specifically to a police officer???s official or public role as a member of the police force, the main types of misconduct identified included three broad areas: (i) the use and abuse of police powers and authority; (ii) the use and abuse of police resources, including information; and (iii) the receipt of gratuities and breaches of the law. These problems were shown to play out in a range of ways, encompassing such behaviours as misuse of the police identity, inappropriate accessing of police information, involvement in investigations where the police officer concerned has a personal interest in the matter, failing to take appropriate police action against friends, family, or associates, the exercise of improper influence in civil matters, and engagement in harassment and discrimination. This study offers some important conceptual developments in relation to the notion of conflict of interest, focusing on the importance of the distinction between a conflict of interest and an associated breach of duty. The study noted that it is often erroneously assumed by police that if there is no breach of duty evidenced, then there is no problem of conflict of interest. The study also offers an important insight into the oversight and accountability processes involved in Victoria Police, emphasising the importance and effectiveness of the oversight role of the office of the Victorian Ombudsman. Evidence also suggests that the internal review processes within Victoria Police are by-and-large stringent, and that senior police management are genuinely interested in making police officers more accountable for their actions. However, it is concluded that both front-line operational police officer and police management often have a limited understanding of conflict of interest, and problems attendant to conflicts of interest. The study???s insights into the problem of conflict of interest are significant insofar as this problem is related to police misconduct???ranging from minor to serious???of various kinds. Attention to the problem of conflict of interest may be an important element in preventing ???upstream??? police misconduct and corruption.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Victoria Police</field><field name="subject">corrupt practices</field><field name="subject">complaints against</field><field name="subject">police misconduct</field><field name="subject">conflict of interests</field><field name="subject">police corruption</field><field name="subject">police power</field><field name="subject">police administration</field><field name="subject">Victoria</field><field name="subject">Police</field><field name="subject">conflict of interest</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of iron chelators as anti-proliferative agents against cancer : molecular mechanisms behind the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis</field><field name="creator">Le, Nghia Trung Van, School of Women???s &amp; Children???s Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron (Fe) is a fundamental requirement for life since it is involved in many cellular processes critical for growth and proliferation. Indeed, studies which deplete Fe from neoplastic cells using specific chelating agents result in G1/S arrest and apoptosis. However, the precise role of Fe in the control of the cell cycle remains unclear. Chapter one of this thesis, discusses the potential mechanism(s) by which Fe chelators cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that this process involves multiple molecules and is highly complex. Thus, the studies presented in this thesis assess the effects of specific high affinity Fe chelators on the expression of molecules that may play important roles in cellular arrest and apoptosis. The general methodology used in these studies is summarized in chapter 2. In previous investigations Fe chelators such as 2-hydroxy-1-naphthylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (311) were shown to be far more potent anti-tumor agents than the clinically used ligand, desferrioxamine (DFO). Studies detailed in chapter 3, examined the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53 and the universal cyclindependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 following Fe-deprivation. To further characterize the effects of chelators on cell cycle arrest, experiments compared their activity to the DNA-damaging agents, actinomycin D (Act D) and cisplatin (CP). The latter two compounds increase the expression of p53 and its target gene p21CIP1/WAF1. Incubation of normal and neoplastic cells with all agents resulted in increased accumulation of nuclear p53, with the effect being more pronounced for Act D and CP. As expected, both Act D and CP markedly increased nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels, while DFO and 311 caused a significant (p &amp;lt 0.0004) decrease. This result was surprising, since the WAF1 gene which encodes the universal cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1 was markedly up-regulated at the mRNA level following Fe chelation. Proteasomal inhibition studies demonstrated the partial involvement of proteasomes in decreasing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 levels following DFO treatment. In contrast, the incubation of 311-treated cells with proteasomal inhibitors did not reverse the down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 when compared to the control. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that only DNA-damaging agents and not Fe chelators increased the nuclear translocation of p21CIP1/WAF1. Collectively, this suggests that the chelators prevented translation of WAF1. Moreover, this decrease in nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein expression did not appear to be due to a general effect in which Fe chelators inhibited mRNA translation since the transferrin receptor 1 was markedly up-regulated (15-21- fold) by DFO or 311. The combination of 311 with Act D or CP prevented the marked p21CIP1/WAF1 nuclear accumulation normally observed in response to these DNAdamaging agents. Significantly, the effect of chelation on reducing nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 expression was reversed by the Fe-donor, ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), indicating that WAF1 translation was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. This study is the first to demonstrate that Fe chelators markedly up-regulate the mRNA expression of WAF1 but paradoxically inhibit its translation. The down-regulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 protein by chelators may be a novel mechanism by which these ligands cause G1/S arrest through cell cycle dysregulation. In chapter 4, gene arrays were used to assess the expression of molecules associated with cell cycle control and the p53 pathway following the incubation of cells with DFO, 311 or Act D. The N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (Ndrg1) was the only molecule identified that was specifically up-regulated by Fe chelation and not DNA-damage. Although the exact function of the Ndrg1 protein is unclear, previous studies have shown that this molecule markedly slows down tumor growth (Kurdistani et al. Cancer Res. 1998:58;4439-44) and acts as a potent metastasis suppressor protein (Bandyopadhyay et al. Cancer Res. 2003:63;1731-6). Subsequent experiments examined the mRNA and protein expression of Ndrg1 using reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blot analysis, respectively. Incubation of cells with DFO or 311 resulted in a marked increase in the expression of Ndrg1 mRNA and protein within 3 h and 6 h, respectively. This increase in Ndrg1 after incubation with chelators was not found with their Fe complexes nor when the Fe-binding site had been synthetically inactivated. In addition, the induction of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was correlated with the ligands??? permeability and anti-proliferative activity. Indeed, the up-regulation of Ndrg1 by Fe chelators can be readily reversed by Fe-repletion. Collectively, this indicates that the induction of Ndrg1 was dependent on intracellular Fe levels. Previous studies demonstrated for the first time that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was dependent on HIF-1?? and p53 stabilization. In contrast, investigations using fibroblasts derived from a HIF-1?? knockout (HIF-1??-KO) mouse demonstrated that the transcriptional upregulation of Ndrg1 following Fe chelation was mediated by a HIF-1??-dependent and - independent mechanism. In addition, subsequent experiments using the p53-deficient H1299 lung carcinoma cell line revealed that the transactivation of Ndrg1 was not dependent on p53 status after Fe-depletion. Collectively, the presented studies suggest that Ndrg1 may be a novel link between Fe metabolism and the control of proliferation. The up-regulation of Ndrg1 by potent Fe chelators is significant and may be beneficial in the prevention of tumor metastasis. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that the molecular mechanisms behind the G1/S arrest and apoptosis involved multiple molecules following Fe chelation. Indeed, this study shows a potential mechanism by which Fe chelators may cause cell cycle dysregulation through the down-regulation of nuclear p21CIP1/WAF1 protein levels. In addition, the work presented identifies the up-regulation of the metastasis suppressor protein, Ndrg1, following Fe-deprivation. Collectively, the results indicate that potent Fe chelators can not only be used as anti-proliferative agents, but may also be beneficial at inhibiting tumor cell metastasis.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Treatment</field><field name="subject">Iron chelates</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mechanisms of composite fouling in Australian sugar mill evaporators by calcium oxalate and amorphous silica</field><field name="creator">Yu, Hong, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Deposition of amorphous silica (SiO2) and calcium oxalate (CaOx) on the calandria tubes of juice evaporators cause serious processing problems in Australian cane sugar mills. The removal of these deposits by mechanical and chemical means is a timeconsuming and costly experience. The cost of downtime and chemical cleaning can be several million dollars per year for the Australian sugar industry. The interactions between CaOx and SiO2 have not been investigated previously because conventional studies only address fouling by individual components. The present work evaluates their interactions using two experimental approaches: batch tests for assessing kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour, and fouling-loop experiments for examining composite fouling behaviour under different operating conditions. The above two approaches were employed both in the absence and in the presence of sugar to elucidate the effect of sugar on composite fouling mechanisms and to determine the controlling species responsible for composite fouling. The composite fouling experiments were performed in a novel closed-loop circulation system simulating the effect of feed composition of successive stages of evaporation cycle in a single run. In addition, the fouling-loop system was operated in a constant composition mode to study the effects of thermal hydraulic conditions on composite fouling. The combined information obtained from both the batch and fouling-loop tests in this study offer a unique insight into the mechanisms of composite fouling of CaOx and SiO2. Some of the highlights of the obtained results are as follows: ??? Identification of a complex interactive process in calcium oxalate monohydrate ??? silica (COM-SiO2) systems by investigation of the kinetics and thermodynamics of COM-SiO2 coprecipitation in water and sugar solutions, and an understanding of the mechanisms of these interactions; ??? Development of a novel fouling-loop system, which is simple, efficient and cost effective for the study of the effect of juice composition on scale formation in various stages of juice evaporation; ??? Elucidation of composite fouling mechanisms, e.g., a feed composition dependent fouling mechanism is proposed; ??? Isolation and verification of the existence of certain species in composite deposits, which is known to be thermodynamically unstable. In other words, it is established that calcium oxalate trihydrate is stable under certain conditions; ??? Evaluation of the role of thermal hydraulic operating parameters in determining the characteristics of subcooled flow boiling heat transfer and in determining the strength of the composite deposit; ??? Development and validation of an empirical model to predict the subcooled flow boiling heat transfer coefficients in water and sugar solutions; ??? Development of an analytical model incorporating the effects of operating parameters for COM and SiO2 composite fouling in sugar solutions. This model predicted the experimental data better than available models. Results of this work are significant, not only because they have made a valuable contribution to advance the fundamental understanding of heat exchanger fouling, but also because they may play a key role in the development of scale control and removal strategies to minimize the composite fouling in Australian sugar mill evaporators. For example it was found that, in order to effectively minimize the rate of composite fouling and reduce the scale tenacity, it would be necessary to control thermal hydraulic operating conditions, especially the fluid velocity, and to adjust the initial CaOx/SiO2 supersaturation ratio to the optimum value. To achieve the optimal CaOx/SiO2 ratio, certain device can be developed to sequentially measure oxalic acid and SiO2 concentrations in juice so that the correct proportions of chemicals can be added. Model simulations of the composite fouling rate may also effectively and economically provide comparative and relevant information essential for process optimisation and evaporator design</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calcium oxalate</field><field name="subject">Sugar</field><field name="subject">Manufacture and refining</field><field name="subject">Silica</field><field name="subject">Fouling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20527</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Single-electron transistors for detection of charge motion in the solid state</field><field name="creator">Brenner, Rolf, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work investigates advanced single-electron transistor (SET) devices for detection of charge motion in solid-state systems. In particular, novel, nanoscale twin-SET and double-island SET (DISET) detectors are introduced as sensitive charge detectors. Some advantages over conventional SET detectors in terms of noise performance, sensitivity and versatility are pointed out. With the prospect of present, transistor-based microelectronics facing serious limitations due to quantum effects and heat dissipation, alternative computing paradigms ??? such as quantum computers, quantum-dot cellular automata and single-electronics ??? have emerged, promising an extension of highlevel integration and computing power beyond the above limitations. The most promising proposals are based on solid-state systems, and readout of a computational result often requires ultra-sensitive charge detectors capable of sensing the motion of single charges on fast timescales. SETs have been shown to combine all these qualities. However, random fluctuations of the background charge in solid-state systems can affect SETs and cause errors during readout. A twin-SET detector is presented that consists of two independent SETs, which were used to detect controlled single electron transfers on a small, floating metal double-dot. By cross-correlating the two SET signals, rejection of random charge noise is successfully demonstrated, thus decreasing the error probability during readout. Detection of single-electron transfer in a double-dot is also demonstrated using a double-island SET. In addition, conductance suppression in this novel DISET detector allows the detection of electrostatically degenerate charge con- figurations of a double-dot, which cannot be achieved with single-island SETs. We consider the noise performance of the DISET, and an intuitive definition of the DISET charge sensitivity suggests that under certain conditions, DISETs can have a better charge sensitivity than conventional SETs, which would be attractive for quantum limited measurements. Finally we present the first study of a DISET operated at radio-frequencies (rf-DISET), compatible with charge detection on ms timescales. This capability is a prerequisite when reading out the charge state of quantum mechanical systems. A very good charge sensitivity (5.6 x 10i6 e/pHz) and noise temperature (2.1 K) of the rf-DISET setup are reported.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transistors</field><field name="subject">Detectors</field><field name="subject">Solid state physics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20533</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of personal strengths and moral reasoning in gifted adolescents</field><field name="creator">O???Leary, Kay, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study was designed to investigate the attitudes of academically gifted adolescents towards the development of their personal strengths or gifts and to compare these with the attitudes of age peers not identified as gifted. This study also examined the reported higher levels of moral reasoning in gifted adolescents compared to age peers and how this may relate to their development of academic potential. The 750 participants included 401 identified gifted students and 349 students not identified as gifted in Years 9, 10 and 11 from seven different high schools in the Sydney Metropolitan region. An instrument entitled the Development of Personal Strengths Questionnaire was developed to analyse students??? attitudes while the Defining Issues Test (Rest, 1986) was also administered to measure moral reasoning ability. Results showed that gifted students have significantly higher levels of acknowledgement of personal strengths and reasons for developing personal strengths, which reflect altruistic motivations. Gifted students scored significantly higher on altruism and philanthropy and showed significantly higher scores on the Defining Issues Test. Aspects of developing personal strengths, on which gifted students showed no significant difference from non-identified peers were in areas of motivation and responsibility for developing these strengths. A significant, but modest, connection was found between development of personal strengths and moral reasoning. Gender differences were also examined, with males reporting higher acknowledgement of personal strengths than females and females reporting higher levels on reasons for developing personal strengths as well as altruism and philanthropy. Females also showed significantly higher scores on the Defining Issues Test. These results were consistent within the gifted participant group. It was concluded that gifted students in this study were more likely to acknowledge their personal strengths or gifts and were more inclined to hold reasons for this development which related to higher levels of altruism, philanthropy and moral reasoning. These characteristics need to be taken into consideration in development of programs and provisions for gifted students, both now and in the future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gifted children</field><field name="subject">adolescence.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20540</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Petroleum geology of the Gunnedah-Bowen-Surat Basins, Northern New South Wales : stratigraphy, organic petrology and organic geochemistry</field><field name="creator">Othman, Rushdy, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The three-dimensional thermal maturity pattern has been investigated and the hydrocarbon generation potential assessed for the Permian and Triassic sequences of the southern Bowen and northern Gunnedah Basins and the lower part of the overlying Jurassic Cretaceous Surat Basin sequence in northern New South Wales. An oil-source rock correlation also has been investigated in the Gunnedah Basin. Vitrinite reflectance measurements were conducted on 256 samples from 28 boreholes. A total of 50 of these samples were subjected to Rock-Eval pyrolysis analysis, and 28 samples extracted for additional organic geochemical studies (GCMS). A re-evaluation of the stratigraphy in the southern Bowen Basin and a stratigraphic correlation between that area and the northern Gunnedah Basin was also included in the study.  An overpressured shaly interval has been identified as a marker bed within the lower parts of the Triassic Moolayember and Napperby Formations, in the Bowen and Gunnedah Basins respectively. Suppressed vitrinite reflectance in the Permian sequence was used as another marker for mapping the stratigraphic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin. The Permian sequence in the Bowen Basin thins to the south, and probably pinches out over the Moree High and also to the west. The coal-bearing Kianga Formation is present in the north and northeastern parts of the study area. A disconformity surface between Digby and Napperby Formations in the Gunnedah Basin is probably time-equivalent to deposition of the Clematis Group and Showgrounds Sandstone in the Bowen Basin. The Clematis Group is absent in the study area, and the Moolayember Formation considered equivalent to the Napperby Formation.  Although in many cases core samples were not available, handpicking of coal or shaly materials from cuttings samples where geophysical log signatures identify these materials helped in reducing contamination from caved debris. Histogram plots of reflectance also helped where the target and caved debris were of similar lithology. Vertical profiles of the vitrinite reflectance identified suppressed intervals in the study area due to marine influence (Back Creek Group and Maules Creek Formation) and liptinite rich source organic matter (Goonbri Formation). The suppression occurs due to the perhydrous character of the preserved organic matter. High reflectance values were noted within intrusion-affected intervals, and two types of igneous intrusion profiles were identified; these are simple and complex profiles. An isoreflectance map for the non-suppressed interval at the base of the Triassic sequence in the southern Bowen Basin shows that the organic matter is mature more towards the east close to the Goondiwindi Fault, and also towards the west where the Triassic sequence directly overlies the basement. High values also occur over the Gil Gil Ridge in the middle, to the south over the Moree High, and to the north where the sequence is thicker. The reflectance gradient in the suppressed intervals is higher than in the overlying non-suppressed sequences, especially when the rank has resulted from burial depth.  Tmax from Rock-Eval pyrolysis was found to be lower in the perhydrous intervals, and was high in mature and igneous intrusion-affected intervals. Based on the source potential parameters, the Permian Back Creek Group is a better source than the Kianga Formation, while the Goonbri Formation is better than the Maules Creek Formation. The Triassic Napperby Formation has a fair capacity to generate oil, and is considered a better source rock than the equivalent Moolayember Formation. The Jurassic Walloon Coal Measures is a better source than Evergreen Formation, and has the best source rock characteristics, but is immature. The Rock-Eval S1 value shows better correlation with extracted hydrocarbon compounds (saturated and aromatics) than the total extractable organic matter. This suggests that solvent extraction has a greater ability to extract NSO compounds than temperature distillation over the Rock-Eval S1 interval. Terrestrial organic matter is the main source input for the sequences studied. This has been identified from organic petrology and from the n-alkane distributions and the relatively high C29 steranes and low sterane/hopane ratios. The absence of marine biomarker signatures in the Permian marine influenced sequence, could be attributed to their dilution by overwhelming amounts of non-marine organic matter. A mainly oxic to suboxic depositional environment is inferred from trace amounts of 25-NH, BNH and TNH. This is further supported by relatively high pr/ph ratios. Although C29/C30 is generally regarded as an environmental indicator, high values were noted in intrusion-affected samples. The 22S and 20S ratios were inverted ????reaches pseudo-equilibrium???? in such rapidly heated, high maturity samples. The ratio of C24 tetracyclic terpane to C21-C26 tricyclic terpanes decreases, instead of increasing, within the Napperby Formation close to a major igneous intrusive body. The 22S ratio, which is faster in reaction than the other terpane and sterane maturity parameters, shows that the Permian sequence lies within the oil generation stage in the Bowen Basin, except for a Kianga Formation sample. The Triassic sequence is marginally mature, and the Jurassic sequence is considered immature. In the Gunnedah Basin, the Permian sequence in Bellata-1 and Bohena-1, and the Triassic sequence in Coonarah-1A, lie within the oil generation range. In the intrusion-affected high maturity samples, the ratio is reaches pseudo-equilibrium. This and other terpane and sterane maturity parameters are not lowered (suppressed) in the perhydrous intervals. The ???????? sterane ratio, however, is slowest in reaction to maturity, and variations in low maturity samples are mainly due to facies changes. Diasterane/sterane ratios, in the current study, increase with increasing TOC content up to 5% TOC, but decrease in rocks with higher TOC contents including coals. Highly mature samples, as expected, in both cases are anomalous with high ratios. Calculated vitrinite reflectance based on the method of Radke and Welte (1983), as well as MPI 1 and MPI 2, shows the best comparison to observed values. These aromatic maturity parameters are lowered within the reflectance-suppressed intervals.  Oil stains in the Jurassic Pilliga Sandstone in the Bellata-1 well have been identified as being indigenous and not due to contamination. The vitrinite reflectance calculated to the oil stain suggests that the source rock should be within a late mature zone. Such high maturity levels are only recognised within intrusion-affected intervals. A close similarity between the oil stain sample and the intruded interval of the Napperby Formation is evident from the thermal maturity and biomarker content. Hydrocarbon generation and expulsion from the lower part of the Napperby Formation as a result of igneous intrusion effects is suggested as the source of the oil in this particular occurrence. Terpane and sterane maturity parameters increase with increasing burial depth in the intervals with suppressed (perhydrous) vitrinite reflectance. The generation maturity parameters also increase through intervals with perhydrous vitrinite, which suggests that hydrocarbons continue to be generated and the actual amount is increasing even though traditional rank ????????????stress???????????? maturity parameters are lowered. Accordingly, the Permian sequences in the lower part of the Bowen Basin are at least within the peak oil generation zone, and probably within late oil generation in the north and northeast of the study area. To generate significant amounts of hydrocarbon, however, the thickness of the shaly and coaly intervals in the Permian sequence is probably a critical parameter. In the Gunnedah Basin, a significant amount of hydrocarbon generation is probably only possible as a result of igneous intrusions.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Petroleum</field><field name="subject">Geology</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Gunnedah Basin</field><field name="subject">Surat Basin</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="subject">Bowen Basin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20537</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of a semi-automatic method for cellular migration and division analysis</field><field name="creator">Chu, Calvin, School of Biomedical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Binary image processing algorithms have been implemented in this study to create a background subtraction mask for the segmentation of cellular time lapse images. The complexity in the development of the background subtraction mask stems from the inherent difficulties in contrast resolution at the cellular boundaries.

In addition to the traditional center of mass or centroid approximation, a novel quasi-center of mass (QCM) derived from the local maxima of the distance transformation (DT) has also been proposed in this study.

The proposed methods overcome problems of ghosting and non-aligned aliasing artifacts, which can arise in regions of motion model failure, when the video is reconstructed at reduced temporal or spatial resolutions. We also study schemes which facilitate simultaneous scaling of compressed video bitstreams based on both constant bit-rate and constant distortion criteria, using simple and generic scaling operations.    In regions where the motion model fails, the motion compensated temporal discrete wavelet transform (MC TDWT) causes ghosting artifacts under frame-rate scaling, due to temporal lowpass filtering along invalid motion trajectories. To avoid ghosting artifacts, we adaptively select between different lowpass filters, based on a local estimate of the motion modelling accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive transform substantially removes ghosting artifacts while also preserving the high compression efficiency of the original MC TDWT.    We also study the impact of various MC 3D-DWT structures on spatial scalability. Investigating the interaction between spatial aliasing, scalability and energy compaction shows that the t+2D structure essentially has higher compression efficiency. However, where the motion model fails, structures of this form cause non-aligned aliasing artifacts under spatial scaling. We propose novel adaptive schemes to continuously adapt the structure of MC 3D-DWT based on information available within the compressed bitstream. Experimental results indicate that the proposed adaptive structure preserves the high compression efficiency of the t+2D structure while also avoiding the appearance of non-aligned aliasing artifacts under spatial scaling.    To provide simultaneous rate and distortion scaling, we study ???layered substream structure. Scaling based on distortion generates variable bit-rate traffic which satisfies the desired average bit-rate and is consistent with the requirements of leaky-bucket traffic models. We propose a novel method which also satisfies constraints on instantaneous bit-rate. This method overcomes the weakness of previous methods with small leaky-bucket buffer sizes. Simulation results indicate promising performance with both MC 3D-DWT interframe and JPEG2000 intraframe compression.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Scalable video</field><field name="subject">Adaptive</field><field name="subject">video compression</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20552</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The intransigent critic: reconsidering the reasons for Clement Greenberg???s formalist stance from the early 1930s to the early 1970s</field><field name="creator">Christofides, Sheila, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the reasons for Greenberg???s aesthetic intransigence ??? that is, his adherence to a formalist/purist stance, and his refusal to countenance non-purist twentiethcentury avant-garde trends evident in the art he ignored or denigrated, and in the art he promoted. The most substantial body of work challenged is Cold War revisionism (exemplified by the scholarship of Francis Frascina, Serge Guilbaut, and John O???Brian) which casts Greenberg as a politically expedient party to the imperialist agendas of various CIA-funded organisations. The major conclusions reached are that: Greenberg???s aesthetic intransigence was driven by a similarly intransigent ethico-political position, and that his critical method reflected patterns of argumentation set up in ???Avant-Garde and Kitsch??? (1939). This essay, and Greenberg???s ethico-political position, derived, not least, from his direct encounter with American Nazism and anti-Semitism which led him to realise that America (with what he saw as its decadence, cultural apathy, and low-level mass taste) was as vulnerable to the threat of totalitarianism as Europe and Russia. Reflecting this fear, ???Avant-Garde and Kitsch??? had juxtaposed a stagnant, impure culture with a vigorous avantgarde culture of impeccable vintage ??? in the process infusing politics into a formalist, historical conception of modernism Greenberg first devised in the early 1930s and then augmented, during 1938-9, with Hans Hofmann???s theories and others. Thus established, this rudimentary paradigm for Greenberg???s art writing was elaborated upon and made canonical in ???Towards a Newer Laocoon??? (1940), and entrenched after the war concurrent with the entrenchment of his ethico-political position. In the face of a Stalinist/capitalist war of wills, continuing anti-Semitism, and what Greenberg perceived as increasing decadence, he continued to argue for a serious, professionally-skilled (predominantly abstract) art, which would be resistant to the ersatz, yet not dehumanized by excluding the natural. By promoting this as the only genuine avant-garde art (while ignoring or denigrating playful, humorous and anarchic avant-garde tendencies), and by reiterating in the 1950s his pre-war Marxist sympathies, Greenberg was effectively demonstrating his continued hope for a utopian culture (luxuriant, formal, informed and socialist) first visualised in the late 1930s.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art critics</field><field name="subject">United States</field><field name="subject">Formalism (Art)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20562</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Towards the development of a comprehensive risk assessment methodology for building and transport fires</field><field name="creator">Blackmore, Jane, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Over the centuries, the assessment of risk has become an integral part of the decision process. Assessment techniques have developed to meet different applications, but all have problems and none is entirely suited to the assessment of risks relating to fire. This dissertation examines the development of risk assessment processes and frameworks, identifying common features and problems and key differences in approach. Despite generically similar approaches, different applications have led to the development of many different paradigms, none of which appears to be entirely suitable for application to building and infrastructure fires. Current fire risk assessment methods which incorporate important advances in fire modelling and Monte Carlo simulation, rely on a fire engineering approach. They tend to consider only the limited range of fire safety systems that are directly involved in construction, failing to address many of the procedural and other activities that can overwhelm traditional controls, and taking insufficient account of interactions between different controls and the factors that influence them. Further, comparative risk levels are generally evaluated against the ill-defined scenario of current practice, as defined in outdated prescriptive regulations. The result is that catastrophic consequences continue to occur, despite the presence of traditionally accepted controls. The problem is to find a framework that evaluates the sensitivity of levels of risk in fire against a defined, uncontrolled state, taking into account the effects of a comprehensive range of factors and controls. A new approach to risk assessment that addresses a comprehensive set of factors and controls and evaluates the event without, and with, controls, is considered. The framework, together with the steps for its implementation, appears to provide a versatile and flexible method of risk assessment. It is likely that the framework can be applied to all risk assessment situations. A study is undertaken to investigate the impact of factors and interactions that are not commonly taken into account in fire risk assessment. The chosen situation is a fire in the driver???s cab of a train. Current driver procedures are examined, and fire growth rates for specified materials are considered. Using the fire spread model CFAST, conditions in the cab for a range of ventilation conditions and fire growth rates are calculated. Threshold levels that determine response times for engineered and human controls and tenability, and common factors that influence consequences, can play a critical role in modelling the decision process. A driver???s decision model is proposed that determines the impact of the driver???s decisions to adjust ventilation by opening or closing windows and doors, and to extinguish the fire. The model takes into account time to respond and time to perform the necessary activities. The study shows that, even with a limited choice of actions, the decisions of the driver can have a critical effect on the outcome of a fire in the driver???s cab, altering the situation from a controlled to an uncontrolled state. Recommendations are made for further development of the new risk assessment framework, and for the development of fire modelling for risk assessment purposes. Finally, recommendations are made for the continuation of the development of the train driver response model that would result in the generation of driver decision support software.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fire prevention</field><field name="subject">Risk assessment</field><field name="subject">Buildings</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Transportation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20555</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Availability of iron to the marine cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula</field><field name="creator">Rose, Andrew, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Iron is an essential micronutrient that is required by some microorganisms in relatively large quantities. This is problematic for those inhabiting marine environments, where iron is highly insoluble and the dissolved fraction is predominantly strongly bound to organic compounds. Due to low supply and high demand, iron limits primary productivity in many oceanic waters, and may also limit growth of organisms in coastal waters under some circumstances. Recent incidents of explosive growth (???blooms???) of the noxious filamentous cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula in the coastal marine waters of Moreton Bay, Queensland, have prompted speculation that terrestrial human activities have increased iron availability to the organism, thus overcoming previous limitations on growth imposed by scarcity of the nutrient. This thesis describes work investigating the chemical form of iron in coastal waters under various environmental conditions and the way in which this influences its availability to L. majuscula. Chemical speciation of iron was investigated as a function of terrestrial-derived inputs of natural organic matter (NOM) of variable origin and sunlight in coastal marine waters, employing chemiluminescence-based and spectrophotometric techniques with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. These techniques allowed determination of iron and other chemical parameters at naturally occurring (typically nanomolar) concentrations. The mechanism of iron acquisition by L. majuscula was also investigated using a radioisotope-labelling labelling technique in addition to the other techniques described. Results indicated that iron speciation can be described by five classes: inorganic dissolved and organically complexed dissolved iron in both ferrous (reduced) and ferric (oxidised) forms, and precipitated inorganic iron. Simulation of laboratory results by numerical kinetic modelling of the processes investigated indicated that while the thermodynamic impetus is strongly towards precipitated iron, iron complexation by NOM and its reduction by sunlight-mediated processes and/or L. majuscula results in meta-stable dissolved species that are more readily available to L. majuscula. Superoxide is a critical intermediate in iron reduction by both sunlight and L. majuscula. Thus L. majuscula is capable of altering iron speciation to increase its availability, however uptake is also strongly dependent on environmental conditions and may be enhanced by increased inputs of iron, NOM and sunlight into coastal waters.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">iron</field><field name="subject">cyanobacteria</field><field name="subject">superoxide</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Space and dwelling : an interrogation of the relationship between public space, values, boundaries and belonging</field><field name="creator">Stevens, Gaye L., Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This document examines the public spaces created by the built environment of the city and asks: How is it that the apparently benign and benevolent activity of designing public space can in fact reinforce values that effectively marginalise and exclude significant groups of people? It contrasts the consequences of design decisions that are based on a value system of ???either/or??? with the possibility for designs based on ???both/and???. The perception of boundaries, the desire to dwell, the need to belong and the relationship of these phenomena to an understanding of ???self???, is proposed as the key means for analysing how public space is experienced by the user.  The document uses the language of barriers and boundaries to interrogate how the value systems of those with the control over resources is manifest in the built environment of the city, and examines the impact such environments have on the user???s desire to ???dwell??? and need to belong. The potential for an alternate paradigm based on a system that recognises ???both/and??? to produce beneficial outcomes is then proposed, with a focus on an ethic of care to complement the ethic of justice that currently guides design decisions for public space. Personal interviews with architects, town planners, representatives from relevant government agencies, and users of public space, participation in public meetings and systematic observation of specific sites have been used to inform the argument and assess the validity of claims. The document is extended by a body of visual work that further interrogates the need to belong and broader issues of the primal significance of ???sanctuary??? to the ability to ???dwell???. The making and maintaining of boundaries, necessary to form a sanctuary, is portrayed as a process fraught with insecurities and vulnerabilities necessitating, in circumstances where personal power or the ability to influence one???s environment is diminished, the use of subversive tactics in order to create a space in which one can belong.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public spaces</field><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Dwellings in art</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20572</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigations into static multileaf collimator based intensity modulated radiotherapy</field><field name="creator">Williams, Matthew John, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) is a modern radiotherapy treatment technique used to obtain highly conformal dose distributions.  The delivery of IMRT is commonly achieved through the use of a multileaf collimator (MLC).  One of the hindrances at present to the widespread use of IMRT is the increased time required for its planning, delivery and verification.  In this thesis one particular method of MLC based IMRT, known as Static Multileaf Collimator based IMRT (SMLC-IMRT), has been studied along with methods for improving it???s delivery efficiency.  The properties of an MLC commonly used in SMLC-IMRT have been characterised.  The potential ramifications of these properties on the dosimetric accuracy of the delivered IMRT field were also investigated.  An Interactive Leaf Sequencing (ILS) program was developed that allowed for the manipulation and processing of intensity maps using a variety of methods.  The objective of each method was to improve the delivery efficiency whilst maintaining the dosimetric quality of the IMRT treatment.  The different methods investigated were collimator angle optimisation, filtration, and intensity level optimisation.  The collimator was optimised by identifying the angle at which the minimum monitor unit???s (MU???s) were required when using a sliding-window delivery method.  A Savitzky-Golay filter was applied to random intensity maps and suitable filtration parameters identified for filtering clinical IMRT fields, and the intensity levels were optimised based on a deviation threshold.  The deviation threshold identified the acceptable level of difference tolerable between the original and modified intensity map.  Several IMRT cases were investigated and the impact of each the methods on MU???s, segments and dose distribution observed.  As the complexity of IMRT fields increases the dosimetric impact of the MLC properties increases.  Complex SMLC-IMRT fields require longer delivery times due to the increased number of MU???s and segments.  Collimator optimisation was shown to be a fast and effective means of improving delivery efficiency with negligible dosimetric change to the optimised plan.  Modifying intensity maps by applying a filter and optimising the intensity levels did reduce the complexity and improve the delivery efficiency, but also required a dosimetric compromise of the optimised plan.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intensity modulated radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">IMRT</field><field name="subject">SMLC</field><field name="subject">multileaf collimator</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20577</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrated environmental assessment of industrial products</field><field name="creator">Sun, Mingbo, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been successfully used as an environmental assessment tool for the development of ecologically sustainable products. The application of LCA in the early design stage has been constrained by the requirement of large amounts of data and time for carrying out the assessment. In addition, the complexity of LCA causes further difficulties for product developers. In order to integrate the environmental assessment into the process of product development, this research proposes an integrated decision model for sustainable product development and a simplified LCA approach for the application in the early stage of product design. The main advantage of the proposed model is that it incorporates the environmental aspects of product development into the existing product development framework. It enables designers to strike a balance between the product???s environmental performance and other traditional design objectives. The simplified LCA approach is based on the concept and application of Environmental Impact Drivers. Material-based environmental impacts and Energy-based environmental impacts are used to predict the total environmental impact of a product. Two sets of impact drivers were developed accordingly. The Material-based Impact Drivers were identified by classifying materials into 16 groups according to the nature of the materials and their environmental performance. Energy-based Impact Drivers were developed for various energy sources in major industrial regions. Product LCA cases were used to verify the proposed methods. The results computed by the application of the impact drivers were compared with the results of full LCA studies.   It is concluded that with the proposed approach, the product???s environmental performance can be assessed in a very short time and with very basic data input requirements and acceptable accuracy.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Design</field><field name="subject">Industrial</field><field name="subject">New products</field><field name="subject">Life cycle assessment</field><field name="subject">Environmental impact analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20587</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Point source compensation ??? a backpropagation method for underwater acoustic imaging</field><field name="creator">Yee, Clifford Wing Wei, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The backpropagation method of image reconstruction has been known for some time with the advantage of fast processing due to the use of Fast Fourier Transform. But its applicability to underwater imaging has been limited. At present the shift-and-add method is the more widely used method in underwater imaging. This is due to the fact that backpropagation has been derived for plane wave insonification, with the scattered waves detected in transmission-mode, or synthetic aperture set-up. One of the methods being used for underwater imaging is to use a point source for the insonification of the target and the scattered waves detected in reflection-mode by a receiver array. An advantage of this scanning method is only one transmission of the source is required to capture an image, instead of multiple transmissions. Therefore motion artifacts are kept to minimum. To be able to exploit the processing speed of the backpropagation method, it must be adapted for point source insonification. The coverage of this configuration in the literature has been scant, methods for spherical sources have been proposed for transmission mode and arbitrary surfaces in geophysical applications. These methods are complex and difficult to use. A novel point source compensation method is proposed in this thesis so that the backpropagation image formation method can be used for the point source insonification set-up. The method of investigation undertaken to derive this new backpropagation method was through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation and experimental verification. The effect of various compensation factors on the image quality was studied in simulation. In the experimental verification, practical issues relating to the application of the new method was addressed. The final proof of concept of our method was undertaken with our experimental verification. The quality of images formed with the point source compensation methods has also been compared with that with the shiftand- add method. Experimental and simulation results show that the point source compensated backpropagation algorithm can produce images of comparable quality with those formed with shift-and-add method for the set-up of wideband point-source insonification with detection in reflection-mode, with the advantage of faster image formation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Acoustic imaging</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From shadow citizens to teflon stars : cultural responses to the digital actor</field><field name="creator">Bode, Lisa Merle, Theatre, Film &amp; Dance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines an intermittent uncanniness that emerges in cultural responses to new image technologies, most recently in some impressions of the digital actor. The history of image technologies is punctuated by moments of fleeting strangeness: from Maxim Gorky's reading of the cinematographic image in terms of 'cursed grey shadows', to recent renderings of the computer-generated cast of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within as silicon-skinned mannequins. It is not merely the image's unfamiliar and new aesthetics that render it uncanny. Rather, the image is received within a cultural framework where its perceived strangeness speaks allegorically of what it means to be human at that historical moment. In various ways Walter Benjamin, Anson Rabinbach and N. Katherine Hayles have claimed that the notion and the experience of 'being human' is continuously transformed through processes related to different stages of modernity including rational thought, industrialisation, urbanisation, media and technology. In elaborating this argument, each of the four chapters is organized around the elucidation of a particular motif: 'dummy', 'siren', 'doppelg??nger' and 'resurrection'. These motifs circulate through discourses on different categories of digital actor, from those conceived without physical referents to those that are created as digital likenesses of living or dead celebrities. These cultural responses suggest that even while writers on the digital actor are speculating about the future, they are engaging with ideas about life, death and identity that are very old and very ambivalent.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">digital actor</field><field name="subject">cyberstar</field><field name="subject">synthespian</field><field name="subject">double</field><field name="subject">death</field><field name="subject">stars</field><field name="subject">media history</field><field name="subject">cinema history</field><field name="subject">Motion picture actors and actresses</field><field name="subject">Actors.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20593</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The mathematical structure of the BRST quantum constraint method</field><field name="creator">Costello, Patrick, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes structures of the quantum BRST constraint method in a mathematically rigorous manner by formulating it in a C*-algebraic context, leading to comparison of the quantum BRST and the Dirac constraint method in a rigorous manner.  Rigorous models are constructed for the heuristic examples of BRST for quantum electromagnetism (BRST-QEM) and Hamiltonian BRST with a finite number of constraints. This facilitates comparison between the results produced by the BRST method, and the results of the T-procedure of Grundling and Hurst for the quantum Dirac constraint method.  The different constraint methods are shown not to be equivalent for the examples of Hamiltonian BRST with a finite number of constraints that close, and a BRST-QEM model constructed using the Resolvent Algebra of Buchholz and Grundling with covariant test function space. These observations lead to the following three consequences.  The quantum BRST method, and quantum Dirac method of constraints, are not equivalent in general.  Examples of quantum Hamiltonian BRST can be constructed to show that the BRST method does not remove the ghosts in the BRST physical algebra. This occurs since quantum Hamiltonian BRSTselects multiple copies of the physical state space selected by the Dirac algorithm, and the ghosts are not removed from the BRST-physical state space. Extra selection criteria are required to select the correct physical space, which do not gaurantee correspondence between the Dirac and BRST physical algebras.  Conversely, the BRST physical algebra and Dirac physical algebra coincide when QEM is encoded in the auxiliary Resolvent Algebra. This is a rigorous example of Lagrangian BRST, hence quantum Lagrangian and quantum Hamiltonian BRST are not equivalent constraint methods.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Vanishing paradise : planning and conflict in Bali</field><field name="creator">Suartika, Gusti Ayu Made, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is about the continuing life of Balinese culture and traditions currently under threat from unregulated economic development, mass tourism, and migration. Critical to this study are considerations surrounding the control of land and its improvements, as well as the success and failure of urban planning within the sphere of cultural conservation. The thesis argues that ???State planning systems as imposed by the Indonesian government are inappropriate in the Balinese context.??? While this statement seems fairly straightforward on the surface, it involves a complex understanding of the forces mentioned above, of their interaction and their effects on local culture. This study adopts a hermeneutic approach to theory seeking greater depth of meaning rather than discovering new facts, and embodies three main strategies. The first explains the relationship between society and space using a cultural matrix derived from anthropologist E.T.Hall. The second strategy deploys qualitative research method using focus groups, and third, it uses in-depth personal surveys at physical sites. The thesis therefore reveals the eroding impacts of tourism on local culture. Focusing on territoriality, it embraces two contradicting sets of values represented in the traditional Balinese system of Adat, and those of the market-based system of the Indonesian State. Resulting conflicts are demonstrated through specific and generic case studies. Here, the dominant position of modern state planning establishes the legal foundation on which capitalist practices, the dominating role of private enterprise, corruption, and collusionary attitudes are nourished. While the role of the government in promoting tourism, and the economic significance of the industry are acknowledged, the study measures these against the costs of such advantages to the Balinese way of life. Overall, the thesis reflects upon ongoing territorial problems that have been experienced in Bali for more than forty years. It provides an in depth analysis of how state imposed planning systems are locked in critical conflict with the proven and functioning traditional Balinese Adat. Finally, the necessary features of future planning systems are proposed in order to revitalize local culture. Hence the thesis demonstrates that modern systems of planning are inappropriate to Balinese cultural conservation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">City planning</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Bali Island</field><field name="subject">Bali Island (Indonesia)</field><field name="subject">Buildings</field><field name="subject">structures</field><field name="subject">etc.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20631</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The state, local communities and women : a study of women???s organisations in Malang, East Java.</field><field name="creator">Martin, Kirsty, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an ethnographic study of five women???s organisations in Malang, Indonesia. The contemporary significance of local women???s organisations in the lives of kampung women in Indonesia is revealed through an investigation of the relationship between the Indonesian state, local communities and women. This study sets contemporary women???s organisations in the context of their changing historical role and relationship with the state. Women???s organisations have been a part of the Indonesian political and social landscape since the early twentieth century. They played an important role in mobilising women during the struggle for independence. Under Sukarno???s policy of Guided Democracy, restrictions were placed on the political mobilising role of all organisations, including those for women. These restrictions were taken much further under Suharto???s New Order government when many were proscribed. Only state-approved and controlled organisations were accepted. The New Order era essentially undermined the credibility of women???s organisations as vehicles for promoting women???s interests, instead they were generally regarded as ???tools of the state???. Indonesianists and feminists have been especially critical of state-run women???s organisations arguing they have offered Indonesian women ???no path to female power???. This perception of state-sponsored women???s organisations has continued in the post-Suharto era even though their links to the state have changed radically. They now exist alongside a range of NGOs, religious and social women???s organisations. The crucial question that this thesis addresses is why these state-sponsored organisations continue to exist and what motivates women???s participation in these organisations? Through membership in local women???s organisations women enter into a complex relationship with the state, local society and the socio-religious and political institutions within the wider society. The membership status women enjoy provides them with opportunities to engage in a social bargain. Through this bargaining process, local women make social, religious, personal and romantic gains for themselves. The results of the social bargaining process depend largely on the particular organisation to which women belong but they remain strongly oriented towards their local kampung worlds. The thesis provides an alternative way of thinking about the complex role that women???s organisations play in Indonesian society and what function they may continue to have within Indonesia???s post-Suharto future.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women</field><field name="subject">Indonesia</field><field name="subject">Societies and clubs</field><field name="subject">Politics and government</field><field name="subject">1966-</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20637</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Colonial governance and art education in colonial Punjab c1849-1920s</field><field name="creator">Tarar, Nadeem Omar, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines the connection between colonial governance and art education in colonial Punjab after its annexation by the British in 1849. It argues that art education at the Mayo School of Art was part of large project for creating a disciplinary society. It draws largely on archival and printed primary sources for tracing the career of disciplinary technologies of art schools, museums, exhibitions as well as regulatory discourses of colonial anthropology and the folklore, that together constitute colonial sphere of art education.  The archives entered the present study both as the source of information as well as the technology of the colonial rule. The disciplinary discourses of the colonial state formed the primary archive for the colonial construction and ranking of indigenous population on the evolutionary scale of "primitive" through the techniques of census and surveys. The ethnological, psychological and intellectual profile of "tribal" population of Punjab along the scale of evolutionary history provided a grid to structure empirical knowledge for vast scale social engineering of indigenous society, including the organization of a system of colonial education for "pre-literate" and "oral" society.  The study specifically contends that boundaries between "oral" and "literate" were the folklorist prisms through which the practices of communities and institutions of "art" and "craft", the distinctions between, "primitive" and "modem", "artists" and "craftsmen", "traditional" and "creative", "anonymous" and "individuals", "literature" and "myth", "history" and "legend", and "knowledge" and "folklore" were articulated. The historical contingencies of naturalization of these binary oppositions will be read in the ethnographic project of the colonial state and art educational discourses in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century Punjab that transformed individuals and social groups into subjects of a particular kind of power through the techniques of discipline and regulation.  The institutional career of the Mayo School of Art (from 1875 to 1920s) as a technical as well as an educational institution is located at the intersection of discourses on utility and aesthetics. Through the writings of key exponents of the British craft advocates in India and the administrative discourses of the colonial state in Punjab that had brought the study of "decorative arts" to the forefront of the imperial concerns as well as art pedagogy, the dissertation analyzes the implications of the art school instruction on the production of modern artists and craftsmen and the construction of "customary" sphere and "traditional" Punjabi art and craft.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Art -- Study and teaching -- India.</field><field name="subject">Mayo School of Art.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44097</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Silent bang</field><field name="creator">Behrens, Monika, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The research project uses still life as a means of exploring current events of violence and oppression.

The research project uses these themes to convey the message that violence is both a barbaric way of dealing with conflict and a senseless form of self-expression.  I have used symbols and metaphors to build a visual language. For the language to be translated accurately a great deal of research has taken place into the appropriate still life objects for each work. Each work incorporates metaphors and or symbols for both the oppressor and victim within the event being represented.  The studio outcome of this research project, Silent Bang, includes a series of highly detailed finished paintings of various scales. Silent Bang as a body of work is colourful and aims to be aesthetically pleasing in addition to conveying a powerful message that incites interpretation.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toys in art.</field><field name="subject">Violence in art.</field><field name="subject">War in art.</field><field name="subject">Symbolism in art.</field><field name="subject">Politics in art.</field><field name="subject">Still-life painting -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="subject">Art, Modern -- 21st century -- Political aspects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42557</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of shear-induced breakup and restructuring on the size and structure of aggregates</field><field name="creator">Marsh, Peter, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this work was to use simulation as a tool to better understand areas of orthokinetic (shear-induced) aggregation which are still not well understood. These areas include aggregate structure, aggregate strength, breakup and restructuring and combined perikinetic/orthokinetic aggregation. Previous simulation studies were reviewed and it was concluded that the methodology of Chen and Doi (1989) was an appropriate starting point for this study. The modified simulation was validated by comparison with theoretical and experimental results.   Orthokinetic aggregates were found to have a fractal structure with an estimated value of 1.65. Scaling exponents, which were shown to be indicative of fractal dimension, of 2.1-2.7 were also obtained.  Flexible bonds allowed restructuring to occur which led to an increase in the co-ordination number, scaling exponent, aggregate strength and a reduction in aggregate size. Thus aggregate strength increases with fractal dimension. It was confirmed that both restructuring and breakup/reformation could lead to the formation of small, compact aggregates. The high shear conditions simulated favoured breakup/reformation, while restructuring was expected to dominate with more flexible bonds, possibly at lower shear rates.  Taking some account of hydrodynamic interactions by the inclusion of Kirkwood-Riseman theory led to an increase in the compactness of the aggregates and the co-ordination numbers, as well as a decrease in size of the aggregates. The results showed that hydrodynamic interactions can not be ignored. The explanation for the dramatic effects was that particles/microflocs on the outer edges of the aggregates broke off and reformed in a more compact way.  Erosion was found to dominate in all cases, thus supporting the theory that erosion dominates at higher fractal dimensions. The shearing range simulated was found to be relatively high (equivalent to &amp;lt200s-1 for particles of 2-5??m), producing relatively small aggregates. Hence it is proposed that under high shear conditions, erosion dominates.  It was shown by extension of the DLCA algorithmic restructuring work of Meakin and Jullien (1988, 1989) that the scattering patterns observed in gently sheared aggregating systems are consistent with the interpretation that the shearing causes partial restructuring at large length scales.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aggregates (Building materials)</field><field name="subject">Shear (Mechanics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Toward a CMMI specific practice implementation planning reference model</field><field name="creator">Chen, Xi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Over the past two decades, software engineering researchers and practitioners have developed, studied, and used standards and models for software process improvement and assessment. CMMI ("Capability Maturity Model Integration") is a widely known software process maturity model that describes the practices that should be performed by mature organizations. However, there is also no clear mapping between process improvement and business goals, and few authors provide guidance on how to implement the CMMI Specific Practices (SPs) within a Process Area or Maturity Level. This thesis proposes an SP implementation reference model that maps inter-dependent SPs to particular improvement outcomes.  The CMMI specification is interpreted using qualitative textual analysis to develop schemes to frame CMMI SPs from the perspectives of outcomes, activities, and work products. The first scheme is an SP classification model, defined by four outcome areas (organization, process, project and product) and four activity groups (plan, do, check and improve). The SPs in Maturity Level 2 are assigned to one or more of sixteen outcome/activity categories and are analyzed in terms of those categories. The second scheme is an SP dependencies model, created by identifying work products used and produced by SPs, and by graphically visualizing their relationships. The SPs in Maturity Level 2 are analysed using the scheme to provide a reference model of their order of implementation, given the identified relationships. The third scheme is a goal-directed SP implementation planning reference model constructed by combining the two earlier schemes. This scheme uses an algorithm to search for all the dependency precedents of SPs in a given outcome/activity category. Conditions are also defined to reduce some of the dependencies. The output shows the SPs required to achieve the goal that the given category represents, and shows the order of implementation for those SPs, respecting the dependency constraints. This model is intended to guide practitioners in prioritizing and sequencing the implementation of SPs.  The three schemes contribute to the CMMI research community by increasing understanding about what can be improved by CMMI SPs, with reference to the outcomes of implementing SPs, and about how software processes can be improved using CMMI, with reference to the implementation order of SPs. They also contribute an analytical approach to interpret the practices in SPI specifications.  The SP classification model is used to reinterpret previous research to show that SMEs tend to focus on planning and doing project-related and product-related practices, but not on checking or improving project-related or product-related practices. When planning and developing products, SMEs try to ensure that the project progresses as planned to meet the deadline. However, practices that support this are lacking within CMMI, especially for estimation, evaluation, verification, and validation. The thesis also contributes to the CMMI community by identifying points of ambiguity, inconsistency and incompleteness in the CMMI standard.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42595</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pattern-based data and application integration in service oriented architectures</field><field name="creator">Kongdenfha, Woralak, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The success of Web services comes from the benefits that it brings in reducing the cost and the time needed to develop data and applications by reusing them, and simplifying their integrations through standardization. However, standardization in Web services does not remove the need for adapters due to possible heterogeneity among service interface and protocol definitions. Moreover, the current service APIs are targeted toward professional programmers, but not accessible to a wider class of users without programming expertise, but would never the less like to build their own integrated applications. In this dissertation, we propose methods and tools to support both service developers and non-expert users in their data and application integration tasks. To support service developers, we propose a framework that enables rapid development of Web service adapters. We investigate particularly the problem of service adaptation focusing on business interface and protocol layers. Our study shows that many differences between business interfaces and protocols are recurring. We introduce mismatch patterns to capture these recurring differences and provide solutions to resolve them. We present the notion of adaptation aspects, which is based on the aspect-oriented programming paradigm, to enable rapid development and deployment of service adapters. We also present a comparative study between standalone and aspect-oriented adapters development. The study shows that the aspect-oriented approach is preferable in many cases, especially when adapters need to access internal states of services. The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype tool, which is used to illustrate how it simplifies adapters development through a case study. To support users without programming expertise, we propose a spreadsheet-based Web mashups development framework, which enables users to develop mashups in the popular spreadsheet environment. First, we provide a mechanism that makes structured data first class values of spreadsheet cells. Second, we propose a new component model that can be used to develop fairly sophisticated mashups, involving joining data sources and keeping spreadsheet data up to date. Third, to simplify mashup development, we provide a collection of spreadsheet-based mashup patterns that captures common Web data access and spreadsheet presentation functionalities. Users can reuse and customize these patterns to build spreadsheet-based Web mashups instead of developing them from scratch. Fourth, we enable users to manipulate structured data presented on spreadsheet in a drag-and-drop fashion. Finally, we have developed and tested a prototype tool to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Web data mashups</field><field name="subject">Service Oriented Computing</field><field name="subject">Web services integration</field><field name="subject">Web services adaptation</field><field name="subject">Aspect-oriented programming</field><field name="subject">Mismatch patterns</field><field name="subject">Spreadsheets</field><field name="subject">Component model</field><field name="subject">Spreadsheet-based Web mashups Patterns</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42600</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electrospray ionisation fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry of metal-flavonoid complexes</field><field name="creator">Sarowar, Chowdhury Hasan, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Positive-ion electrospray ionisation Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and ion trap mass spectrometry have been used to investigate the reactions of the flavonoids 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone, 5-methoxyflavoe, quercetin, quercitrin and rutin with monovalent Li+, Na+, K+ and Cs+, divalent Cu2+, Zn2+ and Pb2+ and trivalent La3+ and Eu3+ metal cations. The effect of capillary-skimmer potential difference and the ion residence time in the hexapole ion trap of the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer are systematically investigated for the flavonoid-alkali and divalent metal ion experiment. It is observed that these variables impact significantly on the type of ions observed in the ESI experiments and hence the mass spectra. The binding selectivity of alkali metal ions towards 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 5-methoxyflavone are determined using the results from FTICR mass spectrometry experiments. The selectivity order follows the order Li+&gt;Na+&gt;K+ for individual flavonoids. Collision-induced dissociation experiments are carried out by Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance and ion trap mass spectrometry to compare the fragmentation behaviour of metal-flavonoid complexes. Low energy collision-induced dissociation experiments of the [2L+M]+ for 3-hydroxyflavone, 5-hydroxyflavone and 5-methoxyflavone alkali metal complexes show the loss of ligand only. When the energy is increased only the lithiated dimer [2L+Li]+ for 5-methoxyflavone shows the loss of methyl radical along with the ligand. For quercitrin the predominant dissociation pathways are the loss of rhamnose for Li+, Na+ and K+ complexes although aglycone loss is also observed for the K+ complex. The favourable dissociation pathways for rutin are the loss of disaccharide, aglycone and rhamnose for the Na+ complex and the loss of disaccharide for the K+ complex. Collision-induced dissociation data are also used to determine the threshold dissociation energies for displacement of one flavonoid ligand from alkali metal flavonoid complexes. The threshold dissociation energies for loss of one ligand from [2L+M]+ of 5-methoxyflavone and quercitrin follow the order Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+, rutin follows the order Na+ &gt; K+ &gt; Li+ , and 3-hydroxyflavone and 5-hydroxyflavone follow the order Li+ &gt; Na+. For the same metal cation experiment, 5-methoxyflavone system has the highest dissociation energy compared to the 3-hydroxyflavone and 5-hydroxyflavone experiment. Preliminary DFT calculations show that the calculated dissociation energies follow the same trend as the experimental dissociation energies for the simple flavonoid alkali metal cation experiments. For 5-methoxyflavone-divalent metal cation (Zn2+, Cu2+ and Pb2+) complexes loss of methyl radical is the common process. CO loss is also observed for the Zn2+ complex whereas CHO and H2O losses are observed for Cu2+. For 3-hydroxyflavone and 5-hydroxyflavone divalent metal cation experiments loss of ligand is the dominant process. Zn2+ and Cu2+ complexes also show CO loss. La3+ and Er3+ with the same flavonoids show the ligand as the dominant product. For quercetin-divalent metal cation experiment, ligand loss is the dominant process. For quercitrin and rutin various dissociation products are observed where the dissociation occurs via the loss of the rhamnose and/or the disaccharide moieties. Similar dissociation patterns are also observed for La3+ and Er3+ complexes for quercitrin and rutin.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">metal cations</field><field name="subject">flavonoid,</field><field name="subject">Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance</field><field name="subject">ion trap,</field><field name="subject">capillary-skimmer potential difference</field><field name="subject">Collision-induced dissociation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43658</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Storing and querying time series data in a sensor network</field><field name="creator">Chhieng, Van Munin, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis contains several contributions that extend from the sensor network to the time series data research disciplines. Our contributions are as follows: We provide a path decomposition technique that is capable of systematically and autonomously producing mobile sink paths for data gathering in large sensor networks. We also provide an energy-efficient routing protocol that is used to establish a path between two nodes in a sensor network. This protocol allows users to query a sensor network directly without the need for the mobile sink. As the size of the sensor database is getting larger, we incorporate the storing, indexing and querying techniques into an insertion and retrieval framework. This shortens the querying time. We also identify a problem that exists during the filetering phase. To rectify this problem, we provide a stitching algorithm. This technique computes an improved lower bounding distance. As a result, the query time is reduced.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42609</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implied volatility: general properties and asymptotics</field><field name="creator">Roper, Michael Paul Veran, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates implied volatility in general classes of stock price models. To begin with, we take a very general view. We find that implied volatility is always, everywhere, and for every expiry well-defined only if the stock price is a non-negative martingale. We also derive sufficient and close to necessary conditions for an implied volatility surface to be free from static arbitrage. In this context, free from static arbitrage means that the call price surface generated by the implied volatility surface is free from static arbitrage. We also investigate the small time to expiry behaviour of implied volatility. We do this in almost complete generality, assuming only that the call price surface is non-decreasing and right continuous in time to expiry and that the call surface satisfies the no-arbitrage bounds (S-K)+&#8804; C(K, &#964;)&#8804; S. We used S to denote the current stock price, K to be a option strike price, &#964; denotes time to expiry, and C(K, &#964;) the price of the K strike option expiring in &#964; time units. Under these weak assumptions, we obtain exact asymptotic formulae relating the call price surface and the implied volatility surface close to expiry. We apply our general asymptotic formulae to determining the small time to expiry behaviour of implied volatility in a variety of models. We consider exponential L??vy models, obtaining new and somewhat surprising results. We then investigate the behaviour close to expiry of stochastic volatility models in the at-the-money case. Our results generalise what is already known and by a novel method of proof. In the not at-the-money case, we consider local volatility models using classical results of Varadhan. In obtaining the asymptotics for local volatility models, we use a representation of the European call as an integral over time to expiry. We devote an entire chapter to representations of the European call option; a key role is played by local time and the argument of Klebaner. A novel alternative that is especially useful in the local volatility case is also presented.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small expiry asymptotics</field><field name="subject">Mathematical Finance</field><field name="subject">Implied Volatility</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44519</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Savings and recovery after extinction of a classically conditioned response in the rabbit</field><field name="creator">Weidemann, Gabrielle, School Of Psychology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The experiments described in this thesis examined post-extinction recovery phenomena following classical conditioning in the rabbit. The first series of experiments examined the rate of reacquisition to the original conditioned stimulus (CS) and to a cross-modal CS following various amounts of extinction. In both the rabbit nictitating membrane (NM) preparation and rabbit heart rate (HR) conditioning, there was a graded reduction in the rate of reacquisition as a direct function of the number of extinction trials. In the rabbit NM preparation, there was also a graded reduction in the rate of acquisition to a cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light). However, concurrent recovery of responding to the original, extinguished stimulus (CSA, e.g., tone) during training with a novel, cross-modal stimulus (CSB, e.g., light), appeared uniformly robust even following extensive extinction. The second series of experiments examined the conditions necessary for concurrent recovery to occur in the rabbit NM preparation. The introduction of CSB-US pairings resulted in strong recovery of responding to CSA, while the reintroduction of the US alone failed to result in any discernable reinstatement of responding to CSA. Concurrent recovery was specific to the trained and extinguished CSA, with virtually no generalized responding to a novel cross-modal test stimulus (CSC). However, pretraining with CSB-US pairings significantly reduced the amount of recovery to CSA during subsequent CSB???US pairings. The third series of experiments revealed that concurrent recovery was specific to the extinguished stimulus (CSA) with only moderate generalization to other familiar but untrained stimuli in the same modality as CSA. Together these results indicate that concurrent recovery is not primarily the result of the unmasking of the original CSA-US association. Rather, concurrent recovery appears to be at least partially the result of learning-dependent generalization. However, in order for responding to CSB, to generalize to CSA, CSA must have been paired with the same US which is subsequently paired with CSB. Thus, the CSA-US association must be partially intact for concurrent recovery to occur. A layered network model with multiple hidden units is able to simulate rapid reacquisition, facilitated cross-modal acquisition and concurrent recovery.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Conditioned response</field><field name="subject">Classical conditioning</field><field name="subject">Rabbits</field><field name="subject">Physiology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20646</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studies of the poisoning of DNA Topoisomerase II?? by Acridine-4-Carboxamides and related Cytotoxins</field><field name="creator">Freewan, Mohammed, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The central role of topoisomerase II in DNA transactions such as replication, transcription, and chromosome segregation, has led to the development of antimicrobial and anticancer agents that inhibit its DNA cleavage and religation functions by a mechanism known as topoisomerase poisoning. Poisoning involves the formation of a ternary complex between drug, DNA, and enzyme that stabilizes the cleavage complex, thereby inhibiting religation. In this work, we have prepared purified recombinant human topo II??, and used enzymatic and sequencing methods to probe the molecular interactions that stabilize the ternary complexes of several classical and acridine-4carboxamide topo II poisons. These studies used agarose gel techniques to assay inhibition of the relaxation of supercoiling, and the production of single and double strand DNA breaks, in pBR322 DNA. The findings are supported by acrylamide gel measurements to determine the nucleotide sequences at which the compounds trap topo II??. The results confirm the biologically active acridine-4-carboxamides DACA, ASDACA, 9-amino-DACA, and the threading 9-anilino-acridine-4-carboxamide SN 16713, as topo IIa poisons. By contrast, inactive analogues bearing morpholino and piperidine side chains fail to trap the cleavable complex, despite the fact that their side chains form hydrogen bonding interactions with guanine in DNA in the same manner as 9-amino-DACA. These findings emphasize the specific nature of the molecular interactions between drug, DNA, and protein in the ternary complex, and suggest that the N,N-dimethylamino groups of the active compounds occupy a cavity that is too small to accommodate the larger cyclic side chains. We have made a detailed comparison of the consensus sequences for enzyme trapping by DACA, AS-DACA, 9amino-DACA, SN 16713, amsacrine, etoposide, and mitoxantrone. The data have been interpreted in terms of a model for the trapped cleavable complex based on the crystal structure of the topo II-DNA complex of Dong and Berger (Nature, 2007, 450:12011205). The model proposes that amsacrine and etoposide trap the enzyme by binding in the DNA minor groove, with their side chains interacting with amino acid residues of the toprim domain that contribute to the active site. By contrast, it is proposed that mitoxantrone and the acridine-4-carboxamides bind to DNA in the complex with their side chains in the major groove, making bonding interactions with guanine bases and the a4 helix of the topo IIa CAP domain. SN 16713 poisons topo II more in the manner of amsacrine than DACA, implying that its anilino ring dominates over its carboxamide side chain in stabilising the cleavable complex.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42615</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The digger myth and Australian society : genesis, operation and review</field><field name="creator">Cummins, Philip S A, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">Through a theoretical framework of myth in genesis, operation and review, this thesis evaluates the relationship between Australian society and the myth of the digger, a tradition of Australian military manhood which originated in the First World War. The digger in genesis was a product of early twentieth century Australia???s need to establish for itself a distinct national identity. Deriving strongly from existing mythology of the bushman/pioneer and foster by the work of CEW Bean, it was quickly adopted by both governments and citizens anxious to promote the contributions of the Australian soldiers and to understand the relationships that these had with the emerging Australian society. The digger in operation from the First World War to the end of the Second World War to the early 1960s demonstrates the way in which Australian (enamoured of its simple and seemingly enduring qualities) Embedded the myth at the core of orthodox thinking about national Identity, despite its exclusivity and prescriptive, authoritarian control by conservative institutions. The era of the Vietnam War acted as a key review phase for the myth as its relevance was questioned significantly. Despite temporary rejection from many and fragmentation into a variety of icons, Australia???s brief flirtation with radical thinking did not last beyond the mid-1970s. A return to conservative values in the 1980s-1990s coincided with political reconciliation over the Vietnam War ??? by the mid-1990s, the digger myth had retained its position of relevance and importance within Australian culture, demonstrating its capacity to become adapted and appropriated to reflect an increasingly democratic and pluralistic society. The current prevailing version of the digger, the &amp;quotnew professional&amp;quot, demonstrates the parallel transition of Australian military culture. It co-exist with other representations, providing a scaffold through which individuals interact with it to develop their own understanding of the application of the digger myth to both their own lives and Australian society.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia.

Experiments were performed using stirred cell equipment, polymeric membranes and synthetic surface water containing natural organics, inorganic colloids and their aggregates, and cations. All processes could remove a significant amount of natural organics. Pretreatment with ferric chloride was required to achieve significant organic removal with MF and high MWCO UF. Additionally, fouling mechanisms for the three processes were investigated. Crucial parameters were aggregate characteristics (fractal structure, stability, organic-colloid interactions), solubility of organics and calcium, and hydrodynamics. In MF, fouling by pore plugging was most severe. Variations in solution chemistry changed the aggregation state of the colloids and/or natural organic matter and dramatically affected rejection and fouling behaviour. UF membrane fouling was mainly influenced by pore adsorption and could improve natural organics rejection significantly. Coagulant addition shifted fouling mechanism from pore adsorption to cake formation. Aggregate structure was most significant for flux decline. In NF, rejection of natural organics involved both size and charge exclusion. Fouling was caused by precipitation of a calcium-organic complex. Fouling could be avoided by pretreatment with metal salt coagulants. Thorough chemical characterisation of the organics used demonstrated that only size and aromaticity can be related to fouling. The study is concluded with a process comparison based on a water quality parameter and a cost comparison. Treatment cost of microfiltration with chemical pretreatment was similar to that of nanofiltration at a comparable natural organics rejection.</field><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">natural organic matter</field><field name="subject">microfiltration</field><field name="subject">ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">nanofiltration</field><field name="subject">removal</field><field name="subject">fouling</field><field name="subject">cations</field><field name="subject">cost</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20695</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Teaching styles and student behaviour in instrumental music lessons in Australian conservatoriums</field><field name="creator">Zhukov, Katie, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">This investigation into instrumental music teaching at the tertiary (conservatorium) level sought to observe and describe typical teacher and student behaviour in this under-researched educational setting. The aim of the study was to examine a wide range of areas associated with instrumental music teaching in order to identify patterns of behaviour exhibited by teachers and students and to define teaching and learning styles present in advanced applied music teaching. After a review of literature on teaching in general and on music teaching in particular, an observational instrument for individual instrumental music lessons was developed and refined in pilot studies. 12 prominent Australian teachers were videotaped teaching 24 students, with the sample being balanced geographically, institutionally, by instrument (three mainstream groups: piano, strings and winds) and by gender (equal numbers of male and female teachers and students). Steps were taken to observe realistic teaching of typical students and to minimise the observer???s intrusion into the lesson dynamics. The videotaped lessons were analysed using an observational instrument and the data was subjected to various statistical analyses. Results are reported according to five main areas (lesson structure, lesson content, teaching methodology, teacher/ student relationship, and teaching and learning styles) and discussed with reference to existing literature. The conclusions of this study enhance current understanding of studio music teaching, by supporting many of the findings of previous research and substantiating their application to advanced instrumental music teaching. This study provides new insights into the underlying structure of instrumental music lessons, the primacy of technique in terms of lesson content, the use of teaching strategies such as demonstration, evaluation and questioning, gender differences between teachers and between students, and the types of teaching and learning styles that are prevalent in conservatorium settings.

It is not a mechanical routine but something essential to my daily life. I go to the piano, and I play two preludes and fugues by Bach??? It is a sort of benediction on the house??? It is a rediscovery of the wonder of which I have the joy of being a part. It fills me with awareness of the wonder of life, with a feeling of the incredible marvel of being a human being. The music is never the same for me, never. Each day it is something new, fantastic, and unbelievable. That is Bach??? a miracle! A whole radiance of space and poetry pours forth from them! They are the very essence of Bach, and Bach is the essence of music. (Casals:1974:17 &amp; 47). Such comments, common among musicians, are usually ignored by the disciplines that study music. This thesis, however, is the result of a decision to take these comments seriously. This thesis addresses the issues of creativity, order and discipline, through the perspective of a sociology and phenomenology of everyday life. The main issues of this thesis are first introduced through Bachelard???s phenomenological study of poetry and Heidegger???s approach to art. Embodied modes of knowing are introduced through Buber???s dialogic I-Thou concept. This is followed by Winnicott???s discussion of creativity and Bohm and Peat???s discussion of order. Discipline is introduced through a counter-analysis of some central sociological theorists on authority and power: Lukes, Foucault and Durkheim. Among other writers influential for the thesis are Eliade on origins, sacred temporality and ???eternal return???, Simmel and Douglas on space, Levinas, Merton, Herrigel and Stendl- Rast on ethics and discipline. Hegel and Sartre on identity-logic and Serres on relational modes of knowing. The main issues are drawn from experiences with music and particularly with the music of J. S. Bach. These experiences raise ontological, cosmological and epistemological questions that are examined in this thesis.

Extracellular deposition of beta amyloid (Abeta plaques), intraneuronal tau accumulation, inflammation (activated astrocytes and microglia), and neuronal loss are all consistent pathological features of the disease. Unlike Abeta plaques, inflammation correlates with neuronal loss and cognitive decline in AD, suggesting it plays an important role in disease progression. Recent research has also identified soluble oligomeric Abeta species in the AD brain, which correlate with disease progression and are proposed to be more neurotoxic than their fibrillar counterpart. The main aims of this thesis were to determine whether oligomeric Abeta is a more powerful stimulator of the inflammatory response compared to fibrillar forms of the protein, to identify potential mediators of this response and to determine downstream neuronal changes. Isolated human primary astrocytic, microglial and neuronal cell cultures were used to assess which Abeta alloform and conformation was more neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory. A total of 17 inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were measured simultaneously using a Multiplex approach and neurotoxicity was assessed by lactate dehydrogenase release. Cell cultures involving all three cell types were also used to examine these inflammatory mediators in a more complex system, and direct changes in tau levels and/or phosphorylation determined by western immunoblotting. Further immunohistochemical analysis determined the localisation of oligomeric Abeta within post-mortem human AD brain tissue.  The data clearly shows that oligomeric Abeta was more neurotoxic and neuroinflammatory than fibrillar Abeta, with oligomeric Abeta40 favoured in toxic plaque deposits in AD brain tissue. Cell culture experiments showed that glia clearly mediate neuroprotection against oligomeric Abeta. Soluble TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-12 mediate this response early in disease, with a decline in their secretion and a sustained increase in IL-1alpha, IFN-gamma, GM-CSF,  MIP-1beta, and IL-8 provoking increased tau protein expression. Overall, the data clearly demonstrates oligomeric Abeta more powerfully stimulates a suite of inflammatory mediators affecting neuronal survival and tau pathology, although the contribution of additional glial-derived factors must also be determined. The identification of these inflammatory mediators, in combination with other potential factors, may lead to the development of mechanistic therapeutic interventions that could target these early pathological changes.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">amyloid</field><field name="subject">inflammation</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's Disease</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42741</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sydney gay saunas 1967???2000 : fight for civic acceptance and experiences beyond the threshold</field><field name="creator">Prior, Jason Hugh, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The gay sauna played a central role in the battle for gay liberation in Sydney during the latter part of the twentieth century. This thesis examines the conjunction of social and political forces which contributed to the acceptance of the gay sauna by Sydney???s civic society. Two questions reveal this process:  1. How was an illegal and clandestine place for homosexuals, perceived as a threat to the moral standards of Sydney, transformed into an institutional entity, legally recognised as ???crucial???, and important within particular environs of this city? 2. How did the evolving public domain of gay saunas contribute to the development of gay culture in Sydney by fostering the opportunities for individual and collective expression of homosexual practices?  This study is contextualised within international and Australian studies of the sexualisation of urban spaces???such as Michel Foucault???s, Manuel Castells??? and Lawrence Knopp???s???and the role of the built environment in the development of sexual identity and sexual practices???such as Gayle Rubin???s, John Ricco???s, and Joel Brodsky???s. The first part of the thesis is an empirical analysis of development applications for gay saunas in Sydney between 1967 and 2000 which reveals the play of forces within state and local government, legislative processes, the homosexual community and broader civic stakeholders through which the gay sauna achieved acceptance in Sydney???s civic society. Two principal research approaches???documentary research and twenty in-depth interviews???were used in this first part. The second part of the thesis is an ethnography that uses twenty-nine in-depth interviews to provided a unique insight into the evolving public domain of Sydney???s gay saunas and how they fostered the experiences of gay men, allowing gay men to develop individual and collective sexual identities and practices.  This exploration of the interplay of built form, sexuality, civic governance, social identity and social action provide a sociological contribution which will also be of interest to gay studies, anthropology, architecture, geography and planning. Essential to an experience of the thesis is a concurrent reading of the Special Enclosures???a schematic chronology of Sydney gay saunas, plans of Sydney and architectural plans of its saunas.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gays</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Gay clubs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20732</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Learning and discovery in incremental knowledge acquisition</field><field name="creator">Suryanto, Hendra, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Knowledge Based Systems (KBS) have been actively investigated since the early period of AI. There are four common methods of building expert systems: modeling approaches, programming approaches, case-based approaches and machine-learning approaches. One particular technique is Ripple Down Rules (RDR) which may be classified as an incremental case-based approach. Knowledge needs to be acquired from experts in the context of individual cases viewed by them. In the RDR framework, the expert adds a new rule based on the context of an individual case. This task is simple and only affects the expert???s workflow minimally. The rule added fixes an incorrect interpretation made by the KBS but with minimal impact on the KBS's previous correct performance. This provides incremental improvement. Despite these strengths of RDR, there are some limitations including rule redundancy, lack of intermediate features and lack of models. This thesis addresses these RDR limitations by applying automatic learning algorithms to reorganize the knowledge base, to learn intermediate features and possibly to discover domain models. The redundancy problem occurs because rules created in particular contexts which should have more general application. We address this limitation by reorganizing the knowledge base and removing redundant rules. Removal of redundant rules should also reduce the number of future knowledge acquisition sessions. Intermediate features improve modularity, because the expert can deal with features in groups rather than individually. In addition to the manual creation of intermediate features for RDR, we propose the automated discovery of intermediate features to speed up the knowledge acquisition process by generalizing existing rules. Finally, the Ripple Down Rules approach facilitates rapid knowledge acquisition as it can be initialized with a minimal ontology. Despite minimal modeling, we propose that a more developed knowledge model can be extracted from an existing RDR KBS. This may be useful in using RDR KBS for other applications. The most useful of these three developments was the automated discovery of intermediate features. This made a significant difference to the number of knowledge acquisition sessions required.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="subject">Knowledge acquisition (Expert systems)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20744</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biology of Arabian Gulf sailfish</field><field name="creator">Hoolihan, John Paul Jr., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Biological and life history characteristics for a previously unstudied population of sailfish, Istiophorus platypterus, in the Arabian Gulf were investigated. Notable findings include temporal-spatial migration patterns for a genetically isolated population that is threatened by overexploitation. Conventional tagging resulted in 2053 releases and 114 recaptures (5.55%) inside the Gulf. Linear displacement ranged from 2.5 to 697 km, while days at liberty ranged from 17 to 818 days. Dead recoveries in Iranian gillnets account for 88.6% of recaptures. Modeling analyses produced a best estimate of annual survival probability (S) at 0.375 (slope = -0.101, SE = 0.324). Fifteen pop-up satellite archival tags were deployed on sailfish during 2001 - 2002 to track temporal and spatial movements. Extensive data from four tags showed 83.7% of time-at-depth was spent above 10 m with no significant difference (P &amp;lt 0.05) in diel preference. Depth ranged from 0.0 m to 61.0 m, while temperature ranged from 19.7 ??C to 30.1 ??C. Small-scale movements of eight sailfish were measured using ultrasonic tracking for periods ranging from 3:33 to 53:06 hours. Track distances ranged from 5.5 to 78.5 km, while linear displacement ranged from 4.6 to 37.0 km. Average speed ranged from 0.29 to 0.75 m s-1. Vertical distributions showed 84.3% of time was spent above 10 m depth, even though water temperature showed negligible variation with depth. Mitochondrial DNA comparison of 147 sailfish produced 39 composite haplotypes using eight restriction enzymes. Significant differences occurred in the frequency between population groups inside and outside the Gulf (amova 34.8%, P &amp;lt 0.01; FST = 0.356), along with evidence of restricted migration between them (average number of migrants, Nm = 0.903). Nine year classes (0-8) were determined from aging analysis of fin spines. Females (n = 50) ranged from 0 to 8 years, while males (n = 34) ranged from 0 to 6 years. Von Bertalanffy growth function indicated rapid growth during the first two years, after which males stabilized and females continued growing to a greater maximum mean length and weight. A comparison of allometric growth between sexes indicated no significant difference between length and other morphometric characters (P ranged 0.135 ??? 0.980).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">billfish</field><field name="subject">sailfish</field><field name="subject">Istiophorus platypterus</field><field name="subject">Arabian Gulf</field><field name="subject">tagging</field><field name="subject">pop-up satellite tagging</field><field name="subject">ultrasonic tracking</field><field name="subject">genetic analyses</field><field name="subject">phylogeography</field><field name="subject">age and growth</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20755</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Significance, the vessel and the domestic</field><field name="creator">Brown, Sandra Lois, School of Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">Throughout history, people have made or acquired vessels from which to sip their favourite beverage.  In the contemporary domestic setting, households frequently accumulate multiples of the same type of object in numbers that are considerably greater than is necessary and practical for use alone.  Of these many objects there are often individual pieces that have special significance for the owner or user. Some are so valued that they may even be removed and set aside because of their perceived importance.   The research was initiated by a previous study of tea drinking vessels coupled with a desire, as an object maker and collector, to find out why people have special items that they designate as personally important. The aim was to identify how significance could be recognised in specific objects and whether the notion that a group of features used to gauge such objects could be conveyed into studio based work.  The research outcomes are evidenced in a text-based document (which articulates the theoretical and empirical elements of the enquiry) and a body of creative studio work developed in response to aspects of the investigation.  The document encompasses two components of the study. The first references material from the fields of museum and cultural studies, pivotal in focusing the enquiry.  This contributed to the compilation of a general and speculative inventory of qualities that might pertain to objects deemed ???significant???. During these early investigations it became evident that a more in depth and contemporary analysis of significant drinking vessels, their owners and/or users was required.  A Survey Questionnaire regarding personal use and special drinking vessels preceded a series of Interviews with a selected group of Australia curators, artists, academics and collectors who discussed and analysed their association with a personally significant drinking vessel.  Subsequently, the content of these interviews became central to the focus of the research and outcomes. The research isolates a number of attributes that are commonly identified in objects that, whatever their condition, are deemed ???significant???.  These describe the maker, usage, ownership, association and historical context.  The perceived value or worth of the object for its owner, is recognised as a consequence of significance and declares the object as distinctive. This outcome is clearly validated by the interviews.  The studio work develops from the fusion of personal narrative that has been enhanced by findings of the research.  In particular, it references the cherished object, most especially those pieces that have been retained despite the ravages of time and use. The resulting work was exhibited as Trace Elements ???

Vibrational modes of a submarine hull are excited from the transmission of fluctuating forces through the shaft and thrust bearings due to the propeller rotating in an unsteady fluid. The focus of this work is to investigate the structural and acoustic responses of a submarine hull under axial excitation. The submarine hull is modelled as a cylindrical shell with internal bulkheads and ring stiffeners. The cylindrical shell is closed by truncated conical shells, which in turn are closed at each end using circular plates. The entire structure is submerged in a heavy fluid medium. The structural responses of the submerged vessel are calculated by solving the cylindrical shell equations of motion using a wave approach and the conical shell equations with a power series solution. The displacement normal to the surface of the structure in contact with the fluid medium was calculated by assembling the boundary/continuity matrix. The far field radiated sound pressure was then calculated by means of the Helmholtz integral. Results from the analytical model are compared with computational results from a fully coupled finite element/boundary element model. The individual and combined effects of the various influencing factors, corresponding to the ring stiffeners, bulkheads, conical end closures and fluid loading, on the structural and acoustic responses are characterised by examining the contribution by the circumferential modes. It is shown that equally spaced internal bulkheads generate a periodic structure thus creating a grouping effect for the higher circumferential modes, but do not have strong influence on the sound radiation. Stiffeners are found to have an important effect on both the dynamic and acoustic responses of the hull. The contribution of the conical end closures on the radiated sound pressure for the lowest circumferential mode numbers is also clearly observed. This work shows the importance of the bending modes when evaluating the sound pressure radiated by a submarine under harmonic excitation from the propulsion system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shells</field><field name="subject">Submarine</field><field name="subject">Vibrations</field><field name="subject">Fluid-structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Conical shell</field><field name="subject">Cylindrical shell</field><field name="subject">Coupled shells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Baroque???n roll: the installation</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Alyson, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">My research explores contemporary painting's assertion of itself in a post-media present characterised by a diminished focus on the properties of any singular medium, and a movement toward a freedom to expand the passages and exchanges between them. Circumstances, a conjunction of technological change and a shift in attitudes, require a general recontexturalisation of painting that accommodates its evolving relationship to the photograph, the screen and the lens. This paper engages with historical matters. As the expanded exhibition project Baroque 'n Roll mimes or lip-syncs a historical period, the research drags the paradigm established in most conventional retellings of the Classical Greek Myths, specifically that of Robert Graves by referring to chapters as "books".  Everything old is new again. The past is nothing but a previous present and the expanded painting installation project Baroque n' Roll attempts to re-connect the viewer with the classical traditions that still significantly inform the nutrient-bed of contemporary culture.  The framework of the research draws a parallel between the banality of the suburban Australian sprawl with the excesses of the hyper-commercialised retail enterprises and uber-monolithic shopping enclaves like the Westfield conglomerate and the sumptuous, over-the-top decadence of the 17th Century Baroque.  In the exhibition Baroque 'n Roll; Mise en scene pastiches tropes in contemporary painting, architecture, performance and technology, by creating an installation space within the gallery which drags the Frick Collection's Fragonard Room found in New York. The purpose of the room is to frame a series of oil paintings located in a style imitative of painting from the baroque period. In this sense Baroque 'n Roll "covers" a past aesthetic used to allegorise the continued relevance of painting in the face of evolving technology while drawing a connection between the wealth and decadence of the 17th Century French Court and the imitation wealth and decadence of the "Hungary Jack parklands of suburban Australia".</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42786</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Creating space for young people, dialogue and decision making : youth justice conferencing in New South Wales Australia.</field><field name="creator">Bolitho, Jane Johnman, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Juvenile justiceAdministration ofNew South Wales.Juvenile delinquentsRehabilitationThis study examines the process of Youth Justice Conferencing in New South Wales within the context of the theory and aims of the restorative justice movement.  Analysis of relevant literature and theory suggests that restorative justice is a broad and encompassing movement that entails a decision making process where victims, communities and offenders come together in a joint response to an offence.  Although this breadth has allowed and encouraged a proliferation of programs that respond to particular needs and particular demands of culture and social context, the consequence is that both understandings and practices of restorative justices are variable.  When theoretical understandings are so varied there will necessarily be a lack of commonality in the way principles are articulated.  If practice is not linked directly to principled theory it is inevitable that processes will be vulnerable at all levels to the interaction between context, situations and participant characteristics that may easily deflect the focus from the true purpose of restorative justice.  This thesis attempts to clarify the restorative principles relevant to the NSW program with reference to Braithwaite and Pettit???s republican theory (1990) and their notion of dominion.  In turn these principles are used to identify five practical elements to be used as a framework to guide youth conferences.  Such a framework highlights potential areas for improvement in conference preparation and practice.  A case study approach was used to collect data and involved the observation of eighty five Youth Justice Conferences in three New South Wales conferencing regions. As well, one hundred and fifty two currently practising Youth Justice Conferencing practitioners (Police, Conveners, Managers) in New South Wales completed a mail out questionnaire.  Findings from the study suggest that conference processes are influenced by the presence or absence of five particular elements: the attendance of victims, the attendance of communities, the attendance of offender support, reparation to victims, communities and offenders and the experience of non-domination during the conference space.  However, findings also suggest that ???situational??? factors may mediate these key elements to enhance or compromise the overall process.  This thesis suggests that many of the issues arising in NSW conferences result from the failure to articulate the links between restorative justice theory and practice. While in NSW such links may intentionally have been unarticulated in order to encourage a freedom within the process, in reality the lack of clarification has led to a freedom in discretion that sometimes diminishes the chance of success.  Therefore it proposes the need for a more articulated translation of theory into principles that will in turn frame practice.  In this way the thesis uses the normative theory proposed by Braithwaite and Pettit (1990) to provide an explanatory and ideal framework for best practice in NSW Youth Justice Conferencing.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">youth justice conferencing</field><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="subject">young offenders</field><field name="subject">criminal justice</field><field name="subject">Juvenile justice</field><field name="subject">Administration of</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Juvenile delinquents</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20780</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phylogeography, population history and conservation genetics of the endangered green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea)</field><field name="creator">Burns, Emma Louise, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) is an Australian hylid, which was once common with a relatively continuous distribution. Historically, this distribution extended from northern New South Wales (NSW), as far as Ballina, to East Gippsland in Victoria; with inland populations as far west as Bathurst and Tumut.  Today the species is reported to have disappeared from 80% of its former range and remaining populations are mostly fragmented and typically restricted to the coastline, extending from Yuraygir National Park (northern NSW) to East Gippsland.  In this thesis, I report a comprehensive study designed to identify the phylogeographic and conservation genetic parameters of L. aurea. In doing so, I also investigate evolutionary relationships within the ???bell frog??? species group. In this study, microsatellite and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers are employed.  The development of species-specific microsatellite markers and the collection of samples was a substantial component of the study.  These markers and samples should prove useful for future studies of L. aurea and perhaps more generally the ???bell frogs???. Initially, a large-scale assessment of genetic structure and diversity in L. aurea using microsatellite markers was undertaken. Twenty-one locations were sampled from throughout the species range covering 1000 kilometres of the east coast of Australia.  Levels of allelic diversity and heterozygosity were high (uncorrected mean alleles/locus and HE: 4.8-8.8 and 0.43-0.8 respectively) compared to other amphibian species and significant differences among sampled sites were recorded.  Despite recent population declines, no sites displayed a genetic signature indicative of a population bottleneck.  Significant genetic structuring (overall FST = 0.172) was detected throughout the species range, but was relatively low compared to previous amphibian studies that used microsatellites. In addition, some areas sampled within continuous habitat showed evidence of weak genetic structuring (data subset FST = 0.034). Next, relationships among extant bell frogs (Litoria aurea species-group) were investigated, using mitochondrial ND4 nucleotide sequence data.  Analyses supported a clade comprised of the temperate members of the species-group, L. aurea, L. cyclorhyncha, L. moorei, and L. raniformis but failed to support the inclusion of the tropical bell frog L. dahlii in this group.  Relationships among the four members of the bell frog clade correlated with geographical distribution: the south-western Australian bell frogs (L. cyclorhyncha, L. moorei) and the south-eastern Australian bell frogs (L. aurea, L. raniformis) were reciprocally monophyletic.  Results also indicated that divergence of these two lineages occurred during the late Miocene, which was consistent with results of previous studies and with more general assertions that much of the major differentiation and radiation of the Australian biota predated the Quaternary. Following this, intraspecific phylogeography of L. aurea using two mitochondrial genes COI and ND4 was investigated. I examined extant populations from throughout the species??? range, sequencing 263 individuals from twenty-six locations.  Recent evolutionary history, as well as the current population structure of L. aurea, was inferred from the resulting pattern of genetic variation amongst haplotypes, in conjunction with demographic and population analyses.  Results indicated that there were no phylogeographic divisions within L. aurea, despite a general consensus that amphibians are highly structured.  However, I did still detect significant structure amongst extant populations (FST = 0.385).  Overall, patterns of haplotype relatedness, high haplotypic diversity (mean h = 0.547) relative to low nucleotide diversity (mean Pi= 0.003), and mismatch distribution analysis supported a Pleistocene expansion hypothesis with continued restricted dispersal and gene flow. Taken together, the results of this thesis indicate that L. aurea is a species with relatively weak population and phylogeographic structure compared to other amphibians.  The data provide no support for the existence of distinct evolutionary lineages within L. aurea, implying that there are no historically isolated populations that should be viewed as separate evolutionarily significant units.  Nevertheless, remaining populations are still significantly structured but not all populations are genetically distinct. Low phylogeographic structure, coupled with evidence for recent gene flow among many sites would permit ???well managed??? intervention to mediate gene flow amongst currently isolated populations, and I provide some guidelines for the implementation of such conservation strategies.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that supplementation through artificial immigration is at this time necessary given current levels of genetic variation within populations.  In the short-term, conservation management in L. aurea should focus on the protection of local populations and habitat to promote population connectivity to ensure processes that maintain adaptive diversity and evolutionary potential are conserved.  Preservation of the species??? natural range and the maintenance of dense networks of suitable habitat, in conjunction with maximising local carrying capacity and reproductive output, as well as minimising known threats, are key to securing the long-term persistence of the green and golden bell frog.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Litoria aurea</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Frogs.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20774</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interrupted ageing of Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys</field><field name="creator">Buha, Joka, School of Materials Science &amp; engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis systematically investigates the effects of a recently developed modified ageing procedure of aluminium alloys, termed the T6I6 temper, on the microstructural development and mechanical properties of the Al ??? Mg ??? Si - Cu alloy 6061. For the T6I6 temper, a conventional single stage T6 temper is interrupted by an ageing period at a reduced temperature (65??C) to facilitate secondary precipitation, before resuming the final ageing at the temperature of the initial T6 treatment. The T6I6 temper was found to cause simultaneous increases in tensile properties, hardness, and toughness as compared with 6061 T6.  Al ??? Mg ??? Si ??? Cu alloys are medium strength alloys widely used in the automotive industry and their further improvement is underpinned by stringent demands for weight reduction placed on the transportation industry in recent years. The potential for further improvement of the mechanical properties was found in the control of secondary precipitation that may take place even in some fully aged alloys when exposed to reduced temperatures.  The overall improvement in the mechanical properties of 6061 T6I6 was attributed to the formation of finer and more densely dispersed precipitates in the final microstructure. The refinement of precipitates was facilitated by control of the precipitation processes and gradual evolution of the microstructure throughout each stage of the T6I6 treatment. The results indicated that the concentration and the chemical environment of the vacancies controlled the precipitation processes in this alloy. Findings also show that the proportion of the different precipitate phases present in the final microstructure, as well as the amount of the solute in these precipitates, can be controlled and modified utilizing secondary precipitation.  A number of analytical techniques were used in this study. The evolution of the microstructure was studied using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), High Resolution TEM (HRTEM) and Three Dimensional Atom Probe (3DAP). Vacancy-solute interactions were studied using Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS) and 3DAP. The distribution of the solute was studied using 3DAP and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to identify precipitation reactions and to determine the stability of vacancy-associated aggregates.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">aluminium alloys</field><field name="subject">Al-Mg-Si-Cu alloys</field><field name="subject">AA6061</field><field name="subject">precipitation hardeninig</field><field name="subject">secondary precipitation</field><field name="subject">interrupted ageing</field><field name="subject">T6I6</field><field name="subject">nanostructural characterisation</field><field name="subject">mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">TEM</field><field name="subject">3DAP</field><field name="subject">PALS</field><field name="subject">NMR</field><field name="subject">DSC</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Factors which affect refractive outcome following LASIK for myopia.</field><field name="creator">Feltham, Mark Hayes, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Purpose: To improve the predictability, accuracy and stability of laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK), by evaluating the clinical, procedural and tissue response factors that affect refractive outcomes. Methods: Myopic LASIK surgeries (n=5,978) were carried out using the Technolas planoscan and Nidek EC-5000 excimer lasers. Clinical variables associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target were identified using regression analysis. Possible procedural variations such as the timing of the procedure and accuracy of both the chosen keratome and excimer laser were evaluated. The predictability and accuracy of the ablation was assessed by measuring changes in corneal thickness during and after the procedure. Factors influencing the stability of refractive outcome were assessed. Results: Clinical factors associated with a refractive outcome of within ??0.50 D of the target included; corrections less than 5.00 DS (OR 0.21x, 95% CI 0.11-0.40x compared with corrections over -5.00 DS[referent]), patients younger than 40 years (patients over 50 OR 8.27x, 95% CI 3.41-20.03x, patients 40 to 50 years OR 1.93x, 95% CI 0.96-3.90x, compared with patients under 40[referent]) and average pre-operative curvatures between 43.50 and 45.50D (OR 0.39x, 95% CI 0.18-0.83 compared with curvatures of less than 43.50D [referent]). Refractive stability was improved using optic zone sizes between 5.5-6.0 mm, reduced myopic corrections, flatter pre-operative corneal curvatures and thicker corneal flaps (R??=25%, p&amp;lt0.001). Procedural factors associated with poorer outcomes included: thinner measured flap thickness, deeper ablations and the use of the automated corneal shaper (ACS) microkeratome with a novice surgical team (R??=34%, p &amp;lt 0.001). Delaying the ablation from 20 to 90 seconds (s) after flap lift was associated with a more stable refractive outcome at three months (p=0.017). In the 90 s following flap lift, the cornea thinned by 5??3%. The ablation rate per scan varied between procedures, however, the effect on refractive outcome was small (r=0.15, p=0.267). Changes in central corneal thickness indicated refractive stability (p=0.039). Conclusions: Applying the optimal clinical and procedural factors as described afforded a refractive outcome in a further 8% of cases, resulting in 94% to 96% of cases within ??0.50 DS of target. Refractive predictability was limited due to the inability of the keratome to produce a consistent corneal flap thickness and unexpected changes in corneal thickness. The accuracy of refractive outcome will decrease with larger ablations. The degree of refractive inaccuracy with high refractive corrections (&amp;gt -10.00 D) can be over 1.00 D.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">LASIK (Eye surgery)</field><field name="subject">Myopia</field><field name="subject">Eye</field><field name="subject">Refractive errors</field><field name="subject">laser in-situ keratomileusis</field><field name="subject">Eye surgery</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Artificial vision: feasibility of an episcleral retinal prosthesis &amp; implications of neuroplasticity</field><field name="creator">Siu, Timothy Lok Tin, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background. A visual prosthesis is a conceptual device designed to activate residual functional neurons in the visual pathway of blind individuals to produce artificial vision. Such device, when applied to stimulate the vitreous surface of the retina, has proven feasible in producing patterned light perception in blind individuals suffering from dystrophic diseases of the retina, such as aged-related macular degeneration (AMD). However the practicality of such approach has been challenged by the difficulty of surgical access and the risks of damaging the neuroretina. Positioning a visual implant over the scleral surface of the eye could present a safer alternative but this stimulation modality has not been tested in diseased retinas. Additionally, recent research has shown that the adult neocortex retains substantial plasticity following a disruption to its visual input and the potential deterioration in visual capabilities as a result of such experience modification may undermine the overall bionic rescue strategy. Methods. Two animal models mimicking the principal pathologies found in AMD, namely photoreceptor degeneration and reduced retinal ganglion cell mass, were used to evaluate the efficacy of trans-scleral stimulation of the retina by recording electrical evoked potentials in the visual cortex. The visual performance following the loss of pattern vision induced by bilateral eyelid suturing in adult mice was examined by analysing visual evoked potentials. Findings. Spatially differentiated cortical activations were obtained notwithstanding the underlying retinopathy in the experiment animals. The charge density thresholds were found to be similar to controls and below the bioelectric safety limit. After prolonged visual deprivation (weeks) in the mouse, the visual cortical responses evoked by either electrical or photic stimuli were both significantly reduced. An assessment of different visual capabilities using patterned stimuli demonstrated that whilst visual acuity and motion sensitivity were preserved, significant depression in luminance and contrast sensitivities was detected. Conclusion. Trans-scleral stimulation of the retina is a feasible approach for the development of a visual prosthesis. Following visual loss the adult brain exhibits significant experience-dependent modifications. These new insights may force a revision on the current bionic rescue strategy.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Evoked potential</field><field name="subject">Visual prosthesis</field><field name="subject">Neural plasticity</field><field name="subject">Visual deprivation</field><field name="subject">Rabbit</field><field name="subject">Mouse</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42879</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Microbiological quality assurance in a wine bottling operation</field><field name="creator">Jones, Iain, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wines after packaging may undergo microbial spoilage, especially by yeasts. The risk of such spoilage can be minimized by preventing microbial contamination during packaging operations. This thesis describes wine packaging operations and the quality management initiatives required to control microbial contamination during packaging. Control of microbiological quality during packaging needs to be implemented without compromising overall wine quality and its appeal to consumers. The need for rapid, convenient methods to examine yeasts in packaged wine and to assess the hygiene status of wine packaging equipment was identified.  The commercially available MicroFoss assay, based on optical measurement of metabolic activity, was evaluated as a rapid method for detecting spoilage yeasts in packaged wine. The method was optimised to enable detection of low levels of yeasts (1 cfu/200 ml of wine), and eliminate interference from wine acidity. More than three hundred wine samples taken immediately after packaging in a large commercial winery were examined for yeasts by the optimized MicroFoss assay and the standard membrane plate culture method. The samples represented red and white wines taken over 15 months and exhibited yeast counts of 0-1 000cfu/200ml. The semi-automated Micro Foss assay reliably detected the presence of yeasts in the samples (correlation coefficient 0.89 with standard method) and gave data within 40 hours. Studies using wines inoculated with pure cultures of specific spoilage yeasts (eg. Zygosaccharomyces bailii) revealed a limitation of MicroFoss in detecting slow growing yeasts.  The Biotrace ATP-bioluminescence assay was evaluated as a rapid, convenient method to asses the efficacy of cleaning and  sanitation of wine packaging equipment. Approximately 900 samples were examined and met pre-determined assay units as a measure of hygiene status. Data on surface cleanliness were obtained within two minutes. In some samples, residues of biocidal cleaning agents interfered with the assay, giving false positive data.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42881</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biosynthesis of abscisic acid in plants</field><field name="creator">Milborrow, Barry Vaughan, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">PhD by publication.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Plant hormone.</field><field name="subject">Biosynthesis.</field><field name="subject">Abscisic acid.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42883</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Diamond-shaped 2-dimentional digital FIR filters with high performance and low complexity</field><field name="creator">Fanian, Kaveh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">2-D digital filters have found numerous applications in signal processing and their design is subject to intensive research. In general, these filters are divided into two types: Separable filters as a product of two 1-D filters, and Non-Separable filters. Separable filters are easier to design but work mostly for rectangular-shaped frequency spectrums. On the other hand, non-separable filters are preferred for designing other shapes of spectrum divisions such as diamond-shaped, circular-shaped, fan-shaped, etc. but their design is much more complicated.  When designing 2-D filters, there are several important issues which should be considered. These issues are: the accuracy of the pass-band and the transition-band, the pass-band ripple, the stop-band attenuation and the complexity of the filter for its digital implementation.  One important class of 2-D filters is the class of 2-D digital filters with Four-Fold symmetry. Despite the fact that these filters can be designed by using some kind of McClellan transform and yet admit fast digital implementation, the shape of their pass-band cannot be easily controlled. The accuracy of the description of the pass-band shape requires a high-order polynomial transformation, but such a transformation leads to the explosive growth of the filter order and its implementation complexity.  While there exist some known approaches that can control the pass-band shape more efficiently, they all suffer from the fact that their transition-band should be wide enough to avoid possible singularities that may arise due to the interpolation step.  In this study, the semi-definite programming as a tool, is adopted to design non-separable four-fold symmetric 2-D digital filters and it will be shown that unlike previously proposed semi-definite programming based approaches, this approach is advantageous due to the facts that all the filter specifications are met while interpolation is avoided, the dimension of the semi-definite programming formulation is kept moderate, and moreover, the designed filters admit fast digital implementation despite the fact that they are non-separable and are not designed based on 1-D filters. The simulation clearly confirms the viability of this approach.  Finally, although only diamond-shaped filters are considered in this study, other filters such as circular-shaped, elliptic-shaped or fan-shaped are expected to be designed in a similar fashion.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42898</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Central and peripheral nerve excitability: developing an understanding of the pathophysiology of neurological disease</field><field name="creator">Kiernan , Matthew C. , Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">PhD by publication.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pathophysiology.</field><field name="subject">Neurological disease.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological therapies for the restoration of degenerated intervertebral discs</field><field name="creator">Wei, Ai-Qun, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Low back pain is a common cause of disability and work inability, often associated with intervertebral disc degeneration. The current understanding of disc degeneration is limited and none of the available treatments is entirely effective. The work described herein investigates potential strategies for the biological herapeutic restoration of disc degeneration.  Firstly, an in vitro study to investigate the effects of BMP-7 on human discal cellular viability was performed. Cultured cells were treated with TNF-a or H202 to induce apoptosis, resulting in the down regulation of extracellular matrix proteins, decreased cell viability, morphological changes and activation of caspase-3; however, addition of BMP-7 alone prevented the observed effects, demonstrating the ability of BMP-7 to prevent apoptosis of human disc cells in vitro.  Secondly, the differentiation potential of stem cells towards disc-like cells was studied. Rodent mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs) were cultured alone or co-cultured with rat disc tissue. Differentiation potential of rMSCs was evaluated by mRNA and protein expression, cellular function and morphological studies. The co-culture conditions led to the expression of chondrocytic markers in rMSCs, whereas rMSCs cultured alone did not express the chondrocytic markers. Cellular contact between the co-cultured rMSCs and the discal tissue were observed. This study demonstrated that rMSCs can differentiate into functional disc-like cells in a tissue influenced co-culture environment.  Finally, the survival and differentiation of CD34+  or CD34?? bone marrow (hBM) cells, in an intra-discal xenogeneic transplantation rat model was investigated. Human CD34+ or CD34?? cells were isolated, fluorescent-labelled and injected into rat coccygeal discs. The survival of transplanted cells was confirmed by fluorescent positive cells as well as a human nuclear specific marker. Interestingly, CD34?? cells survived until day 42 in the injected discs, and differentiated into cells ex:pressing a chondrocytic phenotype. In contrast, CD34+  cells could not be detected by day 21. This data suggests that transplanted hBM CD34??  cells, in contrast to CD34+  cells, were able to survive and differentiate within the intervertebral disc. Together, the results of these studies can both encourage and contribute to the basis of potential biological therapies in the restoration of intervertebral disc degeneration.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human bone marrow (hBM) cells.</field><field name="subject">Disc degeneration.</field><field name="subject">Rodent mesenchymal stem cells (rMSCs)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/42968</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proteolytic enzymes in grass pollen and their relationship to allergenic proteins</field><field name="creator">Saldanha, Rohit Gregory, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Pollen grains are ubiquitous triggers of allergic asthma and seasonal rhinitis. Proteolytic enzymes in pollen as well as other sources are capable of disrupting airway epithelial integrity in vivo and in vitro. This provides a plausible mechanism for the initiation of sensitisation of the respiratory immune system to inhaled pollen allergens, comparable to that suggested for Group 1 allergens from house dust mites and cat dander, which are known to possess intrinsic proteolytic activity. This thesis explores the relationship between pollen allergens and proteolytic enzymes. It describes the different strategies used for the characterisation, purification and identification of immunogenic and proteolytic proteins in the complex mixtures of pollen diffusates. The peptidases in the diffusates of Kentucky blue grass, ryegrass and Bermuda grass pollens were characterised by a sensitive fluorescence assay and gelatin zymography. Among these, Bermuda grass pollen demonstrated the presence of a serine peptidase at Mr ~30,000 Da, which corresponded to an intense band by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to the timothy grass (Phleum pratense) group 1 allergen, Phl p 1. Purification of this enzyme from Bermuda grass was complicated by the low levels of the enzyme present in the diffusate, as well as by its autohydrolysis. Partial purification of the serine peptidase activity by affinity chromatography using Concanavalin A Sepharose demonstrated that the diffusate contained a trypsin-like peptidase, detected by the fluorescent assay, in addition to the ~30,000 Da serine endopeptidase, detected on gelatin zymography. Proteomic analysis of the ~30,000 Da protein using one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry identified it as the major pollen allergen of Bermuda grass, Cyn d 1. The studies reported here provide, for the first time, evidence that a pollen allergen may possess intrinsic proteolytic activity. This activity may play a role in the initiation of airway inflammation and allergic sensitisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Proteolytic enzymes</field><field name="subject">Allergens</field><field name="subject">Pollen.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20824</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Moving house: the renovation of the everyday</field><field name="creator">Dawson,  Louisa, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper describes my research project and body of work, which investigates social inequalities through the different language and functions of everyday objects.  The research moves on from my previous Honours research project on the dou ble nature of caravan parks in NSW and looked at the changing demographics of these locations. I noted the increase of semi-permanent, residential 'homes' for low income earners and the unemployed, in these holiday locations.  This paper examines broader social issues of homelessness and social inequalities within our society. I look at the complexities in the definitions of homelessness and the ways in which people find themselves in the position where they rely on welfare agencies and government support. I also investigate different representations of homelessness by artists and other social commentators, ranging from the hopeless victim to the vagrant. This section locates my social concerns with the context of theoretical debate and artistic representation.  I have used everyday and mundane objects in my artworks to discuss these social concerns. Everyday objects posses a language and commonality that is familiar to all members of society. This language is developed from the different historical, cultural and functional qualities that everyday objects possess. I discus this in relation to the development of the everyday object in artistic practices from the early 20th century to today. Of specifically importance to my practice is the influence of contemporary German artists and their manipulation of objects to make works with political and social content.  Throughout this paper I have discussed individual art works which illustrate my social concerns and the practicalities of the everyday. Revealing how I juxtapose certain objects to question the uneven nature of travel and home, with regards to possessions and mobility. Additionally I challenge the normal functions of objects to reveal new absurd possibilities of use.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Poor in art.</field><field name="subject">Dawson, Louisa -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="subject">Homeless persons in art .</field><field name="subject">Marginality, Social, in art.</field><field name="subject">Assemblage (Art)</field><field name="subject">Found objects (Art)</field><field name="subject">Sculpture, Modern -- 20th century -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="subject">Sculpture, Modern -- 21st century -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43084</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combat modelling with partial differential equations</field><field name="creator">Keane, Therese Alison, Mathematics &amp; Statistics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Part I of this thesis we extend the Lanchester Ordinary Differential Equations and construct a new physically meaningful set of partial differential equations with the aim of more realistically representing soldier dynamics in order to enable a deeper understanding of the nature of conflict. Spatial force movement and troop interaction components are represented with both local and non-local terms, using techniques developed in biological aggregation modelling. A highly accurate flux limiter numerical method ensuring positivity and mass conservation is used, addressing the difficulties of inadequate methods used in previous research. We are able to reproduce crucial behaviour such as the emergence of cohesive density profiles and troop regrouping after suffering losses in both one and two dimensions which has not been previously achieved in continuous combat modelling. In Part II, we reproduce for the first time apparently complex cellular automaton behaviour with simple partial differential equations, providing an alternate mechanism through which to analyse this behaviour. Our PDE model easily explains behaviour observed in selected scenarios of the cellular automaton wargame ISAAC without resorting to anthropomorphisation of autonomous 'agents'. The insinuation that agents have a reasoning and planning ability is replaced with a deterministic numerical approximation which encapsulates basic motivational factors and demonstrates a variety of spatial behaviours approximating the mean behaviour of the ISAAC scenarios. All scenarios presented here highlight the dangers associated with attributing intelligent reasoning to behaviour shown, when this can be explained quite simply through the effects of the terms in our equations. A continuum of forces is able to behave in a manner similar to a collection of individual autonomous agents, and shows decentralised self-organisation and adaptation of tactics to suit a variety of combat situations. We illustrate the ability of our model to incorporate new tactics through the example of introducing a density tactic, and suggest areas for further research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lanchester</field><field name="subject">Partial differential equation</field><field name="subject">Combat</field><field name="subject">Numerical methods</field><field name="subject">Modelling</field><field name="subject">Predator-prey</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43086</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Legal and professional challenges confronting practising lawyers in contemporary Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Thi Minh, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The policy of developing a market economy and of international integration as well as the major impetus to seek to build a law-based state and engage in judicial reform, are bringing practising lawyers (luat su) in Vietnam more opportunities than ever before, and the role of luat su is much improved. Given the importance of luat su in the period of transformation, attention should be paid to the enormous challenges encountered by them, as they are affected by a number of issues involving cultural, social, and legal aspects. This thesis tries to identify the professional and legal challenges that luat su face which directly and specifically affect their role: notably widespread devaluing of the potential and role of law, and the role of luat su in society, the inappropriate attitude of some government officials towards practising lawyers, the inadequacy of many lawyers' qualifications, the inferior position of luat su in the judicial system, the use of 'connections' (quan he) as a substitute for legal services, and especially substantial degree of inconsistencies, overlapping, uncertainty and unpredictability of the legal system, which prevent luat su from being able to render useful and practical advice. There is a causal relation between those issues and the marginal role of practising lawyers in contemporary Vietnam.  This study also uses comparisons to draw experiences from other countries to see whether their experience can be made use of in Vietnam, The thesis makes a number of recommendations and concludes that in order to overcome difficulties and to improve the role of lawyers it is critical to create a good infrastructure for lawyers, including ensuring a closer approach to the rule of law in practice, Lawyers do not live and function in their own isolated world, but closely relate to the operation of other organs administering law and exercising justice. It is therefore concluded that the degree of improvement in the legal profession largely depends not only on the reform of the legal profession itself, but also on the success or failure of the current judicial and legal reforms.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Practising lawyers in Vietnam.</field><field name="subject">Lawyers (luat su)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44503</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From laughing at the world to living in the world</field><field name="creator">Hojdyssek, Gunter, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Born in 1938 in Poland, I epxperienced wartime Berlin and post-war Stalinism.

Brecht's play 'Mutter Courage and her children' and Georg Buechner's 'Woyzech' encapsulated the harsh realities of post-war Europe, and confirmed my desire for social justice and reform.  Yet, the main influence on my work comes from my own life experience. My life in Australia has become a kind of exile-a deprivation of the origin of my culture and my cradle. After nearly forty years in Australia I feel a little displaced. Yet I left Europe voluntarily to escape from the very culture and history I now miss. I am experiencing a common dilemma of migration. I belong neither here nor there-a kind of dislocation. There exists a twilight zone in the in-between time-a discontinuity of my Berliner development. Artists such as Kaethe Kollwitz, John Heartfield, George Grosz, Otto Dix, and Max Beckman influenced my teenage years. Later, Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer and Georg Baselitz. I work with found objects, such as toys crafted by human hand. I am giving them a new meaning, a new being. They are meditations on the conflict of war, where women and children are the primary victims of political fragmentation. My sculptures evoke memories of a childhood stolen. They take on a menacing character reminding the viewer of the effects war has on humanity.  But Art is the reflector and searcher; it is our way to enlightenment. Joseph Beuys introduced the concept of an expanded notion of art ("der erweiterte Kunstbegriff???) to surpass the boundaries of modernism with in art, science, spirituality, humanism and economics.

Along with those changes, industry risks have also been transformed significantly. Prior to restructuring, government-owned or carefully regulated monopoly private utilities would manage most of these industry risks. With restructuring, however, both the government, through their market regulators, and industry participants need to manage a range of previous,, yet also now new, risks. While the government???s risk management strategy is focused on the industry as a whole, participants are naturally more concerned with their individual risks. The Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) is one of the many electricity markets that were formed through the restructuring process underway worldwide. It created a number of new types of market participants facing different sets of risks. The main objective of this thesis is to examine the management of market risk by these different NEM participants. The methodology used in the thesis involves developing a fundamental understanding of electricity restructuring, the NEM and the various risks faced by the different NEM participants. Data on NEM spot prices, ancillary costs and forward prices are analysed to gain a better understanding of its relationship with market activities. Different risk management strategies, both proactive and reactive, that can be taken by the participants are discussed This thesis has highlighted some of the complexities involved in managing risks in a restructured electricity industry. Risks are never static and changes in market conditions alter the risk exposure of the participants. Therefore, participants will need to constantly monitor their risk exposure and update their risk management strategies. The Cash-Flow-at-Risk methodology is introduced as a possible tool to measure risk and analyse risk management options for different NEM participants.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electric power</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Electric utilities</field><field name="subject">Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20834</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mathematical modelling of bacterial quorum sensing and biofilm formation</field><field name="creator">Fagerlind, Magnus, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">To date, bacterial resistance to antibiotics is an increasing problem and there is a growing appreciation that biofilm formation is a significant contributor to antibiotic resistance. This has led to .increased research on ways to reduce/control biofilm formation. One such target is bacterial cell-cell communication that allows bacteria to coordinate gene expression, and that has been shown to be involved in biofilm formation and production of virulence factors. By interfering with this communication system it should be possible to control gene expression and thus inhibit production of virulence factors as well as the formation of biofilms. However, these processes are multi-factorial, which make it a very complicated task to experimentally identify key parameters that subsequently could guide the development of cell-cell communication strategies to control bacterial virulence and biofilm formation. However, by using mathematical modelling, it is possible to study complex processes and to identify those parameters that are most important for these processes.  The focus of this thesis was to develop mathematical models of bacterial cell-cell communication systems and biofilm formation to identify key parameters that could subsequently guide the development of cell-cell communication strategies to control bacterial virulence and biofilm formation.  It was found that the cell-cell communication system in the model bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa works by hysteretic switching between two stable steady states, reflecting low and high rates of signal production, respectively. It was also shown that this bacterium uses different regulators to adjust the cell density required for switching the system on or off. Moreover, it was also demonstrated that signal antagonists have the capacity to switch the system from an induced state to the lower, uninduced state. However, it was also shown that this blocking behaviour is extremely dependent on the properties of the AHL antagonists, since even very small differences could greatly affect the outcome. Finally, accumulation of damage was predicted to be the main cause of cell death during the formation of biofilms. In addition, a strong relationship between nutrient availability and damage accumulation (and consequently cell death) was also found.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation static liquefaction of lightly cemented sands</field><field name="creator">Elhadayri, Farj, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An experimental investigation was conducted on the static liquefaction  behaviour of very loose lightly cemented sands. Undrained and drained triaxial compression tests, one dimensional consolidation, high stress compression, and unconfined compression tests were performed on artificially prepared lightly cemented loose samples with cement-sand ratios of 2, 4 and 6%. Additional tests were also conducted on uncemented samples prepared at the same initial void ratio as the cemented samples. Besides the influence of degree of cementation, the effects of void ratio and confining pressure on the liquefaction potential of cemented sands were examined. The aim of this study is to make significant contribution to the understanding of static liquefaction failures in lightly cemented sands. It is shown that cementation could increase the initial stiffness and yield strength of cemented sands but its effect might decrease considerably after the peak strength because of destruction of the cementation bond. The response of cemented sands at lower cement contents was very similar to the response of loose sands and behaviour approached the response of medium to dense sands with increase in the degree of cementation. It is also shown that degree of cementation has a significant influence on liquefaction resistance. Even though the presence of small amounts of cementation did not prevent liquefaction failure, the liquefaction resistance of cemented sands generally increased for higher degrees of cementation.  The consolidation, high stress compression and unconfined compression tests demonstrated the effect of cementation in increasing both the stiffness and strength of cemented sands. The unconfined compression strength increased approximately linearly with the increase in cement content. The rate of strength gain increased with an increase in the dry density of the compacted sample, indicating that the cementation was more for denser samples.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">cementation.</field><field name="subject">cemented sands.</field><field name="subject">liquefaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43104</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tributaries: public art, connecting &amp; reflecting people and place</field><field name="creator">Martini, Nerine Yvette, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tributaries are geographic fingers of water moving across the landscape making connections with a main water source. As a title for my Master of Fine Arts research paper this metaphorically refers to the political, social and cultural streams which are expressed through my public artworks. It is also a poetic play on notions of paying tribute.  This research examines the process of collaboration and cross-cultural arts practice and the relationship between a public artwork, the site and the audience. Four diverse yet interrelated public art projects are presented for my Master of Fine Arts degree. This research investigates the conceptual links between the four projects and the current discourse of cross-cultural collaborations. Although my art practice varies in location, materials, forms and approach, generally it is focussed around sculpture and installation and includes temporary and permanent public artworks. Two of the projects discussed took place in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, the other two took place in Vietnam.  This research discusses the advantages, disadvantages and challenges in choosing to work collaboratively and questions the relationship of the author to the work and the importance of the process in creating an artwork. It also explores notions of hierarchy and power relationships that occur between artists from within the same culture and between artists from different cultures.   Exploring the connections between public art and specific communities/sites has expanded my research into related notions of homes, homelessness and displacement. My approach to public sculpture is deliberately anti-monumental. This takes into account the relationship of scale within a public artwork: including the relationship of the work to the human body and to the surrounding environment I examine how contemporary public art can serve as a form of tribute to historic events and people of the past. My poetic approach to creating public art differs from more conventional monuments and statues of tribute and can be considered as a non-linear approach to presenting history. While the events these artworks refer to have taken place in the past, the issues surrounding them continue to have relevance to political situations of today.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public art</field><field name="subject">Community</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44425</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neurotensin and its receptors in human isolated intestine in health and disease : focus on motility aspects</field><field name="creator">Azriel, Yael, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neurotensin (NT) is a brain-gut peptide, localised to mucosal endocrine N-cells in the gastrointestinal tract. The most potent stimuli for NT release are ingested fats. NT, in vivo, inhibits the migrating myoelectric complex and stimulates colonic motility. The aim of this thesis was to investigate NT and its receptors in human isolated intestine, focusing on motility aspects. ???Normal??? colon and ileum were obtained from patients undergoing resection for carcinoma, and ???disease??? colon was obtained from patients undergoing resection for ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn???s disease (CD), diverticular disease (DD) and slow transit constipation (STC). In functional experiments with ???normal??? ascending and sigmoid colon, NT contracted taenia coli strips by direct mechanisms (EC50 ??? 100 nM). In circular muscle (CM) strips, contractions were mediated by NT-induced release of enteric mediators (indirect actions), which were regionally specific, as well as by direct actions on the smooth muscle. In contrast, in ???normal??? terminal ileum, the predominant action of NT was a potent (EC50 ??? 3 nM), directly mediated inhibition of spontaneous contractions in longitudinal muscle strips. NT receptors were characterised using radioligand binding with [125I]-NT and [3H]-NT, and localised using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. In the sigmoid colon, binding sites corresponded to NTS1 receptors and could be visualised on the smooth muscle and the enteric ganglia, supporting both direct and neuronal actions for NT, respectively. In the ileum, a similar distribution of binding sites could be visualised. In gastrointestinal disease, NT contractile responses were reduced in UC, DD and STC colon CM strips, but were unchanged in CD. In contrast, NT responses in all diseases were largely unchanged in TC strips, suggesting disease/treatment-induced alterations in NT mechanisms. In UC, cholinergic mechanisms appeared to be altered, whereas in DD disease, prostaglandin mechanisms were affected. In STC, there was an apparent loss of a normally predominant component in NT-mechanisms, but contractile mechanisms appeared to be retained. In summary, these studies demonstrated regional and muscle layer specific actions and mechanisms of action for NT, and support alterations in enteric signaling in disease.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neurotensin</field><field name="subject">Intestines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20828</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The kinematics and dynamics of cross-hemispheric flow in the Central and Eastern Equatorial Pacific</field><field name="creator">Brown, Jaclyn Nicole, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis concerns two topics: the kinematics of Pacific cross-equatorial flow ??? the location, timing and magnitude of the flow; and their dynamics???what are the driving forces controlling the flow? Despite extensive observations in the central and eastern Pacific, observations of these flows remain contradictory. We use output from an Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) viewed from a Lagrangian framework on density layers. This addresses the problem of high variability due to features such as Tropical Instability Waves.   The annual mean flow is found to be southward nearly everywhere, east of 140??W. Flow becomes stronger in the second half of the year due to a bolus transport of very light surface water, introduced by Tropical Instability Waves. A Tropical Cell pattern occurs along the equator that does not require diapycnal downwelling.   From 160??E to 160??W the annual mean flow is northward, occurring mostly in the mixed layer, appearing to originate partly from the Equatorial Undercurrent surfacing in the east. The northward flow is strongest in March and becomes southward in September.   The wind stress and nonlinear terms are shown to be the key driving features, with a prescribed biharmonic Smagorinsky horizontal friction scheme having negligible impact. From 160??E to 160??W, the flow is partly accounted for by an Ekman forcing, with the curl of the nonlinear term providing a crucial additional torque, more than doubling the magnitude in some instances. From 160??W to 120??W the wind stress curl provides a weak southward flow of about 1 Sv, which increases by the nonlinear addition to around 5 Sv.   The curl of the steady component of the nonlinear term, derived from annual mean currents, is similar in structure to the total nonlinear term, but higher in magnitude. The structure of the variable term, which was mostly of opposite sign to the steady term, suggests damping occurs in place of friction.   While our study is limited to an examination of the model's characteristics, our results provide important clues to the observed flow patterns not resolved by present-day measurements. This study also highlights the importance of time-space variability and both horizontal and vertical density structure in controlling the flow and its feedback on the system.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ocean circulation</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Lagrange equations</field><field name="subject">Pacific Area</field><field name="subject">Climate.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20831</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phantom in the corner: staging a gothic spectacle</field><field name="creator">Banyard, Kylie Jane, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">My research proposes an analytical engagement with the central functions of Phantasmagoria and the Wunderkammer, namely atmosphere and display.

I have incorporated words into my recent work in a variety of ways including drawing, Letraset, sound and fiction writing. The philosophical questions which arise through any use of language and the various ways of adopting these questions and words within a 'visual art' context is considered in a number of ways. These include The Voyager Interstellar Space Mission which was humankind's first attempt to communicate with other hypothesized populations, conceptual word-incorporating artists, writers of fiction and philosophers within whose work can readily be found an extreme vigilance towards language.  Alongside this word exploration I will consider other processes through which I've made and continue to make, works of art. These processes include drawing and film/video. My drawings (which sometimes include words) will be addressed in terms of a crossover between the drawn line and words found in Raymond Carver's story Cathedral. This story made me think about what it means to 'be led' by somebody and how I'm led (by myself or perhaps those mysterious 'populations' the Voyager team of thinkers had in mind) when drawing. It also marks an interesting point in my discussion of a state of being 'without words.'  In addition to words an important focus in this paper are the windows through which I've spent a lot of 'my life' looking at 'life pass by' (which are in many ways a physical reality corresponding to the metaphorical 'frame of language'). The time I've spent looking out windows over the past few years has resulted in. several film and video pieces in addition to my latest work (presented as the appendix of this paper) which comprises of a series of short stories.  The paper opens with a quote by German philosopher Martin Heidegger: "Language is the house of Being. In its home man dwells."

A number of studies have investigated the impact of service recovery efforts (compensation, speed of response, etc.) on post-recovery satisfaction, mostly in Western countries. However, despite the importance of global markets, very few have examined how Eastern consumers react to service recovery efforts. Furthermore, none have examined the impact of cultural value orientation (cultural values measured at the individual level) in implementing effective service recovery programs. This is one of the few studies that have attempted to avoid the ecological fallacy, i.e., assume all consumers within a country are culturally homogeneous. Based on Justice Theory, this research conducted in Thailand, employed an experimental design to investigate how customer evaluations of service recovery efforts are influenced by interplay of the consumer???s cultural value orientation and service recovery attributes (apology, compensation, cognitive control, recovery initiation, and formality). The results reveal that cultural values of power distance, uncertainty avoidance and collectivism do indeed interact with a firm???s recovery tactics to influence perceptions of justice. In other words, the impact of a firm???s tactics is culturally dependent, and consumer expectations and perceptions of service recovery efforts vary, depending on customers??? cultural value orientation. Finally, all three forms of justice (distributive, procedural, interactional) along with disconfirmation of expectations, positively impact on overall service recovery satisfaction.  Unlike previous studies, we found evidence to indicate that there is a temporal sequence associated with the three justice dimensions i.e., interactional and procedural justice precede and thus impact perception of distributive (outcome) justice. The results have implication for marketing theory as well as managerial action.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">service recovery</field><field name="subject">service failure</field><field name="subject">cultural values</field><field name="subject">satisfaction</field><field name="subject">justice theory</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Customer services</field><field name="subject">Cross-cultural orientation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20837</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Photocatalytic reduction of cadmium and selenium ions and the deposition of cadmium selenide</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nu Hoai Vi, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis, which can oxidise or reduce organic and inorganic pollutants, is a developing technology for water and wastewater treatment. The current work investigates the photocatalytic reduction of cadmium and selenium species as the presence of these elements in water are of environmental concern. Although TiO2 has been widely used for the photocatalytic process, its light absorption is limited to the UV region of the solar spectrum. Hence, the current project also explores the possibility to deposit cadmium selenide (CdSe) onto TiO2 to extend the photoresponse to the visible region. This study demonstrated that cadmium (Cd(II)) could be reduced to its metallic form by photocatalysis. The choice of hole scavengers and reaction pH are of importance in determining whether the photocatalytic reduction reaction will occur. It is also essential that both Cd(II) and organic additives are adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. A mechanism for cadmium photoreduction in the presence of formate as the hole scavenger was proposed. The current investigation elucidated the mechanism for the photoreduction of selenite (Se(IV)). Selenite was found to be photoreduced to its elemental form (Se(0)) as films, by direct photoreduction of Se(IV), and as discrete particles, by the reaction between Se(IV) and selenide (Se(2-)) ions. The Se(2-) ions are believed to have been generated from the 6 electron photoreduction of Se(IV) and/or the further photoreduction of the Se(0) deposits. Photocatalytic reduction reactions of Se(IV) and selenate (Se(VI)) using different commercial TiO2 materials was also studied. The current work also successfully deposited CdSe by photocatalysis using Se-TiO2 obtained from the photoreduction of Se(IV) and Se(VI). The mechanism for CdSe deposition was clarified and attributed to the reaction of Cd(II) present in the system and the Se(2-) released from the reduction of Se(0) upon further illumination. The Se??TiO2 photocatalysts obtained from the photoreduction of different selenium precursors (Se(IV) and Se(VI)) resulted in the dominance of different morphologies of the CdSe particles. This suggests a new approach to manipulate the properties of CdSe during its formation, and hence control over electrical and optical properties of this semiconductor.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cadmium selenide</field><field name="subject">Photocatalysis</field><field name="subject">Selenium</field><field name="subject">Cadmium.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20849</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of calcineurin in high-renin and low-renin animal models of pressure overload left ventricular hypertrophy</field><field name="creator">Benson, Victoria Louise, St Vincent's Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in response to pressure overload is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, making its prevention an important therapeutic goal. The role of a calcineurin-dependent molecular pathway in the induction of pressure-overload LVH is controversial. The present study tested the hypothesis that, in the setting of LV pressure overload, activation of the systemic renin-angiotensin system was necessary for activation of this calcineurin pathway. Mild LV pressure overload was induced in male Wistar rats by abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) or transverse aortic arch constriction (TAC), producing well-matched pressure gradients of 37 ?? 8 and 35 ?? 15 mmHg, respectively. Tight transverse aortic arch constriction (TTAC) in additional animals produced a pressure gradient of 75 ?? 15 mmHg. Only AAC increased plasma renin concentration and activated the calcineurin pathway, indicated by increased nuclear NFAT3 content. Plasma renin concentration and nuclear NFAT3 content were unchanged in TAC and TTAC animals. AAC animals developed more LVH 21 days post-banding than TAC and TTAC animals: the slope of the relationship between LV/body weight ratio and systolic blood pressure was much steeper in AAC animals than the combined TAC and TTAC animals (20x10-6 versus 5x10-6, p&lt;0.001). Treatment with the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 did not significantly alter the slope of this relationship in the combined TAC and TTAC animals (8x10-6), but FK506 abolished this relationship in AAC animals (-5x10-6, R =0.0003). These data indicate that activation of the calcineurin pathway occurs only in high-renin hypertension, providing an additional stimulus to LVH induction. Calcineurin plays no role in the induction of LVH in low-renin hypertension, which is much more common clinically.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heart</field><field name="subject">Hypertrophy</field><field name="subject">Renin.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20843</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Palaeontology of primitive wombats</field><field name="creator">Brewer, Philippa, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Wombats (Vombatidae, Marsupialia) are fossorial marsupials that are most closely related to koalas amongst living marsupials. The cheek teeth of wombats are unique amongst Australian marsupials in being hypselodont (the condition where the teeth continue to grow throughout life and the formation of roots is suppressed). Hypselodonty is an adaptation to high degrees of tooth wear. The fossil record of vombatids is largely restricted to Pliocene to recent deposits and is largely represented by isolated teeth. Six genera are currently recognised from these deposits, all of which have hypselodont teeth. To date, a single isolated vombatid tooth has been described from pre-Pliocene deposits of South Australia and is the only example of a vombatid cheek tooth that possesses roots.  Seventy specimens, representing five species of vombatid, have been recovered from Oligo-Miocene deposits in the Riversleigh World Heritage Site in northwestern Queensland and are described here. Among these are four new species and one new genus. A new species of  Warendja from Riversleigh is described. It represents the oldest known hypselodont vombatid. This species is compared with additional specimens of the Pleistocene species of Warendja (W wakefieldi). Three species of Rhizophascolonus and a new monotypic genus are also described. Phylogenetic analysis of these taxa indicates that Rhizophascolonus may represent a sister taxon to the other vombatids. These specimens comprise almost all known examples of Oligo-Miocene vombatids. Most of the specimens are isolated teeth and are highly variable in size and morphology. Cusp detail is clearly preserved on many, allowing for omparison with the cusp morphology on juvenile cheek teeth of the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus).  All of the taxa found in the deposits at Riversleigh share a number of characters such as marked differences in enamel thickness and height around the cheek teeth. It is argued here that these shared characters are indicative of high amounts of tooth wear and/or occlusal stresses acting on the trailing edge enamel. Combined with evidence of scratch-digging adaptations of the forelimbs it is suggestive of a rhizophagous niche for at least some of these early vombatids.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hypselodonty.</field><field name="subject">Wombats (Vombatidae, Marsupialia)</field><field name="subject">Fossorial marsupials.</field><field name="subject">Riversleigh World Heritage Site.</field><field name="subject">Morphology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43156</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Measurements of optical turbulence on the Antarctic Plateau and their impact on astronomical observations.</field><field name="creator">Travouilon, Tony, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Atmospheric turbulence results taken on the Antarctic plateau are presented in this thesis. Covering two high sites: South Pole and Dome C, this work describes their seeing and meteorological conditions. Using an acoustic sounder to study the turbulence profile of the first kilo- metre of the atmosphere and a Differential Image Motion Monitor (DIMM) to investigate the integrated seeing we are able to deduce important at- mospheric parameters such as the Fried parameter (r0) and the isoplanatic angle (??0). It was found that at the two sites, the free atmosphere (above the first kilometer) was extremely stable and contributed between 0.2" and 0.3" of the total seeing with no evidence of jet or vortex peaks of strong turbulence. The boundary layer turbulence is what differentiates the two sites. Located on the Western flank of the plateau, the South Pole is prone to katabatic winds. Dome C on the other hand is on a local maximum of the plateau and the wind conditions are amongst the calmest in the world. Also linked to the topography is the vertical extent of the temperature in- version that is required to create optical turbulence. At the South Pole the inversion reaches 300 m and only 30 m at Dome C. This difference results in relatively poor seeing conditions at the South Pole (1.8") and excellent at Dome C (0.27"). The strong correlation between the seeing and the ground layer meteorological conditions indicates that even better seeing could be found at Dome A, the highest point of the plateau. Having most of the turbulence near the ground is also incredibly ad- vantageous for adaptive optics. The isoplanatic angle is respectively 3.3" and 5.7" for the South Pole and Dome C. This is significantly larger than at temperate sites where the average isoplanatic angle rarely exceeds 2". This means that wider fields can be corrected without the complication of conjugation to specific layers. For such purpose the potential is even more interesting. We show that ground conjugated adaptive optics would decrease the natural seeing to 0.22" for a wide field of 10 and 0.47" for a field of 1" at the South Pole. At Dome C the results are less impressive due to the already excellent seeing, but a gain of 0.1&amp;quote can still be achieved over 1&amp;quote. These results show that high angular resolution observations can be done better on the Antarctic plateau than any other known site.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Astrophysics</field><field name="subject">atmospheric turbulence</field><field name="subject">site testing</field><field name="subject">Antarctica</field><field name="subject">Observations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/20852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Functional characterisation of the HIV-1 glycoprotein-41 cytoplasmic tail</field><field name="creator">Edmonds, Judith Helen, Clinical School - St Vincent's Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The unusually long Cytoplasmic tail (CT) of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (HIV-1) glycoprotein-41 (gp41) is highly conserved and engineered large truncations often render the virus non-infectious in a cell-type dependent manner. While large CT truncations occur infrequently in natural isolates, little is known about the mechanisms involved in infectious virions harbouring a large CT truncation.     This thesis characterises RFgp34, a replication competent laboratory HIV-1 isolate with an acquired 100 amino acid CT truncation, and how it diverged from wildtype RF. The CT truncation and two possible compensatory mutations in Matrix (E40K and F44I) were introduced into the HIV-1 isolate NL4-3. These mutants were tested for infectivity, syncytia formation and glycoprotein incorporation into virions, alternative co-receptor usage and sensitivity to the fusion inhibitor T-20.  Compared with RFwt, RFgp34-infected cultures displayed delayed viral replication kinetics in all cell types. Similar sized (MT-4 cells, PBMC) or larger and more numerous syncytia (Hut78 cells) were detected in RFgp34-infected cultures. Similar (Hut78 cells) or decreased (MT-4 cells, PBMC) amounts of glycoprotein was incorporated into RFgp34 virions, compared with RFwt virions. The increased syncytia in RFgp34-infected Hut78 cultures and the reduced glycoprotein incorporation into RFgp34 virions from MT-4 cells and PBMCs may explain the delayed RFgp34 replication kinetics.     The Matrix E40K and F44I mutations were not able to directly compensate for the CT truncation to restore infectivity in Hut78 and MT-4 cells, as secondary mutations or the reversion of the CT truncation to a full-length CT were observed. In PBMCs the Matrix mutations alone were able to partially restore infectivity, suggesting specific mutations may compensate for the CT truncation in different cell types.  None of the viruses utilised alternative HIV-1 co-receptors, nor were more resistant to T-20 than wildtype HIV-1 suggesting that the CT does not directly play a role in these viral functions.   This thesis suggests that the sequence of mutations acquired by RFgp34 to compensate for the CT truncation and restore infectivity in multiple cell types may have occurred in a specific order and the evolution of RFgp34 to out-compete RFwt occurred over many passages.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">HIV-1.</field><field name="subject">Glycoprotein-41.</field><field name="subject">Cytoplasmic tail.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44099</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mutated in colorectal cancer (MCC): a putative tumour suppressor gene in colorectal cancer</field><field name="creator">Sigglekow, Nicholas David, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant burden in contemporary society due to an aging population, unhealthy dietary choices and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle. While the underlying defects for many hereditary forms of CRC have been determined, many genetic and epigenetic changes promoting common sporadic CRCs have yet to be identified. The Mutated in Colorectal Cancer (MCC) gene, identified in 1991, was initially thought to be responsible for the hereditary form of CRC, familial adenomatous polyposis, before the discovery of the susceptibility gene Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC), which then became the focus of intense research. Recent data, however, suggests that MCC may also be important in the development of CRC. I have investigated the mechanism of MCC gene silencing, the putative structure, and multiple functions of MCC.  MCC was frequently silenced by promoter hypermethylation in CRC cell lines and primary tumours. MCC methylation showed strong molecular and clinicopathological associations with hallmarks of the serrated neoplasia pathway. Furthermore, MCC methylation was more frequent in serrated precursor lesions compared with adenomas, thus occurring early during carcinogenesis.  MCC is highly conserved in complex multicellular organisms. Re-introduction of MCC in CRC cell lines resulted in partial G1 to S phase, and G2/M phase cell cycle blocks, potentially by upregulating cell cycle inhibitor gene transcription and interfering with the process of mitotic checkpoints and division, respectively. Changes in MCC levels also modulated NF?B pathway signalling, the pathway required for maintaining cell viability and proliferation in colonic epithelial cells. In particular, MCC overexpression suppressed both TNF? and LPS-induced NF?B activation, decreasing both the magnitude and rate of cellular responses. Overexpression also resulted in downregulation of proteins involved in canonical NF?B pathway signalling, while increasing the transcription of non-canonical NF?B genes. Therefore, MCC may direct activation of this pathway to a specific subset of NF?B-regulated genes. These data provide a molecular basis for the role of MCC as a tumour suppressor gene in CRC. MCC may have multiple functions, regulating cell cycle progression and modulating NF?B pathway signalling, either through direct involvement in pathway signalling cascades, or by providing a scaffold on which signalling events can occur.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Tumour suppressor.</field><field name="subject">Mutated in colorectal cancer.</field><field name="subject">MCC.</field><field name="subject">Promoter hypermethylation.</field><field name="subject">Colon cancer.</field><field name="subject">NF-kappaB.</field><field name="subject">Cell cycle.</field><field name="subject">G1/S block.</field><field name="subject">G2/M block.</field><field name="subject">Serrated neoplasia pathway.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43617</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The negative chargeability of clays</field><field name="creator">Brandes, Ian Marcus, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Coastal clay deposits are an increasingly important focus of environmental and geotechnical studies, and to date, geophysical techniques for mapping them have almost exclusively relied on bulk conductivity measurements. However, direct correlation of bulk conductivity data is difficult, as it is a non-unique parameter. A potential alternative geophysical mapping tool is the complex conductivity technique, where both in-phase and out-of-phase conductivity are measured concurrently. Using similar principles, the induced polarisation field technique measures the charge polarisation parameter chargeability. Studies that utilise these techniques have almost exclusively concentrated on the charge polarisation properties of sediments with low clay contents, and these sediments have intuitively credible positive chargeability values. However, the few studies that include high-clay-content sediments ??? like those encountered in coastal clay deposits ??? have often reported negative chargeabilities. No mechanism has been presented that accounts for this effect. Similar negative chargeability effects have been noted in other sciences, but often remain unexplained. Negative chargeability is shown here to be a non-linear property of clay gels ??? unique to sediments with bulk membrane properties and a potential new clay mapping parameter. A new clay polarisation model is presented which accounts for negative chargeability. Clay sediments are considered as a clay gel membrane, as opposed to traditional models ??? of clay zones within a solid substrate. In the revised model, non-linear ionic gradients occur within the sample, due to the bulk membrane properties of clay gels. Charge dispersion is described in terms of anomalous diffusion Warburg impedances, which create currents in the opposite sense to the applied potential. Negative chargeability is then a unique feature of sediments with bulk membrane properties. Laboratory electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data are presented. The experimental data covers a variety of clay types at a variety of water contents. For pure clay samples, negative chargeability is shown to occur when the clay???s water content is such that it is in a gel state. The threshold water content is shown to be a function of the clay???s liquid limit. This trend is more complicated for natural clays. Field measurements of negative chargeability are presented. The Conductivity Cone Penetrometer (CCPT) is utilised as a chargeability-logging tool at a field site at Hexham, New South Wales. In the first study of its kind, negative chargeability CCPT logging is shown to be effective in mapping a coastal clay deposit.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clays</field><field name="subject">Analysis.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Boron tribromide sourced boron diffusions for silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Slade, Alexander Mason, Electrical Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis undertakes the development, characterization and optimization of boron diffusion for silicon solar cells.  Heavy diffusions (sheet resistance &lt; 40 Ohm/square) to form a back surface field, and light diffusions (sheet resistance &gt; 100 Ohm/square) to form oxide-passivated emitters were developed.  Test structures and solar cells were fabricated to assess uniformity, lifetime and recombination effects due to the light and heavy boron diffusions. It was found that the growth of a thin ~200 ??, thermal oxide, during stabilization ??? immediately prior to the boron diffusion - was required to maintain high lifetime and reduce surface recombination (reducing the emitter saturation current density) for all boron diffusions.  The heavy boron diffusion process was incorporated into the single side buried contact solar cell processing sequence.  The solar cells fabricated had both boron diffused and Al/Si alloyed P+ regions for comparison.  This research conclusively showed that boron diffused solar cells had significantly higher open circuit voltage compared to Al/Si alloyed devices.  Fabrication of n-type solar cells, and their subsequent characterization by overlayed secondary electron image and the electron beam induced current map showed that the Al/Si alloy varied in depth from 5 to 25 micrometers deep. Methodology and characterization for light, oxide-passivated boron diffusions are also presented.  This study yielded boron diffused emitters (sheet resistance &gt; 100 Ohm/square) with low emitter saturation current.  It was observed that this was possible only when the thermal oxidation after the boron diffusion was minimal, less than 1,000 ??.  This was due to the segregation effect of boron with oxide, decreasing the surface concentration that in turn decreased the electric field repulsion of electrons from the surface.  Device modelling of n-type solar cells is presented where the parameters of the modelling include the results of the light, oxide-passivated boron diffusions.  This modelling shows n-type-base material with light oxide-passivated boron diffusion has higher potential conversion efficiency than forming a solar cell from phosphorous diffused p-type material.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">boron diffusion</field><field name="subject">BBr3</field><field name="subject">solar cell</field><field name="subject">Boron</field><field name="subject">Solar cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The central role of the designer's appreciative system in socially situated design activity</field><field name="creator">Bacic, Monique, Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">According to Dorst and Dijkhuis (1995) the two principal paradigms governing design activity discourse, are Simon's rational problem solving, and Schon's theory of design as a 'reflective conversation with the situation'. The rational problem solving view, that a fixed problem space structures design activity, has reduced the designer to a 'missing person' within design activity research (Dorst &amp; Reymen 2004). This thesis aims to highlight the agency of the designer in structuring and motivating socially situated design activity. Dorst's (2006) framework of 'design paradoxes' suggests that design problems are evolving and unknowable. Design situations are determined through the designer's reinterpretation of the social discourses underpinning design situations, in a similar way to 'problem setting' within 'reflection-in-action' (Schon 1983). While Dorst suggests interpretation relies on intuition, problem setting relies on 'professional artistry' which is 'bounded' by the 'appreciative system' (personal knowledge, values and beliefs) and is essentially 'learnable' (Schon 1983).  This thesis explores the correspondence between Schon's theory and contemporary frameworks including 'design paradoxes' (Dorst 2006), 'designerly ways of knowing' (Cross 1982), 'organising principles' (Rowe 1987), and 'creative problem construction' (Mumford et al 2004). It investigates the agency of the designer as evidenced in the use of the 'appreciative system'. This is elucidated using case study analysis of a novice designer, within a tertiary design degree. The case reveals the structured and motivated use of the designer's appreciative system. It indicates the deployment of 'appreciative goals' are fundamental to the 'linking behaviour of designers' (Dorst 2006), enabling design to begin in the absence of 'repertoire' or domain knowledge (Schon 1983), and the acquisition of new repertoire knowledge.  These emergent findings offer new pedagogical perspectives both in terms of design expertise, which is normally associated with domain knowledge, and educating domain independent, multidisciplinary designers. Frames or similar 'organising principles' operate in most design fields, and create a 'principle of relevance' for knowledge from multiple domains and disciplines (Buchanan 1992). An awareness and acknowledgement of the objective function of subjective personal and social knowledge is essential in order to locate the 'missing' designer and understand innovative design activity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Creative thinking.</field><field name="subject">Sch??n, Donald A.</field><field name="subject">Design, Industrial -- Methodology.</field><field name="subject">Design -- Psychological aspects.</field><field name="subject">Design -- Study and teaching.</field><field name="subject">Creative ability in technology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43252</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Training signal and precoder dsigns for channel estimation and symbol detection in MIMO and OFDM systems</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Nam Tran, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Research in wireless communications has been actively carried out in recent years. In order to enable a high data transmission rate, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications has been proposed and commonly adopted. Accurate channel identification and reliable data detection are major challenges in the implementation of a communications system operating over a wireless fading channel. These issues become even more challenging in MIMO systems since there are many more parameters involved in the estimation processes. This thesis, consisting of four major parts, focuses on applying convex optimization to solve design problems in both MIMO channel estimation and data detection.  The first part proposes a novel orthogonal affine precoding technique for jointly optimal channel estimation and symbol detection in a general MIMO frequency-selective fading channel. Additionally, the optimal power allocation between the data and training signals is also analytically derived. The proposed technique is shown to perform much better than other affine precoding techniques in terms of detection error probability and computational complexity.  The second part is concerned with the MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The superimposed training technique developed in the first part is applied and extended for MIMO-OFDM systems where all the involved transmitters and receivers are assumed to be uncorrelated. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed design can efficiently identify the unknown wireless channel as well as effectively recover the data symbols, while conserving the transmission bandwidth.  The third part considers training and precoding designs for OFDM under colored noise environment. The superiority of the proposed design over the previously-known design under colored noise is thoroughly demonstrated. The last part of the thesis develops the orthogonal affine precoder for spatially correlated MIMO-OFDM systems. The optimal superimposed training sequences are solved by tractable semi-definite programming. To have a better computational efficiency, two approximate design techniques are also presented. Furthermore, the non-redundancy precoder proposed in the third part is employed to combat channel correlation. As a result, the proposed designs are demonstrated to outperform other known designs in terms of channel estimation and data detection.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Precoder.</field><field name="subject">Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications.</field><field name="subject">Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.</field><field name="subject">Coloured noise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43243</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Physiological and molecular responses of the marine oligotrophic ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis Alaskensis rb2256 to visible light and ultraviolet radiation</field><field name="creator">Matallana Surget, Sabine-Astrid, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth&#146;s surface (UVR, 280-400 nm) may penetrate deep into the clear oligotrophic waters influencing a large part of the euphotic layer. Marine heterotrophic bacteria at the surface of the oceans are especially sensitive to the damaging solar radiation due to their haploid genome with little or no functional redundancy and lack of protective pigmentation. In a context of climate change and ozone depletion, it is clearly important to understand the physiology and underlying molecular UVR responses of abundant marine bacteria species. We chose the marine ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis as a reference species to study the impact of solar radiation due to its numerical abundance in oligotrophic waters and its photoresistance, previously reported. For this purpose, we focused on the formation of the two major UVB-induced DNA photoproducts (CPDs and 6-4PPs) as well as the differential protein expression under solar radiation.  We first demonstrated that the GC content of prokaryotic genome had a major effect on the formation of UVB-induced photoproducts, quantified by HPLC-MS/MS. Due to its high GC content, S. alaskensis presented a favoured formation of highly mutagenic cytosine-containing photoproducts and therefore would be more susceptible to UVinduced mutagenesis. By comparing S. alaskensis to another marine bacterium Photobacterium angustum, we observed for the latter strain a remarkable resistance to high UVB doses associated with a decrease in the rate of formation of CPDs explained by a non-conventional activity of photolyase. We also demonstrated that DNA damage in S. alaskensis was markedly modulated by growth temperature and time spent in stationary phase.  In order to assess the effects that environmental UV-R had on regulatory networks and pathways of S. alaskensis, and determine how the cell&#146;s physiology was affected, a quantitative proteomics investigation was performed. Changes in proteome were analyzed, with the recent and powerful mass spectrometry based approach using iTRAQ methodology. Approximately, one third of the proteome of S. alaskensis was identified, with 119 statistically and significantly differentially abundant proteins. Cellular processes, pathways and interaction networks were determined and gave us unique insight into the biology of UV response and adaptation of S. alaskensis.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine bacteria</field><field name="subject">UV radiation</field><field name="subject">Visible light</field><field name="subject">DNA damage</field><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43251</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traditional Vietnamese lacquering processes and their applications to contemporary jewellery and small scale body related objects</field><field name="creator">Tieu, Bic, Design Studies, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The lustre and luminous qualities inherent in lacquer objects speak of a revered historic technology chronicled by remarkable achievements. Sophisticated lacquer objects from East Asia and Vietnam are products of the integrated histories, technologies, and cultural expressions of these territories. The application of lacquer as a decorative medium originally developed in China. Through exchange and trade, the material was transmitted to neighbouring countries where each region explored the material and developed distinctive styles and techniques. Although lacquer from East Asia and Vietnam share similar material natures, the cultural attributes of lacquer, it's aesthetics, design, form, and symbolism provide for marked distinctions across the zone. Vietnamese lacquer contributes surface techniques and motifs to the lacquer repertoire. The aim of this research is to investigate the materiality and processes of Vietnamese lacquer as a surface ornamentation integral to the design and making of objects.  The published material is dominated by descriptions of the aesthetic achievements of lacquer objects with little coverage of the technology, techniques, and practices employed. There is a scarcity of contemporary research on Vietnamese lacquering processes written in the English language. This research was fuelled by a research field trip to Vietnam during 2004 workil,1g with Vietnamese lacquer artists on traditional lacquering techniques. During a residency at Hue the lacquer working processes were observed, documented and techniques sampled. This traineeship incorporated the preparation of traditional tools, of the substrate, and the application of lacquer painting techniques. Preparatory samples and templates were made in Australia for later experimentation in Vietnam. These samples were treated with lacquer and illustrate the possible exploration of Vietnamese lacquering techniques in a contemporary context.  The research is a material investigation of traditional Vietnamese lacquering processes applied to jewellery and object making. The studio practice aims to reinterpret the traditional material language of lacquer by allying it with contemporary methods and techniques. This synthesis combining traditional art methods and digital technology is expressed as a series of objects inspired by floral motifs. The seasonal floral images are significant, evoking concepts of creation and renewal. The interpretation of these graphic florals provides a contemporary representation, aesthetic, and cultural reading for the material, maker, and motif.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Jewelry making.</field><field name="subject">Lacquer and lacquering.</field><field name="subject">Lacquer and lacquering -- Vietnam.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43253</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The melodramatic imagination of Tracey Moffat's art</field><field name="creator">Daur, Uta, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis tracks the melodramatic imagination of Tracey Moffatt's art. Whereas many of Moffatt's photographic and filmic works employ conventions of melodrama, the critical literature on her art has barely engaged with this important aspect of her practice. The thesis redresses this gap. I argue that a particular understanding of melodrama that constructs inauthe.ntic and indeterminate realities crucially shapes Moffatt's art. Building on seminal works from literature and film studies, as well as psychoanalysis I develop a framework for the detailed examination of melodrama in Moffatt's art, and identify major themes, stylistic elements and fonnal conventions of melodrama that penneate her practice.  The thesis designates and investigates three major concepts associated with melodrama as applicable to Moffatt's practice. First, I propose that her art is linked to a particular melodramatic aesthetic, the aesthetic of muteness as defined by Peter Brooks. This aesthetic uses non-verbal means of expression, such as gestures, the tableau and mise-en-scene to convey emotional and narrative meaning. It also emphasises the shortcomings of verbal language in expressing inner states of being of the modem 'Western' subject. Analyses of Moffatt's photo series Something More and her film Night Cries. A Rural Tragedy demonstrate that the aesthetic of muteness not only serves to express unspeakable traumatic experiences of characters but is also linked to the artist's aim to cross media boundaries.  Second, the thesis examines Moffatt's Scarred for Life series in relation to melodrama's exposure of issues of violence and oppression in the family. I will propose that the return of the repressed and the revelation of hidden forces in melodrama may be related to Sigmund Freud's concept of the uncanny. Focussing on Scarred for Life I will examine ways in which artworks may evoke uncanny feelings in viewers.  The third key thematic investigated in the thesis is elaborated in Chapter Five, which examines a consistent ambiguity found in Moffatt's art and links it to the moral impetus of melodrama. Building on writings by psychoanalytic theorist Joan Copjec I argue that - unlike early theatrical and literary melodrama, which divides the world into clear-cut binaries of good and evil - Moffatt's melodramas construct a moral ambiguity that questions unequivocal moral' judgment~. With the example of Moffatt's photographic series Laudanum I show that this moral ambiguity challenges viewers to make their own judgments instead of automatically relying on pre-given moral and political premises.  By analysing the crucial part that melodrama plays in Moffatt's practice, this thesis not only develops a new way of interpreting the work of this important Australian artist, but also presents an understanding of melodrama as an aesthetic and a way of seeing the world that may be applied to other fonns of contemporary visual art.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aesthetics</field><field name="subject">Moffatt, Tracey</field><field name="subject">Melodrama</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43256</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Materialisations of space: phenomenological-archaeological investigations concerning the relations between the human organism, space and technology</field><field name="creator">Woelert, Peter Christian, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In my thesis I investigate the impact the conceptual domestication and material technical transformation of space and movement has had on the behaviour of the human organism and the way it relates to its environment.  In doing so l will examine the formation and structure of three non-identical yet interrelated forms of human space; rational-geometrical space, lived space, and technologically mediated space, I combine a phenomenological approach, which allows for an analysis of the horizontal relation between embodied organism and environment, with an archaeological perspective that traces the genealogy of specific symbolic and technological formations viewed in their nexus with lived, embodied behaviour.  I argue that both the process of the conceptual domestication of space, particulady in the form of what Husserl refers to as the tendency of rationalisation and technisation, as well as the concrete technological transformation of the spatial environment, come into being and develop in a comparable way, While both initially directly or indirectly presuppose the perceptual' and motor activity of the embodied human organism, their subsequent development is tendentiously characterised by a relative departure from the human body in lieu of an extra-somatic organisation and materialisation of sense and behaviour.  The implications for the behaviour of the individual human organism are ambivalent. On the one hand, the increasing uncoupling of technology and conceptual systems from human embodiment, has allowed for a rapid development of the human's overall technical and symbolic capacities, The result is an expansive material and symbolic 'humanisation' (Leroi-Gourhan) of the organism's behavioural and geographical environment. On the other hand, the very same process entails a behavioural regression with regard to the human organism's sensorimotor activity. I argue, by way of the former, that this may entail a constriction of the human organism's cognitive and imaginative capacities, potentially threatening its individuality.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phenomenological-archaeological investigations.</field><field name="subject">Human organism.</field><field name="subject">Space.</field><field name="subject">Husserl.</field><field name="subject">Leroi-Gourhan.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43258</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A new normalized EM algorithm for clustering gene expression data</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Phuong Minh, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Microarray data clustering represents a basic exploratory tool to find groups of genes exhibiting similar expression patterns or to detect relevant classes of molecular subtypes. Among a wide range of clustering approaches proposed and applied in the gene expression community to analyze microarray data, mixture model-based clustering has received much attention to its sound statistical framework and its flexibility in data modeling. However, clustering algorithms following the model-based framework suffer from two serious drawbacks. The first drawback is that the performance of these algorithms critically depends on the starting values for their iterative clustering procedures. Additionally, they are not capable of working directly with very high dimensional data sets in the sample clustering problem where the dimension of the data is up to hundreds or thousands. The thesis focuses on the two challenges and includes the following contributions:  First, the thesis introduces the statistical model of our proposed normalized Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm followed by its clustering performance analysis on a number of real microarray data sets. The normalized EM is stable even with random initializations for its EM iterative procedure. The stability of the normalized EM is demonstrated through its performance comparison with other related clustering algorithms. Furthermore, the normalized EM is the first mixture model-based clustering approach to be capable of working directly with very high dimensional microarray data sets in the sample clustering problem, where the number of genes is much larger than the number of samples. This advantage of the normalized EM is illustrated through the comparison with the unnormalized EM (The conventional EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture model-based clustering). Besides, for experimental microarray data sets with the availability of class labels of data points, an interesting property of the convergence speed of the normalized EM with respect to the radius of the hypersphere in its corresponding statistical model is uncovered.  Second, to support the performance comparison of different clusterings a new internal index is derived using fundamental concepts from information theory. This index allows the comparison of clustering approaches in which the closeness between data points is evaluated by their cosine similarity. The method for deriving this internal index can be utilized to design other new indexes for comparing clustering approaches which employ a common similarity measure.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clustering.</field><field name="subject">Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm.</field><field name="subject">Microarray data.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43261</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of reference methods and reference materials for trace level antibiotic residues in food using IDMS</field><field name="creator">Muaksang, Kittiya , Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Food additives, drugs and growth-enhancing compounds are prominent tools in the production of sufficient quantities of affordable food. Thus, food safety has become a main concern of many countries for protection of their population's health. Analytical chemical measurements are increasingly important to ensure consumer protection, particularly in the field of antibiotic residues. International comparability and reliability of measurement results can be achieved by establishing and demonstrating the metrological traceability of those results to the International System of Units (SI). To ensure the metrological traceability of measurement results, reference methods and certified reference materials (CRMs) are needed. Nitrofuran antibiotic drugs used for the treatment of bacterial and protozoan infections in animals were studied in this thesis. A high accuracy reference method and an appropriate CRM for the detection of nitrofurans in prawns have been developed. A reference method for the measurement of mass fractions of nitrofuran metabolites 3-amino-5-methyl-morpholino-2-oxazolidinone (AMOZ), 3-amino-2-oxazolidinone (AOZ), semicarbazide (SEM) and 1-aminohydantoin (AHD) has been developed utilising an exact matching double isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) method. A feasibility study on a fortified reference material was carried out by preparing fortified samples containing the four nitrofuran metabolites. The stability testing results showed that the analytes in the freeze-dried matrix were more stable than in the wet form. Freeze-dried certified reference materials of nitrofurans in prawns have been produced; an incurred AOZ (CRM_P1) and incurred AOZ and fortified SEM (CRM_P2). The reference method developed was applied for the characterisation of certified reference materials for homogeneity, stability study and certification. The prepared certified reference materials were found to be homogeneous and remained stable under normal transport conditions. The measurement uncertainty of the measurement results obtained by the reference method developed was determined by thoroughly examining all possible sources of potential bias and precision effects. An initial measurement uncertainty for certified values of AOZ in both materials has also been estimated. Metrological traceability of measurement results obtained by the developed reference method and the reference value of the prepared certified reference materials has been established through the use of the traceable primary ratio method of exact matching double IDMS, the use of certified nitrofuran metabolite standards, and gravimetric preparation of samples.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reference material</field><field name="subject">Nitrofuran</field><field name="subject">Antibiotic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Simulation of stress dependent fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Shaik, Abdul Ravoof, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Naturally fractured reservoirs represent significant portion of the world's oil and gas reserves. In most of the reservoirs, fractures are important contributors to fluid flow. Thus, modeling and simulation of discrete fracture network is essential to assess responses of the reservoirs under stimulation pressure, develop the best hydraulic fracture treatments, carry out feasibility studies, design optimum production methods and improve reservoir potentials. It is also a very complicated process. Natural fractures are by nature highly heterogeneous with different size, orientation and spatial distribution. The complexity is further raised, taking into account the role of matrix, the flow interaction between matrix and fractures, the effect of production-induced stress on fluid flow. Previous works fail to balance sufficient geological complexity and excessive needs of high computational resources.  This thesis presents an innovative procedure to simulate stress-dependent fluid flow through discrete fracture network. Three numerical models (tensor, flow and deformation) are developed and coupled iteratively for this purpose. - A tensor model calculates grid based permeability tensor from discrete fracture network model, which includes individual fracture properties such as spatial distribution,    length, location and orientation. The tensor model accounts for fluid flow from the matrix to matrix and matrix to fracture. It also includes flow through connected and disconnected fractures. - An unsteady state simulation model investigates fluid flow through the fracture system and gives pressure profile, velocity profile as output. - A dual continuum deformation model studies the reservoir rock deformation and its effects on fluid flow. The geo-mechanic solution is decomposed into matrix and fracture parts that allow calculation of dynamic porosity and permeability separately.  The proposed work procedure has been validated to match nicely with analytical results. Furthermore, several case study scenarios are carried out to illustrate how it could help evaluate different aspects of reservoir performance including fracture connectivity, rock deformation, well injectivity and productivity, recovery and even distribution of fluid inside reservoir as a result of rock deformation. The case studies have proven the method to be very efficient in terms computational resources. It also eliminates most of the limitations in the previous models such as handling fracture connectivity, permeability anisotropy and change in effective stress.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Reservoirs.</field><field name="subject">Natural fractures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The "safety net" and human capital formation in Australia</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Fiona May, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores the validity of key assumptions and arguments about the nature, extent, depth, causes, and consequences of poverty that underpinned the statements and policy of the Howard Government during its decade in office. One important assumption appeared to be that an inability to afford the essentials of life plays a relatively unimportant, even negligible role in generating the low levels of human capital and school achievement exhibited by many ??poor?? parents and their children. Drawing on extensive secondary evidence from disciplines as diverse as economics, sociology, neurobiology, epidemiology and developmental psychology, the study demonstrates that these assumptions and arguments do not stand up to close empirical scrutiny. The adequacy of income support payments as a ??safety net?? from poverty, and the validity of various poverty ??lines?? are examined against the costs of obtaining the ??essentials?? that Australians believe no citizen should have to go without. This analysis reveals that the depth and prevalence of poverty in Australia is considerably more serious than has been admitted by the Howard Government and in many academic analyses. Next, the study demonstrates that the rise in so-called ??welfare dependence?? is a product of economic, rather than cultural developments; that income support ??customer?? data contradicts the claim that poverty is mostly a transitory phenomenon; and that ??work first welfare to work policies?? are not a solution to poverty, even during an economic boom. The second half of the thesis explores evidence from a variety of disciplines that suggests that the financial stress and material hardship associated with poverty have direct, indirect and cumulative impacts which commonly include compromised brain function and development and a reduced capacity for physiological and behavioural self-regulation. These consequences undermine physical and mental health, inter-personal relationships, parenting and health behaviours, learning capacities, and the development and maintenance of cognitive and non-cognitive abilities that are valued in the labour market. Contrary to the policy conclusions that flow from mis-characterisation of these consequences as symptoms of the intrinsic deficits of the poor, the multi-disciplinary evidence suggests that the real economic costs of allowing poverty to continue are likely to be higher than the costs of preventing it.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Income support</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="subject">Human capital</field><field name="subject">Child development</field><field name="subject">Education</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transaction size and effective spread: an informational relationship</field><field name="creator">Xiao, Yuewen, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The relationship between quantity traded and transaction costs has been one of the main focuses among financial scholars and practitioners. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate the informational relationship between these variables. Following insights and results of Milgrom (1981), Feldman (2004), and Feldman and Winer (2004), we use New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) data and kernel estimation methods to construct the distribution of one variable conditional on the other. We then study the information in these conditional distributions: the extent to which they are ordered by first order stochastic dominance (FOSD) and by monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP).  We find that transaction size and effective spread are statistically significantly orrelated. FOSD, a necessary condition for a "separating signaling equilibrium", holds under certain conditions. We start from two-subsample case. We choose a cut-off point in transaction size and categorize the observations with transaction sizes smaller than the cut-off point into group "low". The remaining data is classified as "high". We repeat this procedure for all possible transaction size cut-off points. It turns out that FOSD holds nowhere. However, once we eliminate transactions at the quote midpoint, the "crossings" between exchange members not specialists, FOSD holds for all the cut-off points fewer than 15800 shares. MLRP, a necessary and sufficient condition for the separating equilibrium to hold point by point of the conditional density functions, does not hold but might not be ruled out considering the error in the estimates.  We also find that large trades are not necessarily associated with large spread. Instead, it is more likely that larger trades are transacted at the quote midpoint (again, the non-specialist "crossings") than smaller trades.  Our results confirm the findings of Barclay and Warner (1993) regarding the informativeness of medium-size transactions: we identify informational relationships between mid-size transactions and spreads but not for trades at the quote midpoint and large-size transactions. That is, we identify two regimes, an informational one and a non-informational/liquidity one.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Transaction size.</field><field name="subject">First Order Stochastic Dominance (FOSD)</field><field name="subject">Monotone Likelihood Ration Property (MLRP)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Assessing the integrity of sympathetic pathways in human spinal cord injury</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rachael, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spinal cord injury can result in partial or complete loss of supraspinal control of sympathetic outflow below the lesion. Despite the importance of the sympathetic nervous system in autonomic dysreflexia and orthostatic hypotension, its integrity is not currently assessed in the clinical determination of lesion level - only motor and sensory pathways are examined. The aim of this thesis was to develop non-invasive means of assessing the integrity of sympathetic pathways following human spinal cord injury. Brief innocuous electrical stimuli applied to the forehead evoked cutaneous vasoconstrictor and sudomotor responses in the fingers and toes of able-bodied subjects, which were abolished by complete spinal lesions. Application of these same stimuli to the abdominal wall (below lesion) generated long-lasting cutaneous vasoconstriction (but not sweat release) and significant increases in blood pressure that accumulated with repeated stimuli. Moreover, the magnitude and duration of these spinal somatosympathetic reflexes did not depend on the number of impulses or duration of the sensory input, suggesting that only the initial part of the sensory barrage elicits reflex responses. This work has shown that cutaneous vascoconstriction provides a more robust measure of the integrity of sympathetic pathways than does sweat release. This was confirmed during natural stimulation of somatic afferents during vibroejaculation, which caused marked increases in blood pressure and marked cutaneous vasoconstriction but negligible sweat release below lesion. Muscle vasoconstrictor function below lesion was assessed by asking subjects to perform a maximal inspiratory breath-hold, which is known to cause a sustained activation of muscle vasoconstrictor neurones that counteracts the fall in blood pressure in able-bodied subjects. Blood pressure remained low in paraplegics and, especially, quadriplegics during this manouevre; importantly, heart rate showed a linear increase only in the spinal patients. In the absence of blood pressure measurements, the latter infers an interruption of descending muscle vasoconstrictor pathways. In conclusion, this thesis has demonstrated simple, non-invasive techniques that can be utilised to assess the function of the sympathetic nervous system in spinal cord injury, and highlighted the need to assess the injury in terms of the integrity of the sympathetic nervous system below the lesion level.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Autonomic dysreflexia</field><field name="subject">Spinal cord injury</field><field name="subject">Blood pressure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44505</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Postcranial evolution in marsupials: comparative analyses of autopodial diversity and postcranial skeletal ontogeny</field><field name="creator">Weisbecker, Vera, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Marsupial evolution and morphological diversity is traditionally viewed against the background of marsupial life history, central to which are the highly altricial neonates that actively move towards the teat. It has been suggested that this mode of birth leads to a constraint on the marsupial postcranial diversity. However, apart from phylogenetic investigations, few empirical studies have assessed diversity, patterns of adaptation, or ontogeny of the marsupial postcranium. This thesis contributes to the debate by providing diverse, large-scale empirical data on selected issues of marsupial postcranial evolution, using multidisciplinary approaches with focus on quantitative analysis. Chapter 1 provides an overview on previous research on this topic. Chapter 2 assesses the phylogenetic and functional-anatomical implications of marsupial carpal diversity. Chapter 3 is a phylogenetically informed morphometric analysis of diprotodontian manual digits, demonstrating locomotor adaptations similar to those in placentals and allowing the development of a new locomotor predictor ratio. Chapter 4 shows that functional correlates of digit proportions in Diprotodontia also exist in the placental hystricomorph rodents, which resemble Diprotodontia in ecological diversity. Chapter 5 applies the results from Chapters 2-4 to the mostly extinct diprotodontian suborder Vombatiformes, revealing functionally related parallelism in the hand of vombatiforms and kangaroos and questioning previous concepts of locomotion in early vombatiforms. Chapter 6 focuses on the evolution of marsupial syndactyly using a multidisciplinary approach including morphometrics and ossification sequence analysis. The results suggest that syndactylous digits evolve as a functional unit; syndactyly may arise through alteration of developmental patterns as suggested by ossification sequence heterochrony. Chapter 7 is a combined analysis of ossification sequences in marsupial and placental postcrania. The results suggest that the special locomotor and developmental requirements on marsupial neonates may metabolically and mechanically impact postcranial ossification patterns, delaying hindlimb development and accelerating ossification of the anterior torso. Chapter 8 summarises the research presented in this thesis and suggests directions for future work on marsupial postcranial evolution, particularly with respect to integrating information on postcranial diversity with ontogenetic work on morphogen expression patterns.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Postcranial evolution.</field><field name="subject">Marsupial.</field><field name="subject">Ontogeny.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43330</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Decision by Design - Decision Support for Antibiotic Prescribing in Critical Care</field><field name="creator">Sintchenko, Vitali, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Decision support systems (DSS) are traditionally designed to optimise the outcomes of a decision. This thesis explores how DSS design can also be driven by the optimisation of the decision process leading to the decision, and how it may enhance the human uptake and use of DSS. It identifies which tasks could be simplified by decision support, and how to build DSS that are likely to be readily adopted and so improve decision outcomes. It tests the hypotheses that: (a) The analysis of specific process attributes of a given clinical decision task, as well as the information needs of its users, improves the design of DSS and enhances systems?impact and acceptance. (b) The complexity of the decision task is the key process attribute that, in conjunction with the information seeking of users, shapes the outcome of the design process. The work is applied to the domain of antibiotic prescribing in critical care. To explore the first hypothesis, the key attributes of prescribing decisions associated with specific prescribing subtasks and different decision-makers and decision contexts are identified and then analysed. Based on our findings, an information-processing model of decision support for an antibiotic-prescribing task is proposed. The second hypothesis is addressed by applying and comparing metrics for decision complexity including minimum message length, cognitive effort assessment and clinical algorithm structure analysis to the prescribing task. A framework is developed to select clinical decision tasks that may benefit from automation, by characterizing decision support as a process of complexity reduction for users, and these ideas are tested in the context of antibiotic prescribing for ventilator-associated pneumonia. The hypotheses are then tested by applying the task complexity framework to the design of a DSS for antibiotic prescribing in critical care. A web-based experiment and a clinical trial of the DSS are described, both of which study the acceptability and effectiveness of the system and verify the usefulness of the design framework. Specifically, in a before-after controlled trial, with no difference in patient mortality or severity of presentation between the two periods, the use of the DSS was associated with statistically significant improvements in patient outcomes and a reduction in antibiotic usage. The length of stay and total consumption of antibiotics decreased respectively from 7.15 to 6.22 days (P=0.02) and from 1767 to 1458 defined daily doses/1000 patient days (P=0.04). The introduction of a hand-held computer-based DSS was associated with less administration of ???broad-spectrum?antibiotics. The relative impact of the uptake of the DSS on the prescribing quality was quantified. Clinicians chose to use guidelines for one third, and pathology data or the DSS for about two thirds of cases for which they were available to assist their prescribing decisions. When used, the DSS plus pathology data improved the agreement of decisions with those of an expert panel - from 65% to 97% (P=0.002). The impact of the DSS was more significant on prescribing decisions of higher complexity. The level of decision complexity appeared to affect the choice of decision support type. Prescribing guidelines were accessed more often for lower complexity decisions, whereas the infection risk DSS plus pathology data were preferred for decisions of higher complexity. The need for measurement of the effectiveness of a DSS in improving decisions, as well as their likely rate of adoption in the clinical environment, was demonstrated. The thesis concludes with a proposal to apply the framework described to the modelling of the DSS adoption and to include task complexity and user information seeking as determinants of the design and evaluation of clinical DSS.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Antibiotics</field><field name="subject">Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Critical care medicine.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21894</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Carbothermal synthesis of titanium oxycarbide</field><field name="creator">Dewan, Mohammad Ashikur Rahman, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of the project was to establish the rate and mechanisms of solid stage reduction of titania and ilmenite ores. The project examined carbothermal reduction of titania and various types of ilmenite ores in argon, helium, hydrogen, and their mixtures. Effect of CO in the gas atmosphere on reduction behavior of titania and primary ilmenite ore was also studied. Isothermal and non-isothermal reduction experiments were conducted in a fixed bed reactor in the high temperature furnace in the temperature range up to 1500oC. The off-gas composition in the reduction process was monitored by a CO/CO2/CH4 infrared analyser. The extent of reduction was calculated using data on gas composition and LECO oxygen analysis. Phase composition and morphology of reduced samples were studied using XRD, SEM and optical microscopy. The major findings of this project are as follows:  &#149; The reduction of titania to titanium oxycarbide occurred in the following sequence: TiO2 &#8594; Ti5O9 &#8594; Ti4O7 &#8594; Ti3O5 &#8594; Ti2O3 &#8594; (TiO-TiC) solid solution. &#149; Carbothermal reduction of ilmenite concentrates proceeded in two main stages. In the first stage pseudorutile and ilmenite were reduced to metallic iron and titania. Second stage involved the reduction of titania to titanium oxycarbide. &#149; Rate and degree of reduction of titania and ilmenite concentrates increased with increasing temperature. &#149; Reduction rate of titania and ilmenite concentrates was faster in hydrogen than in helium and argon. The difference in the reduction behavior in helium and argon was insignificant; reduction rate of ilmenite was slightly faster in helium than in argon. &#149; High rate of reduction of titania and ilmenite in hydrogen was attributed to formation of methane which facilitated mass transfer of carbon from graphite to oxide. Hydrogen was also directly involved in reduction of titania and ilmenite concentrates; hydrogen reduced pseudorutile to iron and titania. Titania was further reduced to titanium oxycarbide by carbon through methane. &#149; Increased gas flow rate slightly improved the reduction rate in hydrogen and suppressed the reduction in inert gases. &#149; Addition of CO to hydrogen and inert gases above 3 vol% suppressed the reduction process.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Helium</field><field name="subject">Carbothermal Reduction</field><field name="subject">Hydrogen</field><field name="subject">Argon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Honeycomb tructured porous films from different polymer architectures - preparation, mechanism, analysis and post-treatment</field><field name="creator">Guerrero, Maribel Hernandaz, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation studies and examines the process of formation of honeycomb structured porous films using various polymer architectures ranging from linear, comb, star polymers and a random copolymer. Four casting methods were designed and applied for the production of structured porous materials. The airflow casting technique, cold-stage casting technique, casting on water technique and emulsion casting technique all based in either direct water introduction to the system or indirect condensation from the environment showed to be viable options for casting of high quality porous materials. The control and study of the effect of environmental conditions towards the quality of the films has been examined through the design of a casting device and the use of the casting methods. Furthermore, the versatility of each of the architectures towards the production of honeycomb porous films has been studied. Highly regular honeycomb structured porous films were obtained from all the complex architectures namely comb polymers,  star polymers and the random copolymer. However, the linear polymers did not result in regular films. Moreover the quality of the films has been assessed and mathematically quantified. In addition, some mechanistic aspects of the process of formation of honeycomb structured porous films have been addressed. Variables such as the viscosity and evaporation of polymer solutions were examined. Furthermore, the precipitation behaviour of various polymer architectures was inspected. Only the polymer architectures showing a lower viscosity and late precipitation deemed highly regular films. Finally, the modification of highly regular films from a comb polymer and a random copolymer was successfully performed for the first time by grafting a thermoresponsive polymer from the RAFT groups already present in the porous material. The non-treated films showed a typical hydrophobic behaviour for a porous membrane however after the grafting, the films exhibited hydrophilic behaviour.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Porous materials.</field><field name="subject">Thin films - Analysis.</field><field name="subject">Polymers.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43341</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcription regulation of hepatotoxins microcystin and nodularin from cyanobacteria</field><field name="creator">Root, Hannah Patricia, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The role and function of hepatotoxins microcystin and nodularin produced by M.aeruginosa PCC 7806 and N. spumigena NSORlO respectively have yet to be elucidated. The mode of transcriptional regulation of these toxins, incorporating DNA binding proteins, was investigated, as an attempt to further understand the key control mechanisms acting on the toxins. The DNA binding proteins that control nitrogen and iron responsive transcription, NtcA and Fur, were identified from M. aeruginosa PCC7806 and N. spumigena NSOR10. Cloning and over-expression in E. coli was followed by mobility shift assays to determine binding characteristics of NtcA and Fur to the promoters, mcyA/D and ndaA/C, those regions that control the toxin encoding gene clusters in M. aeruginosa PCC 7806 and N. spumigena NSOR10, respectively. The results from these studies suggested a role for iron and nitrogen in the transcriptional control of microcystin and nodularin. biosynthesis. As NtcA and Fur classically act to regulate nitrogen and iron dependent genes, a link may be made to the putative function and control of microcystin and nodularin. By identifying the transcription factors NtcA and Fur in these genera, a greater understanding of the link between nutrient levels in the environment and hepatotoxin production in cyanobacteria may be possible.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Microcystin.</field><field name="subject">Hepatotoxins.</field><field name="subject">DNA binding proteins.</field><field name="subject">Nodularin.</field><field name="subject">Cyanobacteria.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Crystallization behaviour and rheological properties of a Mg-Cu-Y bulk metallic glass</field><field name="creator">G??n  , B??lent, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A repetitive low-pressure die casting technique has been developed for casting high quality Mg6SCU2SY10 bulk metallic glass (BMG) samples. Using these as-cast samples, the thermal and mechanical behaviour of the BMG in the supercooled liquid (SCL) region was investigated principally by uniaxial tensile testing, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).  Using the die casting facility, charge temperature, injection pressure and injection velocity were found to be important parameters for controlling the length, porosity and degree of crystallinity in the as-cast samples. A processing map was generated which showed that a melt temperature and casting pressure in the range 560-580&#176;C and 0.4-0.5 bar, respectively, generated the highest quality samples.  The static crystallization behaviour of the as-cast BMG was investigated in detail. It was found that the kinetics of both anisothermal and isothermal crystallization were adequately represented by a number of transformation models. Using the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov (JMAK) relation in conjunction with isothermal DSC, the Avrami exponent was found to vary from 2.2 to 2.5 with increasing annealing temperature which implies that, at high annealing temperatures, nucleation occurs at a constant rate accompanied by diffusion-controlled growth of spherical grains. A comparable Avrami exponent of 2.34 was also calculated by anisothermal DSC using the Ozawa method.  The tensile flow behaviour of the BMG was investigated over a range of strain rates (10.3to 10.1S&#8226;1) and deformation temperatures (150 to 170 QC) in the SCL region using standardized tensile test samples. It was found that, the flow stress increased rapidly to a maximum value followed by a decrease to a very low steady-state value. In the SCL region, the relationship between peak flow stress, strain rate and absolute deformation temperature was described adequately by the classic Sellars-Tegart constitutive relationship. There was also a good correlation between the Zener-Hollomon parameter, Z, and the flow characteristics of the BMG such as the transition from Newtonian to non-Newtonian flow at Z&gt;1 031 S&#8226;1 and optimum superplasticity for Z-values in the range 5 x 1030 to 5 x 1031 S&#8226;1 where tensile elongations in excess of 1400% were achieved.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bulk solids.</field><field name="subject">Glass -- Crystallization.</field><field name="subject">Metallic glasses.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43352</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Activation of unsaturated N&#926;N, C=O, and C=C bonds using complexes of ruthenium and rhodium</field><field name="creator">Page, Michael John, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes a broad range of coordination and organometallic chemistry on a series of ruthenium and rhodium complexes towards the aim of activating unsaturated N &#926; N, C=O, and C=C bonds.  The dinitrogen complex [RuTp(pzP)(N2)]BPh4 (5) (where Tp= tris(pyrazolyl)borate, and PzP= 1-(2-diphenylphosphinoethyl)pyrazole) was synthesized via displacement of the chloride ligand from the complex [RuTp(pzP)Cl] (1). It was found that N2 coordination proceeded through an unusual oxidation/reduction cycle with the Ru(III) intermediate, [RuTp(pzP)CI]BF4 (6), isolated upon reaction of 1 with AgBF4 in THF. Investigations of the coordination chemistry of the related Tp complex [RuTp(Bp)PPh3] (4) (where Bp= bis(pyrazolyl)borate), resulted in several unusual reactions occurring on the Bp chelate. Reaction of 4 with AgBF4 gave the unusual product [RuTp(BpF')PPh3] (6), which had the Bp B-hydride substituents replaced by fluoride substituents from the BF4 anion, (i.e. BpF,). Alternatively, reaction of 4 with AgOTf, or SOCb, led to the synthesis of the products [RuTp(BpoH)PPh3]OTf (34), and [RuTp(BpoH)PPh3]Cl (35), respectively, which have a single hydroxyl substituent substituted in place of the two B-hydrides to yield a highly unusual neutral borane chelate (BpOH).  A series of ruthenium tris(pyrazolyl)methane (Tpm) complexes [RuTpm(PPh3)2Cl]BPh4  (44.BPh4) 	RuTpm(PPh3CI2]	(46),         [RuTpm(PPh3)2CI]BPh4 	            (44.BPh4) [RuTpm(PPh3)(MeCN)Cl]BPh4   (50),	          [RuTpm(PPh3HMeCN)](BF4)2        (51), [RuTpm(PPh3)(MeCNh](BF4)2 (52), and [RuTpm(MeCNhCI]BPh4 (54.BPh4) were synthesized. These complexes varied in the number of labile acetonitrile ligands they contained, the net charge of the complex, and the presence or absence of strongly coordinating phosphine coligands on the complex. The influence of these properties on the catalytic activity of the complexes for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated. It was shown that the net charge and number of labile MeCN donors on the complex had little influence on the activity of the catalyst. It was also observed that the catalyst [RuTpm(MeCN)2CI]BPh4 (54.BPh4), which does not contain a strongly coordinating PPh3 ligand, would rapidly decompose during catalysis.  A series of bis(tert-butylthiomethyl)pyridyl (SNS tBU ) pincer complexes [Ru(SNStBU)(PPh3)Cb] (65), [Ru(SN StBU)(PPh3)(MeCN)CI]BPh4 (66), [Ru(SNStBU)(PPh3)(MeCN)2](BF4h (67), and [Ru(SNStBU)(MeCN)Cb] (68) were synthesized and their as catalysts for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone was investigated. The activity of these complexes for as transfer hydrogenation catalysts was shown to increase as the number of labile coligands on the complex increased, with an extremely high transfer hydrogenation activity obtained using 68. The catalytic activity of 68 is one of the fastest to be reported in the literature, achieving a superlative TOF (turnover frequency) of 87360 h- I.  The coordination of SNStBu in 66 and the related complexes [Ru(SNS (MeCN)2CI]BPh4 (70), and [Ru(SNS)(MeCN)2CI]2[??-Ag(MeCN)2]2(BF4)4(71) was observed to yield a range of different conformational isomers. These isomers were studied in detail using low temperature NMR and 20 NOESY and COSY IH_1H correlation experiments. The complex 71 was also characterized crystallographically and was shown to have an unusual tetrametallic macrocyclic structure with two [Ru(SNS)(MeCN)2C1r moieties bridged by two [Ag(MeCN)2r ions through a chloro and thioether donor group.  The hydrogenation of unsaturated olefinic bonds was achieved using a series of Rh N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) complexes of the type [Rh(L)(COD)]BPh4 (where L= and NHC-pyrazolyl chelate). A series of NHC-pyrazoly ligands (L) were synthesized that contained varying degrees of steric bulk on the pyrazolyl and NHC donor group. The influence of these steric parameters on the rhodium complex structure and activity of the complexes as catalysts for the hydrogenation of styrene was investigated. It was found that increasing the steric bulk around Rh decreased the activity of the catalyst.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rhodium.</field><field name="subject">Activation (Chemistry)</field><field name="subject">Ruthenium.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43366</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Surface engineering of hydrophilic TiO2 thin fil-applications as self-cleaning materials and for hydroxyapatite coating</field><field name="creator">Law, Woon Shin Clain, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">TiO2 films have attracted much attention because of their photoactivity and superhydrophilcity. For the superhydrophilicity studies, most research focused mainly on enhancing superhydrophilicity of Ti02 film under UV illumination. A hydrothermal-dip-coating superwetting TiO2 film was synthesised and found to preserve its superhydrophilicity up to 6 months. This non-UV superwetting TI02 film potentially opens an alternative application as bioactive layer for growing hydroxyapatite (HAP) coating, used extensively as prosthetic device medically.  In this research, a systematic study was carried out, aiming to understand and optimise the hydrophilicity and superwetting properties of Ti O2 film without UV illumination. The effect of (i) PEG concentration, (ii) film thickness and (iii) agglomerate size of TiO2 on the wettability of TiO2 film was investigated. Although the presence of PEG does affect the porosity of the film, PEG concentration does not play significant role in retaining superhydrophilicity of the film. The evidence from AFM showed that surface roughness is the key parameter to control in order to retain the superhydrophilic wetting and antifogging behavior of the synthesised films, which can be tuned by simple manipulation of the multilayer assembled of TiO2 nanoparticles through varying the film thickness and agglomerate size. A film thickness of (????140nm) yielded the optimum roughness (rms =23nm) for the creation of the best superhydrophilic wetting behavior. Thicker films smoothened the film roughness, and therefore causing detrimental effects on their superhydrophilic wetting properties. Smaller agglomerate size was also found to be important in retaining the roughness film. The photoactivity of the "non UV illuminated"superhydrophilic film was found that be comparable with a Pilkington Activ??? in degrading methyl blue.  The growth of Hydroxyapatite (HAP), synthesised via organic-inorganic hybrid method, and the mechanical stability of the HAP coating on the TiO2 films applied on titanium foil were studied. Homogenous HAP coating was found to grow only on the T O2 film with superhydrophilic properties. However the coating was of poor mechanical stability. Surface -OH was found to play an important role in aligning the phosphonate groups in HAP recursor during dip-coating.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Superhydrophilcity.</field><field name="subject">TiO2 films.</field><field name="subject">Photoactivity.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Behavioural cloning robust goal directed control</field><field name="creator">Isaac, Andrew Paul, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Behavioural cloning is a simple and effective technique for automatically and non-intrusively producing comprehensible and implementable models of human control skill. Behavioural cloning applies machine learning techniques to behavioural trace data, in a transparent manner, and has been very successful in a wide range of domains. The limitations of early behavioural cloning work are: that the clones lack goal-structure, are not robust to variation, are sensitive to the nature of the training data and often produce complicated models of the control skill. Recent behavioural cloning work has sought to address these limitations by adopting goal-structured task decompositions and combining control engineering representations with more sophisticated machine learning algorithms. These approaches have had some success but by compromising either transparency or robustness. This thesis addresses these limitations by investigating: new behavioural cloning representations, control structures, data processing techniques, machine learning algorithms, and performance estimation and testing techniques.  First a novel hierarchical decomposition of control is developed, where goal settings and the control skill to achieve them are learnt. This decomposition allows feedback control mechanisms to be combined with modular goal-achievement. Data processing limitations are addressed by developing data-driven, correlative and sampling techniques, that also inform the development of the learning algorithm. The behavioural cloning process is developed by performing experiments on simulated aircraft piloting tasks, and then the generality of the process is tested by performing experiments on simulated gantry-crane control tasks.  The performance of the behavioural cloning process was compared to existing techniques, and demonstrated a marked improvement over these methods. The system is capable of handling novel goal-settings and task structure, under high noise conditions. The ability to produce successful controllers was greatly improved by using the developed control representation, data processing and learning techniques. The models produced are compact but tend to abstract the originating control behaviour. In conclusion, the control representation and cloning process address current limitations of behavioural cloning, and produce reliable, reusable and readable clones.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning Control</field><field name="subject">Behavioural Cloning</field><field name="subject">Machine Learning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43367</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular interactions and chirality</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tuong Vi, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">- Alicyclic diols can hydrogen bond in many different ways and yield most interesting structures. In this thesis, eight C2-symmetric diols 48-50, 78, 79 and 81-83 were synthesized and their crystal structures were determined. No less than seven of these show unusual solid state behaviour: 48 and 78 are inclusion hosts; 49, 50 and 78 form doubly-stranded hydrogen-bonded ladder structures, where there is a strong preference for each strand to be homochiral; 78, 81 and 82 undergo self-resolution during recrystallization; and 83 forms chirally pure crystals (but the material is still racemic). - One of the favourable supramolecular synthons for hydroxy compounds is the (O-H)6 cycle of hydrogen bonds. When this cycle is formed by a racemic compound, its enantiomers alternate down-up-down etc. around the cycle. No case of an (O-H)6 cycle involving chirally pure hydroxy compounds is known. These observations indicate a strong preference for the (O-H)6 cycle being constructed from achiral or racemic molecules rather than from chirally pure hydroxyl compounds. Racemic (??)-48 and (??)-92 which are already known to form (O-H)6 cycles in the solid state were prepared in chirally pure form and their X-ray crystal structures determined. No (O-H)6 cycles were observed for these homochiral diols. These findings confirm that the (O-H)6 motif occurs only for achiral or racemic compounds. - Similarly, the edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-H???N dimer involves either achiral molecules or those of opposite chirality. No chirally pure dimers of this type are reported. Racemic compounds 42-44 that are known to pack using the C-H???N dimer were synthesized in chirally pure form. No edge-to-edge eight-membered aryl C-H???N dimers were formed in the solid state. Hence this supramolecular synthon is only favoured for achiral or racemic compounds only. - Other major conclusions are that the cause of self-resolution is due to packing energy. In some cases it is likely that solvent choice, or solvent plus temperature selection, can be used to control self-resolution.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Chirality</field><field name="subject">Molecular dynamics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21891</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Omen wallpaper</field><field name="creator">Johnson, Shannon, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This paper brings together past and contempary elements that play a role in the body of work, I prepared in the Master's project and which I call, 'Omen Wallpaper'. The title draws on the idea that 'omens' as signs and 'wallpaper', as a decoration somewhat on the periphery, surround us in the urban environment. The paper begins by describing the influences and historical movements from which I have drawn. These range, for example, from. Duchamp, Schwitters to Rauschenberg, Warhol and Basquiat. Many of these traditions share the idea of 'anti-art', particularly 'anti painting', manifested in the use of found materials, text and 'unpainterly' techniques like printing and collage. The paper then moves in to ideas more local to me and this body of work, as for example, graffiti. I explore styles of graffiti and some of the most significant artists of this movement. Artists such as 'Misstic' from Paris and 'Banksy' I also investigate some of the problematics associated with that territory, by describing the conflicts I encounter in my research. I also consider another type of' street aesthetic' that operates in a different way, exploiting the general decay and wear and tear of posters. I focus this part of my enquiry, on the French Nouveaux Realist, Jacques de la Villegle who has worked with this medium since the 1950's. Villegles work began central to my research in Paris as well as becoming a inspiration for adopting the technique of 'affiches laceries' or 'tom posters'. This technique allows one to capture a moment culturally, stylistically and randomly amoung many other things with minimal mediation which became a significant turning point in the development of my own style.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aesthetics.</field><field name="subject">Graffiti.</field><field name="subject">Street art.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of hydrogen storage and electrochemical properties of LANI5-based thin films and porous silicon thin films for mini-fuel cells and micro-batteries</field><field name="creator">Li, Chi Ying Vanessa, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two thin film materials - intermetallic and porous silicon thin films, have been studied in this thesis. The first part focuses on the hydrogen storage and electrochemical properties of single layer LaNi5-based thin films fabricated by magnetron sputtering. The aim is to enhance their performance in mini hydrogen storage systems, and their application as electrodes in thin film Ni-MH micro-batteries. Such LaNi5-based thin films were fabricated by magnetron puttering. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD), these thin films revealed a crystalline structure with uniform chemical composition. Using AFM, SEM and TEM, they were found to have a unique microstructure: (1) Nanopores of approximately 15-40 nm which could possibly act as hydrogen reservoir (2) A dense, defect free cross sectional region which would ultimately improve the efficiency and lifetime of the thin film electrodes used in thin film battery.  The hydrogen absorption/desorption behaviour of these thin films were determined by volumetric method. The maximum hydrogen content of the La-Ni-A1 film was found to be 1.45 wt% at 333 K which was very close to the theoretical  capacity of 1.47 wt%; and higher than that of the La-Ni-AI powder materials (1.2 wt%). Electrochemical properties of the films were measured by simulated battery tests. When discharged at low current, the discharge capacity of the film was similar to that of powder materials - about 220 mAh/g for the first 30 cycles. When the thin film electrode was discharged at a high rate, 4C (current density of 100 mA/g), it could reach the maximum specific capacity of 200 mAh/g and maintained this capacity for 200 cycles; the value was not attainable for La-Ni-AI powder electrode. The presence of crack propagation in film during charge/discharge cycles would improve the electrochemical performance which was different to that of powder materials. Cyclic voltammetry reported that the efficiency of the film could maintain at 80% for the first 200 cycles and gradually decreased due to the formation of corrosion products on surface, which is consistent with the galvanostatic results. XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) revealed that the corrosion products ??? A1203, La203 and La(OH)3 formed on the film surface after cyclic voltammetry.  The second part reported the hydrogen absorption/desorption behaviour of porous silicon thin films. The hydrogen content was determined quantitatively by both volumetric method and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and found to be 15 wt% at 423 K under 15 atm of hydrogen pressure. This is an extraordinary amount of hydrogen absorption which supersedes the US Department of Energy's 2007 target of 6.5 wt%. Hydrogen depth profiles of the film after hydrogenation performed by Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy confirmed there was hydrogen within the film structure, this was an indication that hydrogen was not just physisorbed on the film surface, but chemisorbed into the porous Si lattice. X-ray diffraction found that there was a lattice contraction upon hydrogen insertion, again suggesting the hydrogen entered into the film structure by chemisorption.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electrodes.</field><field name="subject">Silicon thin films.</field><field name="subject">Voltammetry.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43303</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Doubledeath--the very presence of the absent</field><field name="creator">Scheffknecht, Sandra, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The notion of doubledeath, as an idea to generate work, can be seen as both an ironic reflection on the medium of photography and a critical attempt to comment on contemporary culture. In short, the inherent characteristics of the photographic medium and its function within society are combined.  Photography embodies both death and the beginning of something autonomous and new in the very moment of the picture-taking process. A photograph is a mere simulation of what was once there, in front of the lens, transformed onto photographic paper. It then opens up a whole range of new possibilities to the viewer.  The photograph's almost life-like appearance informs the photographic myth that is the idea that a photograph provides evidence of absolute truth. This characteristic together with the possibility of manipulating and altering a photograph has been continuously exploited by mass media to influence, make and guide our perceptions towards reality. These characteristics of image-making have left the borders between fiction and fact blurred. Living in a world of over-mediation it is hard to escape and find one's way around in this melting pot of the various realities suggested. Reality today is informed by the present trace of an absent original. When this is recorded photographically, it could be described as a doubledeath.  Both this research documentation and the studio work are social comments on contemporary life and artmaking. Where photographs record scenes from life informed by visual simulation (the presence of the absent) the notion of doubledeath becomes most obvious. Moreover, they reflect contemporary culture, addressing and investigating concerns fueled by today's omnipresent commodity and life-style culture, and provoking thoughts about illusion and the crises of the real. In the 21st century we interact with, acknowledge, accept or even prefer the surface over the essence of things, and real experience becomes more diluted.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photography, Artistic -- Themes, motives.</field><field name="subject">Staged photography.</field><field name="subject">Photography, Artistic -- Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Photographic criticism.</field><field name="subject">Representation (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Image (Philosophy)</field><field name="subject">Photography -- Social aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Molecular genetic analysis of a New South Wales muscular dystrophy cohort</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Peter John, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked lethal condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is currently no cure for this disease. Several gene-based therapeutic approaches for treating DMD are currently under development but all are dependent on the knowledge of the causative dystrophin gene mutation.  A combined mutation detection approach consisting of a quantitative PCR based analysis and DNA sequencing of the dystrophin gene resulted in a mutation etection rate of 96% in the New South Wales (NSW) DMD cohort. The proportion of exon duplication mutations was twice that generally reported for similar patient opulations.  The clinical utility of the combined mutation protocol for DMD carrier testing clarified the carrier status of an additional one-third (33%) of female relatives compared to a conventional approach of biochemical, pedigree and linkage studies.  The generally accepted view that two-thirds of mothers of isolated cases of DMD are themselves mutation carriers is challenged. Although this assumption is valid for duplication and DNA sequence mutations, it is not valid for deletion mutations in the NSW cohort.  The incidence of new cases of DMD in the New South Wales population was educed from approximately 1 in 3594 live male births to 1 in 6022 live male births over a 25 year period, indicative of a significant effect of the combination of genetic counselling and improved methods of carrier detection over that period.  In a study of a cohort of boys with DMD, who had both psychological and mutational analysis, it was shown that mutations affecting the shorter, C-terminal isoforms of dystrophin are associated with decreased mean intellectual function. A hypothesis is presented that mutations within the long 5' untranslated region of the Dp140 isoform are unlikely to significantly affect expression of this brain-expressed isoform.  During the course of studying the NSW DMD cohort a family was identified which exhibited X-linkage and a unique clinical presentation involving episodes of severe and prolonged muscle weakness. A novel variant in the pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit (PDHA 1) was identified. The phenotypic effect of this variant is not proven but a body of evidence implicates this as likely to be causative of the observed phenotype.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">muscle weakness</field><field name="subject">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)</field><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Visualising the invisible :articulating the inherent features of the digital image</field><field name="creator">McQuade, Patrick John, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Contemporary digital imaging practice has largely adopted the visual characteristics of its closest mediatic relative, the analogue photograph, In this regard, new media theorist Lev Manovich observes that "Computer software does not produce such images by default. The paradox of digital visual culture is that although all imaging is becoming computer-based, the dominance of photographic and cinematic imagery is becoming even stronger. But rather than being a direct, "natural" result of photo and film technology, these images are constructed on computers" (Manovich 2001: 179), Manovich articulates the disjuncture between the technical processes involved in the digital image creation process and the visual characteristics of the final digital image with its replication of the visual qualities of the analogue photograph.  This research addresses this notion further by exploring the following. What are the defining technical features of these computer-based imaging processes? Could these technical features be used as a basis in developing an alternative aesthetic for the digital image? Why is there a reticence to visually acknowledge these technical features in contemporary digital imaging practice? Are there historic mediated precedents where the inherent technical features of the medium are visually acknowledged in the production of imagery? If these defining technical features of the digital imaging process were visually acknowledged in this image creation process, what would be the outcome?  The studio practice component of the research served as a foundation for the author's artistic and aesthetic development where the intent was to investigate and highlight four technical qualities of the digital image identified through the case studies of three digital artists, and other secondary sources, These technical qualities include: the composite RGB colour system of the digital image as it appears on screen; the pixellated microstructure of the digital image; the luminosity of the digital image as it appears on a computer monitor, and the underlying numeric and (ASCII based) alphanumeric codes of the image file which enables that most defining feature of the image file, that of programmability, Based on research in the visualization of these numeric and alphanumeric codes, digital images of bacteria produced through the use of the scanning electron microscope, were chosen as image content for an experimental body of work to draw the conceptual link between these numeric and alphanumeric codes of the image file and the coded genetic sequence of an individual bacterial entity.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Images, Photographic -- Data processing.</field><field name="subject">Image processing -- Digital techniques.</field><field name="subject">Photography -- Digital techniques.</field><field name="subject">Digital art.</field><field name="subject">Computer art.</field><field name="subject">Computer graphics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43307</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What kind of relationship with nature does art provide?</field><field name="creator">Carroll, Rachel, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The relationship with nature through art has been explored as a two fold bond. The first considers a relationship with nature via art and science, where the history and contemporary application of scientific illustration in art is explored; while the second explores past and present connections with nature via art and the landscape, particularly the panoramic tradition. Historically these relationships have predominately been about dominating nature, mans dominion over the land. Science was seen as the only authority, while our relationships with the land in art, positioned the viewer at a commanding distance above and over the land, as seen in the post colonial panoramic tradition. In contrast, -The Coorong Series- explores a lived history with nature rather than the historical role of dominance. -The Coorong Series" explores a relationship of knowledge, understanding, and the experience of nature; through two parts. The first combines art and science in -The Coorong Specimen Series', to explore the facts and knowledge that science has provided about certain plants, birds and marine life from the Coorong. Inspiration has been derived from 19thC scientific illustrations and the lyrical prints of the Coorong by Australian Artist John Olsen. Part two explores the immersive experience of the iconic landscape in ???The Coorong Landscape Series" providing a relationship that seeks to understand the functionality of the location and to celebrate the unique beauty of this diverse region. Inspiration has been gained from the landscapes by l8th and 19th C artists John Constable and Claude Monet, along with landscapes by contemporary artists, John Walker and Mandy Martin.  Through aesthetic notions such as scientific illustration, panoramic landscape, immersive scale, the collection of work, an expressionistic use of paint, and labeling of each piece like a museum display. -The Coorong landscape series" provides an exploration of a region that immerses the viewer in an experience of the location. The series portrays a relationship with nature through art that educates the viewer about The Coorong region. Connections are made between the land, birds, plants, fish, and human interaction; which results in an ecological consideration of the Coorong. Ultimately it is the educational experience that art provides allowing the viewer to explore a plethora of relationships within nature, and to explore how these relationships have changed or continue to exist within this era.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Landscape painting -- Philosophy.</field><field name="subject">Natural history illustration.</field><field name="subject">Natural history illustration -- South Australia -- Coorong, The.</field><field name="subject">Landscape painting, Australian.</field><field name="subject">Philosophy of nature.</field><field name="subject">Coorong, The (S.

They provide the basic data from which terrain indices that represent or influence environmental phenomena are derived, for example slope gradient and hydrological contributing area, and also the source from which specific morphometric features are quantified and characterised, for example mountains and drainage basins. This thesis focuses on the latter, with the aim being to develop an algorithm to characterise the landscape in terms of five morphometric features (peaks, passes, pits, ridges and valleys) and to assess its validity and effectiveness for characterising landform from DEMs.  The research in this thesis is divided into two parts. First, an algorithm of morphometric characterisation of landform from OEMs is developed based on a locally fitted quadratic surface and its positional relationship with the analysis window. Five requirements are taken into account within the algorithm: (1) the ideal cases of different morphometric features are simply and clearly defined; (2) the output is spatially continuous to reflect the inherent fuzziness of landform features; (3) the output is easily combined into a multi-scale index across a range of operational scales; (4) the standard general morphometric parameters can be easily quantified due to the easy calculation of first and second order derivatives from the quadratic surface; and (5) the algorithm is applicable to the different data structures used to represent DEMs. An additional benefit of the quadratic surface is the derivation of the R?? goodness-of-fit statistic, which allows both an assessment of the reliability of the results and the complexity of the terrain.  Of the five morphometric features identified using the algorithm, valleys are perhaps the most commonly used. Therefore the second part of this thesis is a more detailed comparison between the Multi-Scale Valleyness (MSV) and three existing algorithms (D8, D&#8734; and MrVBF). D8 and D&#8734; are global flow accumulation algorithms, and perform well when characterising valley centre lines. However, they do not identify the valley areas themselves, although this is to be expected given their formulation. MrVBF focuses on characterising valley bottoms and so performs well when characterising valleys in broad and topographically flat areas. It does not identify valleys in the steeper upland parts of a catchment, although this too is something to be expected given its formulation. MSV directly characterises valley areas from a geomorphometric point of view, and performs well for both upland and lowland catchments, irrespective of their width.  Overall, the results show that the single- and multi-scale terrain indices developed in this research perform well when characterising the five morphometric features. The approach has considerable potential for use in environmental modelling and terrain analysis.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Multi-Scale Valleyness (MSV)</field><field name="subject">Digital elevation Models (DEMs)</field><field name="subject">Morphometric features.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43326</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Three essays on econometric evaluation of public health interventions</field><field name="creator">Johar, Meliyanni, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation consists of three independent essays evaluating the impact of public health interventions in two countries, Indonesia and Australia. The first two essays concern the national pro-poor health card program in Indonesia, which fully subsidises health care purchases by its recipients. In quantifying the impact of the program, the combination of propensity score matching and difference-in-differences techniques is used to address bias due to non-random assignment. Covariates to match include both variables affecting demand and eligibility and variables measuring local health care supply. Using data from the single, nationally-representative longitudinal study of Indonesian households, the program is found to have limited impact. The second essay evaluates the program??s impact on supply variables. In the absence of a wage revision or additional staff, the program lowers the incentives for health workers to maintain their public position. This is particularly true for those workers providing outpatient care as patients can not be controlled by waiting lists. The analysis finds some evidence of reduced number of full-time doctors in areas where the distribution of health cards were most extensive. The final essay uses Australian data to investigate changes in women??s preferences for cervical screening following a screening promotion campaign and a vaccination program. Discrete choice experiments were used to elicit preferences, and results from experiments conducted prior and after the interventions were compared. Several additional comparison groups were created based on spatial variations and by variation induced by randomisation. The study finds that the interventions have minor impact on how women valued various screening attributes. However, there was a general reduction in the willingness to screen, which was unexpected given the awareness campaign. Through simulation, it is shown that an effective way to increase the screening rate is through encouraging a more active role of the provider.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Program evaluation</field><field name="subject">Health economics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43400</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The creation and repair of osteochondral defects and the effect on the opposing surfaces</field><field name="creator">Vizesi, Frank, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The repair of articular cartilage defects is a topic that has received significant focus from both basic science and clinical perspectives. The current gold standard treatment for significantly damaged or degenerated articular cartilage in the knee is a total joint replacement, although there are several drawbacks including reduced range of motion and increased instability. Whilst the total knee replacement will continue to be a valuable treatment, there is a need to find alternatives and part of the solution is having an appropriate animal model to effectively evaluate said alternative treatments.  The first part of this dissertation describes the characterization of an ovine osteochondral defect model which ultimately could be used to validate the efficacy of a variety of osteochondral implants. The effect of this femoral defect on the tibial surface, including the meniscus, was also studied and a metallic resurfacing device (HemiCAP) evaluated for its efficacy in protecting the knee from further degenerative changes. Additionally, pressure footprint and contact stresses were measured with flexible pressure sensors at flexion angles and loads determined from the sheep gait cycle. This study found that the HemiCAP device increased peak pressure when compared to all other conditions tested, especially at a point corresponding to heel strike. Since loading is known to modulate bone remodelling, micro computed tomography was used to measure changes in the subchondral and cancellous bone on the tibia opposing the surgical site. Biologically, there were no significant differences detected in the knees treated with the HemiCAP device when compared with those that had untreated osteochondral defects, which suggests that the HemiCAP device is not effective in protecting against tibial degeneration, but at least it does no more harm than not treating the defect in the first place.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An examination of the formation of consumer CSR association: the effectiveness of CSR initiatives</field><field name="creator">Gu, Haodong, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Corporate Social Responsibility is becoming a central agenda item for companies as well as capturing the burgeoning interest of academic researchers. Taking a broad overview of the recent working in this area, only embryonic research has been dedicated thus far to the consumer cognition process towards the CSR information. Motivated by this, we construct a cognitive model to investigate why some CSR initiatives are highly valued by consumers while others go unacknowledged. We test the model under experimental conditions using university students in China and Australia. The results suggest that different types of CSR initiatives, in terms of commitment, timing and fit, stimulate different levels of consumer CSR association by affecting their information cognition process, which is motivation attribution and consequence expectation. The mediating effect of consumer attribution and awareness of consequence is supported in both the hypothetical brand context and real brand context, with some slight difference in cognitive structure possibly due to the unequal familiarity and size of the companies used in the scenarios. In addition, the effect of consumer moral identity on the model is also examined to address the growing concern in the literature that moral judgment should reflect the heterogeneity of moral personalities. The results indicate that moral identity has a # direct impact on consumer attribution and awareness of consequence. However, the interaction between respondents' moral identity and the properties of initiatives, as hypothesized in the thesis, is not supported by the data. This paper launches a new perspective of explanation for the under-performance of some CSR initiatives, offering managerial implications on how companies can structure their next wave of social-oriented initiatives (or initiative portfolios).</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43414</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A comparative study of the occupational health and safety outcomes of permanent and temporary hotel workers in Ireland and Australia</field><field name="creator">McNamara, Maria, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">A substantial body of literature links precarious employment with increased exposure to occupational hazards and adverse OHS outcomes. While a majority of these studies has found that precarious work has adverse effects on OHS outcomes, findings are more mixed with regard to temporary employment (the focus of this study), and there are still many gaps in the research that have yet to be addressed. Various models have been proposed in an attempt to explain the causal mechanisms behind the health effects of precarious employment. However, relatively few studies have empirically investigated these mechanisms. There is also a dearth of research on the effects of precarious work on OHS outcomes in parts of the service sector, such as hospitality, despite the fact that these industries make extensive use of precarious work arrangements. Further, few studies have been based on international comparative data (and even fewer where the focus has been on a particular industry).  This thesis seeks to address these gaps by investigating OHS outcomes of hotel workers engaged under different employment arrangements in Ireland and Australia. There are two principle objectives to the study. The first is to examine OHS outcomes, while the second is to test and refine the Quinlan, Mayhew and Bohle (2001) Three Factor Model in an attempt to explain the links between health and precarious employment. It also aims to enhance the understanding of the mechanisms by which these factors interact to influence outcomes. This study defines and tests a health and injury structural model. The structural equation modelling techniques employed have not been used in previous studies in this area and provide a clearer portrayal of the complex relationships between the many variables affecting the OHS of precarious employees in the hotel industry. The OHS outcomes range from exposure to occupational violence and stress to a wide variety of debilitating physical ailments. This research also highlights several indirect or spillover effects of precarious employment. The inconsistencies between both locations are mainly regarding perceived job security, economic and reward pressures and lack of control over working hours. Despite these differences, there are basic similarities between the locations that are important.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Quinlan Mayhew and Bohle (2001) Three Factor Model.</field><field name="subject">Precarious employment.</field><field name="subject">OHS outcomes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of Perlecan in human cartilage development</field><field name="creator">Chuang, Christine Yu-Nung, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Cartilage development relies on the coordinated presentation of biological signals to direct chondrocyte morphology and function. This is largely controlled by perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG).  Understanding the role of perlecan and its pendant glycosaminoglycan chains (GAG) in cartilage development is essential for advances in tissue engineered cartilage replacement strategies.  Perlecan was immunolocalised to the pericellular matrix of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes in human fetal feet. Human fetal chondrocytes were isolated and cultured in 3-dimensional (3D) scaffolds for a period of 4 weeks.  Their chondrogenic phenotype, based on extracellular matrix (ECM) components, was assessed and compared to 2D cultures. Chondrocyte perlecan was immunopurified from human fetal chondrocytes grown in vitro and fetal cartilage tissue and characterised using a combination of antibody-based techniques (ELISA, Western blotting) and gel electrophoresis.  The biological function of chondrocyte perlecan was determined by its ability to form ternary complexes with fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and their receptors (FGFR) using an antibody-based technique as well as a cell proliferation assay using cells expressing FGFR isotypes.  Perelcan was restricted to the prehypertrophic and hypertrophic zones of cartilage. This zonal organisation of chondrocytes and chondrogenic properties, determined by their morphology and PG deposition, was recapitulated in the 3D constructs while 2D cultures displayed dedifferentiated chondrocytes.  Exogenous FGF2 promoted chondrocyte proliferation, while FGF18 stimulated the synthesis of perlecan, reflecting chondrocyte hypertrophy.  Chondrocyte perlecan (630kDa) contained HS, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS) chains.  Chondrocyte perlecan formed HS dependent ternary complexes with FGF2-FGFR1c and FGF18-FGFR3c, while FGF18-FGFR3c binding to perlecan protein core was also observed.  Binding of FGF18-FGFR3c to chondrocyte perlecan HS was more promiscuous than FGF2-FGFR1c.  Furthermore, chondrocyte perlecan HS mediated biological activity with FGF18 via FGFR3c, which was modulated by mammalian heparanase, while no biological activity was elicited by FGF2-FGFR1c.  The findings underline how perlecan and its GAGs interact with FGF and FGFR in a spatio-temporal manner to promote signalling, effecting chondrocyte behaviour and morphology in cartilage development.  This insight can be utilised in tissue engineering to improve the development of biologically functional cartilage replacements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cartilage</field><field name="subject">Perlecan</field><field name="subject">Heparan sulfate</field><field name="subject">Fibroblast growth factors</field><field name="subject">Chondrocytes</field><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44417</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of dissenting opinions upon the development of Australian constitutional law</field><field name="creator">Lynch, Andrew, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to assess the role played by disagreement in the High Court???s constitutional law decisions. It does so firstly by considering the theoretical arguments in favour of allowing expression of dissent and those which urge judicial restraint and observance of precedential values. The tensions between change and conformity, and also the individual and institutional aspects of adjudication, intersect when the Court divides. The complex nature of disagreement on a multimember judicial body is further examined in the context of devising an empirical methodology for the quantification of dissent on the High Court. The thesis selects a period of a little over twenty years for detailed examination. Within that timeframe, it measures the prevalence and nature of disagreement amongst the Justices of the Court, with particular emphasis upon constitutional cases. From these results, various streams of opinion are examined for subsequent significance. In particular, the thesis contrasts the practice of persistent dissent from the Court???s approach to an issue, with those occasions when a minority Justice yields to the demands of stare decisis. The impact of dissent upon the development of the Court???s constitutional interpretation is evaluated. Although the study finds that direct reversals in the law in favour of an earlier dissent occur very rarely, it argues that dissents may still exercise a powerful influence on the Court???s pronouncements. The contribution which minority opinions make to judicial deliberation is to inevitably alter the context of the Court???s decision. Consideration of two specific case studies illustrates that this may result in the law taking a more moderate path or may actually lead to greater efforts by a majority to strengthen the cogency of its approach. In either scenario, dissent plays a far more subtle role than suggested by the myth of a ???Great Dissenter??? and the dramatic redemption of his or her lone opinions. To only assess the value of dissenting judgments against that standard is to fail to appreciate the true nature of their influence in many cases and their importance to the work of the High Court.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">High Court</field><field name="subject">Dissenting opinions</field><field name="subject">Constitutional law</field><field name="subject">Cases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21996</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The analysis of signalling pathways in sporadic colorectal carcinoma using tissue microarrays</field><field name="creator">Mckenzie, Gavin, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Colorectal carcinoma arises through sequential genetic changes whereby an adenoma develops from normal colonic epithelium and then becomes a carcinoma. Critical to this process is two forms of mutually exclusive genomic instability ?? chromosomal instability (CIN) and microsatellite instability (MSI). The colorectal tumours that develop from each of these pathways have distinct pathological and molecular differences. Most MSI+ colorectal carcinomas are associated with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) - an epigenetic phenomenon where a specific and consistent group of genes are silenced through promoter methylation. However, over half of fall CIMP+ colorectal tumours are microsatellite stable (MSS).  It is well known that the WNT/&#946;-catenin signalling pathway is instrumental in the initiation and development of CIN type tumours but it is less clear whether this pathway has any significant involvement in MSI+ or methylated tumours. The role of the PI3K1AKT signalling pathway in the development of solid human tumours has only recently been established and the affects of abnormal PI3K/AKT signalling in sporadic colorectal carcinomas is yet to be fully elucidated. The objective of this thesis was to investigate the involvement of the WNT/&#946;-catenin and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways in the CIN, MSI+ and methylated subgroups of sporadic colorectal carcinoma.  To achieve this, the expression patterns of &#946;-catenin, p-AKT and PTEN were identified by immunohistochemistry on sections from tissue microarrays consisting of cores from a large group of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. Each of these proteins is an integral part of the constitutive activation of WNT/&#946;-catenin or PI3K/AKT signalling and their expression patterns were correlated with the clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics of the different subgroups of colorectal carcinoma.  Increased nuclear &#946;-catenin expression, an indicator of activated WNT signalling, is associated with MSS and the pathological features of CIN type tumours and inversely associated with the pathological and molecular features of MSI+ and CIMP+ tumours. In all forms of sporadic colorectal carcinoma, nuclear &#946;-catenin expression was not an indicator of overall survival.  PTEN was not associated with any particular subgroup of sporadic colorectal carcinoma, but decreased cytoplasmic expression was indicative of overall worse outcome, especially in MSS or CIN type tumours.  While the identification of nuclear &#946;-catenin in sporadic colorectal carcinomas is not a satisfactory prognostic marker, the immunohistochemical detection of absent PTEN expression may prove useful in identifying poor outcome in individuals with sporadic MSS colorectal carcinoma.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Colorectal carcinoma.</field><field name="subject">Tissue microarray.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43370</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance and firm outcomes: causation or spurious correlation?</field><field name="creator">Tan, David Tatwei, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">The rapid growth of financial markets and the increasing diffusion of corporate ownership have placed tremendous emphasis on the effectiveness of corporate governance in resolving agency conflicts within the firm. This study investigates the corporate governance and firm performance/failure relation by implementing various econometric modelling methods to disaggregate causal relations and spurious correlations. Using a panel dataset of Australian firms, a comprehensive suite of corporate governance mechanisms are considered; including the ownership, remuneration, and board structures of the firm. Initial ordinary least squares (OLS) and fixed-effects panel specifications report significant causal relations between various corporate governance measures and firm outcomes. However, the dynamic generalised method of moments (GMM) results indicate that no causal relations exist when taking into account the effects of simultaneity, dynamic endogeneity, and unobservable heterogeneity. Moreover, these results remain robust when accounting for the firm??s propensity for fraud. The findings support the equilibrium theory of corporate governance and the firm, suggesting that a firm??s corporate governance structure is an endogenous characteristic determined by other firm factors; and that any observed relations between governance and firm outcomes are spurious in nature. Chapter 2 examines the corporate governance and firm performance relation. Using a comprehensive suite of corporate governance measures, this chapter finds no evidence of a causal relation between corporate governance and firm performance when accounting for the biases introduced by simultaneity, dynamic endogeneity, and unobservable heterogeneity. This result is consistent across all firm performance measures.  Chapter 3 explores the corporate governance and likelihood of firm failure relation by implementing the Merton (1974) model of firm-valuation. Similarly, no significant causal relations between a firm??s corporate governance structure and its likelihood of failure are detected when accounting for the influence of endogeneity on the parameter estimates. Chapter 4 re-examines the corporate governance and firm performance/failure relation within the context of corporate fraud. Using KPMG and ASIC fraud databases, the corporate governance and firm outcome relations are estimated whilst accounting for the firms?? vulnerability to corporate fraud.

The molecular mechanisms regulating PDGF-D transcription are unknown. Here I investigated the effects of angiotensin II (ATIl) and IL-1 beta on the transcription of PDGF-D and changes in vascular SMCs phenotype.  Primer extension analysis mapped a single transcriptional start site to the ccAG CGC motif of PDGF-D promoter. Several potential transcription factor binding sites such as SpI, Ets-1, NF-??B, IRF-1, p53, Smad4 and AP1 were located in the proximal 1168bp of the PDGF-D promoter. ATII-inducible Ets-1 and PDGF-D gene expression is mediated via H202. IL-I beta supresses PDGF-D promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression in SMCs through NF-??B p65, IRF-1 and HDAC1, which form complex in the PDGF-D promoter. This study provides the first direct link between NF-KB and the PDGF-D promoter, IRF-1 with any member of the PDGF family and a new example of HDAC mediated inhibition of gene expression.  In summary, this study investigates for the first time the mechanisms mediating the transcriptional regulation of PDGF-D in vascular SMCs. This provides valuable insights into the molecular control of vascular phenotype, and opens up potential opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Vascular smooth muscles cells (SMCs)</field><field name="subject">Mitogens.</field><field name="subject">Chemo-attractants.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43372</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The roles of oxygen and disulfide reductases in the physiology of Campylobacterales</field><field name="creator">Kaakoush, Nadeem O., Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work has studied several aspects of the physiology of the animal-colonizing species Campylobacterjejuni, Helicobacter pylori. Wolinella succinogenes and Arcobacter butzleri. C. jejuni and H pylori were found to be obligate microaerophiles and W.succinogenes an anaerobe. A. butzleri was found to be an aerobe able to grow anaerobically. Comparative analyses of the responses of C. jejuni, H pylori and W. succinogenes to various oxygen concentrations were investigated using transcriptomics and genes differentially expressed at higher oxygen concentrations were identified. At the time of this study no microarrays were available for A. butzleri. These comparative studies provided a better understanding of bacterial adaptation to and interaction with their environment. Several enzymes involved in oxireduction processes, including disulfide reductases, were upregulated under oxidative stress.  Disulfide reductases of host-colonizing bacteria are involved in the expression of virulence factors, resistance to drugs, and elimination of toxic compounds. CXXC and CXXC-derived motifs are present in the active sites of disulfide reductases and are essential for the catalysis of these redox reactions. Large-scale genome analyses of 281 prokaryotes identified CXXC and CXXC-derived motifs in each microorganism. The total number of these motifs showed correlations with genome size and oxygen tolerance of the prokaryotes. Specific bioinformatic analyses served to identify putative disulfide reductases in the four Campylobacterales species.  The project investigated the involvement of these enzymes in resistance to the antibiotic metronidazole, cadmium detoxication and pathogenesis. The activities of disulfide reductases were modulated by the presence of metronidazole, and its reduction was inhibited by the presence of disulfide reductase substrates. In addition, proteins involved in oxireduction of the low redox potential ferredoxin were downregulated in metronidazole resistant strains, suggesting that ferredoxin is involved in the resistant phenotype. Cellular processes and pathways regulated under cadmium stress included fatty acid biosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, chemotaxis and mobility, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, protein modification, redox processes and heat shock response. Notably, the data provided evidence for a role of oxireduction processes in the development of metronidazole resistance and the detoxication of cadmium.  Furthermore, a method was developed to identify thiol disulfide oxidoreductases in the four Campylobacterales. The results suggested that H pylori contained a novel disulfide bond formation system. Investigation of their potential involvement in virulence or colonization indicated that the putative thiol disulfide oxidoreductases HP0231 and HP0595 are related to the colonization efficiency ofH pylori.  Finally, the only known disulfide reduction system in Campylobacterales, the thioredoxin system, was investigated in more detail. Phylogenetic analyses of the thioredoxin reductases TrxB1 and TrxB2 of the four bacteria were performed. The phylogenetic features of the TrxB2 suggested a special role for this enzyme in the physiology of these bacteria; thus, the enzyme was investigated further in H pylori. TrxB2 was found to be an NADPH reductase, possibly involved in important oxireduction processes within the cell.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disulfide reductases.</field><field name="subject">Microaerophiles.</field><field name="subject">Anaerobe.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The organizational diffusion of service-oriented computing</field><field name="creator">Luthria, Haresh, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Corporations are actively pursuing business model innovation and organizational agility in the quest for sustainable competitive advantage in today??s global marketplace. The paradigm of service-oriented computing (SOC) has emerged as a popular approach to flexibility and agility, not just in systems development but also in business process management. The associated concept of service-oriented architecture (SOA) enables the defining of business flows as technology independent services, potentially providing avenues for agility in business process transformation. This architectural concept is growing in popularity and is being rapidly adopted by industry organizations. Studies of the practical impacts of adopting SOA are crucial because it involves a non-trivial and expensive overhaul of both business and technology infrastructures. There is, however, a paucity of critical research on the adoption of SOA. What is needed is a focus on the study of the real-world adoption of SOA across the enterprise and the factors that aid or impede such adoptions. This research examines the organizational use of SOA, both analytically and empirically through case studies, and posits a diffusion framework for the adoption and implementation of SOA as an enterprise strategy. The SOA Diffusion Framework addresses the following key areas ?? the organizational factors influencing the decision to adopt SOA, the organizational aspects of adopting and implementing SOA, and the outcomes or realized benefits of implementing SOA across the enterprise.  For researchers, this study (i) fills a crucial knowledge gap because there is little empirical evidence of the practical use of SOA, (ii) adds to the innovation diffusion literature, (iii) introduces a tool to assess the organizational impact of SOA, and (iv) provides direction for future research into the organizational factors relating to the enterprise adoption of service-orientation. For practitioners, this study provides an adoption framework and a set of guidelines to help implement SOA successfully across the enterprise.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organizational Impact</field><field name="subject">Service-Oriented</field><field name="subject">Diffusion</field><field name="subject">SOA</field><field name="subject">SOC</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation of two-phase flow properties of small core samples</field><field name="creator">Olafuyi, Olalekan Adisa, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an experimental investigation of two-phase flow properties of porous rock samples having different scales ranging from micro-CT imaging to conventional core plug scales. Advances in micro-CT imaging of porous materials provide the opportunity to extract representative networks from the images. This improves the predictive capability of porescale network models to predict multiphase flow properties. However, all these predictions need to be validated with laboratory data. Micro-CT imaging is currently limited to small sample sizes, having bulk volumes of the order of 0.1 cm??. Conventional core plugs, however, have sizes several orders of magnitude larger than that (bulk volumes of 10 cm?? or larger). The aim of this thesis is to investigate the scale effect on laboratory data and to provide reliable experimental data which can be used to test the predictive value of microCT based network models.  Berea and Bentheim sandstones and Mount Gambier carbonate were used in the experiments. The core samples were thoroughly cleaned in order to obtain strongly, uniform water-wet conditions. Simple well-characterized fluid systems were chosen in the experiments: Air-brine fluid-system for drainage capillary pressure, resistivity index and spontaneous imbibition experiments while oil-brine fluid-system for wettability and relative permeability measurements.  Drainage capillary pressure, resistivity index, relative permeability and spontaneous imbibition measurements were made on the cores having bulk volumes ranging from 0.1 to 12 cm??. Previous studies have shown that experiments at this scale are still lacking. The wettability was tried to keep strongly water-wet for all experiments.  The experimental results show that the measurements of drainage capillary pressure, and resistivity index and spontaneous imbibition on small core samples, having similar scales as micro-CT imaging can be made accurately in the laboratory. The measurement of relative permeability remains challenging.  This thesis concludes that commonly used homogeneous rock types (Berea and Bentheim sandstones and Mt. Gambier carbonate) can be considered to be sufficiently homogeneous from the pore to core scale based on the two-phase flow properties examined in this study. Hence, laboratory data taken from these rocks using conventional core plugs can be used to calibrate micro-CT based network models for multiphase flow properties.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Berea and Bentheim sandstones.</field><field name="subject">Porous rock.</field><field name="subject">Micro-CT imaging.</field><field name="subject">Mt Gambier carbonate.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Enrichment techniques for enhanced detection of campylobacter in broiler chicken carcasses</field><field name="creator">Thee, Jelvia Amianco, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Campylobacter has been known for more than a century and today Campylobacter infection is considered the leading cause of bacterial foodborne disease in the developed world. Consumption of undercooked poultry and/ or handling of raw poultry are seen as the main transmissions of Campylobacterto humans due to high levels (107 and 108 CFUlg) of C.jejunifound in the intestinal tract of raw poultry.  Several studies have suggested that by delaying addition of antibiotics for 2 h at 37??C there was a better recovery of Campylobacter in food samples. Rinses from sixty whole carcasses were treated to non-pre-enrichment incubation and preenrichment at 37??C or 42??C for 2, 4 and 6h. Using TECRA?????? CAMVIA immunoassay method, results showed that 100% of the carcasses were positive for Campylobacter when the pre-enrichment techniques was applied compared to just 30-60% positive results from non pre-enrichment techniques.  To develop more efficient enrichment methods, thirty carcass rinses were incubated in Bolton, Preston and TECRA??? broth under aerobic and microaerobic atmosphere at 25??C and 42??C. Results' from TECRA??? CAMVIA revealed that recovery of Campylobacter spp. from TECRA??? broth under aerobic conditions and Bolton or Preston broth under microaerobic conditions are not significantly different (p &gt; 0.05). Charcoal based CCDA and Karmali agar were as effective as blood based Campy-Cefex agar in isolating Campylobacter spp. although Karmali was better in suppressing the growth of background microflora.  Twenty samples of retail poultry carcasses, offal, portion chicken, mince respectively and ten samples of each fresh chicken sausages and frozen nuggets respectively were enriched in TECRA??? and Preston broths for recovery of Campylobacter. TECRA???

This study offers a close analysis of the life and work of Canberra architect Enrico Taglietti, who migrated to Australia from Italy in 1955.  His work demonstrates a 'highly personal style' offering more depth and playfulness of form and content than the work of his contemporaries. Taglietti designed a broad range of private and public buildings in Canberra, his adopted 'invisible city', including Dickson District Library, Giralang Primary School and the War Memorial Repository, and received in 2007 the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) Gold Medal. Yet, despite this success his work has received limited acknowledgment from Australian architectural historians. who show a persistent difficulty with integrating Taglietti's architectural language into prevailing architectural schema. This study adopts an integrated methodology offered by Manfredo Tafuri's 'operative criticism', micro-history and oral history to retrace the origin of Taglietti's 'idiosyncratic design', arguing that an understanding of Taglietti's formative experiences, his habitus (in the words of Pierre Bourdieu), can shed light on his architectural language. Taglietti inherited Bruno Zevi's, Carlo De Carli's and Frank L10yd Wright's belief in the architectural continuum space as the fundamental expression of the modernist period, Pier Luigi Nervi's notion of arte del costruire as the combination of technical as well as artistic knowledge, and the sense of craft as learnt from contact with the Finnish designer Tapio Wirkkala at the 1954 Milan Triennale. With an extraordinary attachment to Canberra, Taglietti developed an architectural language which responds to place, with its strong formalist extemal volumes juxtaposed to an idiosyncratic complex internal spatial arrangement. In questioning whether Taglietti shared common intellectual ground with Australian architects, and whether this common ground was Zevi's and Wright's view of architecture and urban design. this study argues that lan McKay (b.1932) is the Australian architect who shares common aspects with Taglietti, including ideas on the role of the architect as an urbanist.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australian architecture.</field><field name="subject">European migrant architects.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43421</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hierarchical reinforcement learning in adversarial environments</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Hing-Wah, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is known that one of the downfalls of reinforcement learning is the amount of time required to learn an optimal policy. This especially holds true for environments with large state spaces or environments with multiple agents. It is also known that standard Q-Learning develops a deterministic policy, and so in games where a stochastic policy is required (such as rock, paper, scissors) a Q-Learner opponent can be defeated without too much difficulty once the learning has ceased.  Initially we investigated the impact that the MAXQ hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm had in an adversarial environment. We found that it was difficult to conduct state space abstraction, especially when an unpredictable or co-evolving opponent was involved. We noticed that to keep the domains zero-sum, discounted learning was required. We had also found that a speed increase could be obtained through the use of hierarchy in the adversarial environment.  We then investigated the ability to obtain similar learning speed increases to adversarial reinforcement learning through the use of this hierarchical methodology. Applying the hierarchical decomposition to Bowling's Win or Learn Fast (WoLF) algorithm we were able to maintain the accelerated learning rate whilst simultaneously retaining the stochastic elements of the WoLF algorithm. We made an assessment on the impact of the adversarial component of the hierarchy at both the higher and lower tiers of the hierarchical tree.  Finally, we introduce the idea of pivot points. A pivot point is the last possible time you can wait before having to make a decision and thus revealing your strategy to the opponent. This results in maximising confusion for the opponent. Through the use of these pivot points, which could only have been discovered through the use of hierarchy, we were able to perform improved state-space abstraction since no decision needed to be made, in regards to the opponent, until this point was reached.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bowling's Win or Learn Fast (WoLF) algorithm.</field><field name="subject">Q-Learning.</field><field name="subject">Reinforcement learning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43424</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tracers and indicators of estuarine nutrients</field><field name="creator">Moore, Stephanie Kay, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Three novel methods were examined to assess the effects of nutrient enrichment in three sub-tropical east Australian estuaries with differing levels of catchment disturbance. The Manning and Wallamba River catchments are 8927 and 500 km2 respectively and support intensive livestock agriculture and some residential development, whereas the smaller Wallingat River catchment is 185 km2 and is mostly forested. The Wallamba and Wallingat Rivers flow into Wallis Lake, which was the site of an environmental crisis in 1997 when the consumption of sewage-contaminated locally grown oysters caused an outbreak of Hepatitis A. This study contributes valuable and extensive water quality data to assess rehabilitative works in Wallis Lake, and in other estuaries, to reduce the input of nutrients such as sewage. The importance of various sources, loads and sinks and the dispersion and assimilation of nutrients were quantified and compared for each estuary. An ecological model coupled with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic box model revealed that nearly all of the nitrogen inputs to the modified Wallamba River entered as runoff from the intensively livestock farmed upper catchment. In contrast, in the forested Wallingat River nitrogen was generated internally from anoxic sediments and was also longitudinally dispersed upstream from the junction with the modified Coolongolook River. Bloom conditions of up to 59 mg m-3 were observed in the Wallamba River between 7 and 11 days after the storms, but in spite of high concentrations of biologically available nitrogen in the forested Wallingat River, phytoplankton biomass was low due to phosphate limitation. Longitudinal dispersion could not counter phytoplankton growth in the modified Wallamba River, in spite of large increases in river flow. Estimates of grazing pressure by the pygmy mussel, Xenostrobus securis, demonstrate that it could contribute up to half of the phytoplankton loss. The inter-tidal mangrove pneumatophore habitat of X. securis allows filtering of the upper water column from the lateral boundaries in a vertically stratified water column, exerting top-down control on phytoplankton biomass.  The optical plankton counter (OPC) can provide an in situ, rapid assessment of zooplankton productivity over large temporal and spatial scales from the size distribution of zooplankton. High concentrations of sub-resolved particles, including suspended detritus, have hampered the use of the in situ OPC in estuaries. Up to 58 counts L-1 due to the coincidence of sub-resolved particles passing through 100 ??m mesh were detected by the laboratory OPC in Manning, Wallamba and Wallingat River water samples. The influence of these erroneous counts on in situ OPC measurements was assessed by comparison with measurements of simultaneously collected net zooplankton measured using the laboratory OPC. In situ OPC measurements of total zooplankton abundance could be corrected for erroneous counts of sub-resolved particles using laboratory OPC measurements of 100 ??m mesh filtered water samples from the same site, but estimates had large associated error and information on the size structure of the zooplankton community is sacrificed. In contrast to expected relationships, no meaningful or significant correlations were found between the number or biomass of sub-resolved particles and in situ light attenuance. Laboratory OPC measurements of net zooplankton in each estuary revealed that the modified Manning and Wallamba Rivers supported a greater biomass of zooplankton compared to the forested Wallingat River. The normalised biomass size spectra of net zooplankton responded to both production of small particles and predation and loss of large particles.  The effect of catchment disturbance on the nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (??15N and ??13C) of X. securis was investigated in the three estuaries. Manning and Wallamba River mussels were enriched in ??15N by an average of 3.2??? and 1.5??? respectively compared to mussels from the forested Wallingat River. The isotope values of particulate organic matter showed a similar pattern to mussels, indicating a direct link between them within each estuary. A multiple regression model of mussel ??15N using the fractions of land used for livestock agriculture and residential development within 5 km zones from river networks to a distance equivalent to a tidal ellipse from sites explained 67% of the variation in mussel ??15N with 95% of the differences lying within 1.6??? of observed values. Increasing fractions of land used for livestock agriculture in the regression equation depleted estimated mussel ??15N indicating the use of cow manure as a nutrient source with a value of 2.0???. Increasing fractions of land used for residential development enriched estimated mussel ??15N, indicating the use of human-derived waste with a value of 20.8???.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Estuarine ecology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/21993</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A biomechanical analysis of patient handling techniques and equipment in a remote setting.</field><field name="creator">Muriti, Andrew John, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Remote area staff performing manual patient handling tasks in the absence of patient lifting hoists available in most health care settings are at an elevated risk of musculoskeletal injuries.  The objective of this project was to identify the patient handling methods that have the lowest risk of injury.  The patient handling task of lifting a patient from floor to a chair or wheelchair is a common task performed in a remote health care setting.  The task was performed utilising three methods, these being: (1) heads/tails lift, (2) use of two Blue MEDesign?? slings and (3) use of a drawsheet.  The task of the heads/tails lift was broken down into two distinctly separate subtasks: lifting from the (1) head and (2) tail ends of the patient load.  These techniques were selected based on criteria including current practice, durability, portability, accessibility, ease of storage and cost to supply.  Postural data were obtained using a Vicon 370 three - dimensional motion measurement and analysis system in the Biomechanics &amp; Gait laboratory at the University of New South Wales.  Forty reflective markers were placed on the subject to obtain the following joint angles: ankle, knee, hip, torso, shoulder, elbow, and wrist.  The raw data were converted into the respective joint angles (Y, X, Z) for further analysis.  The postural data was analysed using the University of Michigan???s Three-Dimensional Static Strength Prediction Program (3D SSPP) and the relative risk of injury was based on the following three values: (1) a threshold value of 3,400 N for compression force, (2) a threshold value of 500 N for shear force, and (3) population strength capability data.  The effects on changes to the anthropometric data was estimated and analysed using the in-built anthropometric data contained within the 3D SSPP program for 6 separate lifter scenarios, these being male and female 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles.  Changes to the patient load were estimated and analysed using the same computer software.  Estimated compressive and shear forces were found to be lower with the drawsheet and tail component of the heads/tails lift in comparison to the use of the Blue MEDesign?? straps and head component of the heads/tails lift.  The results obtained for the strength capability aspect of each of the lifts indicated a higher percentage of the population capable of both the drawsheet and tail end of the heads/tails lift.  The relative risk of back injury for the lifters is distributed more evenly with the drawsheet lift as opposed to the heads/tails (tail) lift where risk is disproportionate with the heavier end being lifted. The use of lifter anthropometrics does not appear to be a realistic variable to base assumptions on which group of the population are capable of safely performing this task in a remote setting. This study advocates the use of the drawsheet lift in a remote setting based on the author???s experience and the biomechanical results obtained in this study.  The drawsheet lift is both more accessible and provides a more acceptable risk when more than two patient handlers are involved, in comparison to the other lifts utilised lifting patients from floor to a chair.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Patient Handling</field><field name="subject">Biomechanical</field><field name="subject">Nursing</field><field name="subject">Remote Health</field><field name="subject">Patients</field><field name="subject">Positioning</field><field name="subject">Rural health services</field><field name="subject">Lifting and carrying</field><field name="subject">Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Biomechanics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22002</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hospital performance including quality: creating economic incentives consistent with evidence-based medicine</field><field name="creator">Eckermann, Simon, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis addresses questions of how to incorporate quality of care, represented by disutility-bearing effects such as mortality, morbidity and re-admission, in measuring relative performance of public hospitals. Currently, case-mix funding and performance, measured with costs per case-mix adjusted separation, hold hospitals accountable for costs, but not effects, of care, creating economic incentives for quality of care minimising cost per admission.  To allow an appropriate trade-off between the value and cost of quality of care a correspondence is demonstrated between maximising net benefit and minimising costs plus decision makers??? value of disutility events, where effects of care can be represented by disutility events and hospitals face a common comparator. Applying this correspondence to performance measurement, frontier methods specifying disutility events as inputs are illustrated to have distinct advantages over output specifications, allowing estimation of: 1. economic efficiency conditional on the value of avoiding disutility events. 2. technical, scale and congestion sources of net benefit efficiency; 3. best practice peers over potential decision makers??? value of quality; and 4. industry shadow price of avoiding disutility events.  The accountability this performance measurement framework provides for effects and cost of quality of care are also illustrated as the basis for moving from case-mix funding towards a funding mechanism based on maximising net benefit. Links to evidence-based medicine in health technology assessment are emphasised in illustrating application of the correspondence to comparison of multiple strategies in the cost-disutility plane, where radial properties as shown to provide distinct advantages over comparison in the cost-effectiveness plane.  The identified performance measurement and funding framework allows policy makers to create economic incentives consistent with evidence-based medicine in practice, while avoiding incentives for cream-skimming and cost-shifting. The linear nature of the net benefit correspondence theorem allows simple inclusion of multiple effects of quality, whether expressed as not meeting a standard, functional limitation or disutility directly. In applying the net benefit correspondence theorem to hospitals a clinical activity level is suggested, to allow correspondence conditions to be robustly satisfied in identification of effects with decision analytic methods, adjustment for within DRG risk factors and data linkage to effects beyond separation.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public hospitals</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Hospital care</field><field name="subject">Quality control</field><field name="subject">Administration</field><field name="subject">Cost of operation</field><field name="subject">Quality assurance</field><field name="subject">Evidence-based medicine</field><field name="subject">Medical policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22011</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms and modelling of sonochemically-mediated free radical degradation of contaminants</field><field name="creator">Han, Hyungjin, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hazardous and recalcitrant pollutants in the environments have led to a great many environmental issues these days. Many researchers have focused on the approaches to treatment of these pollutants which contaminate environments such as soil, surface and groundwater. As an advanced oxidation processes  (AOPs), sonolysis which is the oxidation technology involving the use of ultrasonic irradiation, has proven to be successful for the treatment and remediation of contaminated environments.  In this thesis, hydrogen peroxide formation and formic acid degradation by ultrasonic irradiation of well-characterised solutions are described under various conditions in order to determinate reaction mechanism by which peroxide degradation and contaminant degradation occur. The effect of gas properties and frequency on hydrogen peroxide and formic acid degradation are examined. Experimental results obtained are analyzed in light of the reactions occurring. Successful mathematical modeling of the result s obtained confirms that, for the most part, hydrogen peroxide and formic degradation occur by free radical generation within bubbles with subsequent transfer of these radicals to the bubble-water interface where the majority of the degradation occurs. The effect of Fe(II) addition which can lead to Fenton reactions in the bulk solution are also investigated. Experimental and model results show that the heterogeneous reactions can enhance the degradation of formic acid in the presence of Fe(II).  Oxidation of phenol by ultrasonic irradiation under a variety of initial conditions and solution environments is also described and validated by a simple kinetic model. The model developed will be useful for improving our understanding of free radicals behaviour and the interplay between free radical generation and contaminant degradation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pollutants.</field><field name="subject">Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs)</field><field name="subject">Ultrasonic irradiation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43485</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation of cementite from hematite and titanomagnetite iron ore and its stability</field><field name="creator">Longbottom, Raymond James, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project examined the reduction and formation of cementite from hematite and titanomagnetite ores and cementite stability. The aim of the project was to develop further understanding of cementite stability under conditions relevant to direct ironmaking and the mechanism of cementite decomposition. The reduction of hematite and ironsand by hydrogen-methane-argon gas mixtures was investigated from 600??C to 1100??C. Iron oxides were reduced by hydrogen to metallic iron, which was carburised by methane to form cementite. The hematite ore was reduced more quickly than the ironsand. Preoxidation of the ironsand accelerated its reduction. Hematite was converted to cementite faster than preoxidised ironsand. The decomposition of cementite formed from hematite was investigated from 500??C to 900??C. This cementite was most stable at temperatures 750-770??C. The decomposition rate increased with decreasing temperature between 750??C and 600??C and with increasing temperature above 770??C.

As TC;P is a reliable protocol it is not suited for real time applications. One of the basic objectives of formulating the Datagaram Congestion Control protocol (DCCP) was to help fight the ever existing problem of network overload for real-time applications by performing intelligent congestion control at the transport protocol level, which would be fair to co-existing TCP data streams. This problem becomes more serious and relevant ,when it comes to satellite links,  where we have limited bandwidth, long delay and comparatively larger amount of transmission errors. This thesis focuses on three main things as a part of the research: first, it identifies the characteristics of DCCP over live satellite and 1011g range wireless links and evaluates their performance [l]. Secondly, it proposes modifications to DCCP's existing congestion control mechanisms so that it can perform better over satellite links [2]. And finally, the thesis extends its scope to VoIP applications and proposes further modifications to improve voice quality using DCCP over satellite links [3]. All the proposals presented in this thesis were first evaluated by simulation and then by performing experiments with a DCCP network stack of a real operating system and on a live satellite link.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43511</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Use of Higher Order Harmonics from a Limiter to Improve the Single-Tone Detection Performance of an Envelope Detector</field><field name="creator">Chowdhury, Rehana Momtaz, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The limiter is a commonly used device in communication receiving systems to remove  the amplitude variations of the received signal, but it is usually observed that limiter degrades the envelope detection performance of a single tone. In this thesis, it is demonstrated that the limiter-generated third harmonic can be used to improve the envelope detection performance of a single tone over that of the linearly processed  fundamental. Differences in the probability distributions of the limiter-generated  harmonics cause differences in their detection probabilities, which lead to differences in  the performance of subsequent envelope detection. Comparison of the envelope detection performance of the limiter-generated third harmonic and the input to the limiter shows a maximum detection probability gain of 1.12 and also error probability  gain of 2.4 in linear scale, whereas the fundamental harmonic does not show any  practically significant gain.  The envelope detection performance of the vector sum of the limiter-generated  fundamental and third harmonics is also evaluated. This combination provides better  performance than do the individual harmonics, especially for a large clipping parameter of the limiter. The combined harmonics shows a maximum detetction probability gain  of 1.15 and error probability gain of 14, over that of the envelope detection performance of a tone without limiter. It is also observed that the envelope detection performance of a tone with limiter-generated higher harmonics shows non-monotonic behaviour as  functions of either noise or the limiter-clipping parameter, which is a signature of  stochastic resonance.  The theoretical results from earlier research on the envelope detection of a single tone  embedded in additive white Gaussian noise, both with and without a limiter, are  presented and shown to match our simulation results. In previous work when a limiter  was used in the envelope detection of a single tone, only the envelope of the  fundamental harmonic was considered under very specific conditions. By contrast we also take notice of the limiter-generated higher harmonics and obtain improved  envelope detection performance in the detection of a single tone.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Harmonics (Electric waves)</field><field name="subject">Amplitude variations</field><field name="subject">Envelope detection</field><field name="subject">Vibration measurement.</field><field name="subject">Limiter circuits</field><field name="subject">Tone detection</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43512</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'The centre cannot hold': resistance, accommodation and control in three Australian call centres</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Alison Kate, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisational Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">Drawing upon case studies of three organisations operating six call centres in Australia, this thesis explores the manifestations and interplay of employee resistance and accommodation in response to five facets of employer control: electronic monitoring; repetitious work; emotional control; the built environment; and workplace flexibility.  Accommodation refers to the ways workers protect themselves from and adapt to the pressures that make up their day-to-day experiences of work. Accommodation, unlike resistance, which implies opposition to control, may superficially resemble consent to control. I argue that resistance and accommodation are not polar opposites; rather they are both reflections of the conflict and tensions that lie at the heart of the employment relationship.  At the study sites, employees utilised resistance and accommodation both separately and concurrently. An explanation of these seemingly contradictory responses and of the links among accommodation individual resistance and collective resistance lies in the concept of ???self???. In this thesis, ???self??? refers to workers??? perceptions of fairness, dignity and autonomy. I examine how these notions frame worker discontent and promote employee solidarity. ???Everyday resistance???, a concept first developed by Scott (1985) in relation to peasant struggles, is employed to highlight the existence of subterranean struggles in workplaces that otherwise appear to be harmonious. At the study sites, everyday resistance was a multi-faceted, widely employed strategy whose strength lay primarily in its immediate impact. There was, however, no necessary sequential development from accommodation, through everyday resistance to overt, formal forms of conflict. What was evident was that multiple responses to employer control could co-exist and inhibit or promote one another. But it was through organised collective resistance that more formalised gains were made and widely held grievances addressed.  I suggest that, although everyday resistance may lay the groundwork for more formal struggles, one should not conclude that traditional collective resistance is ???genuine??? resistance and everyday resistance is simply a second-best prelude to it. Although conflict is always present, its intensity differs. If we are to understand the complexity of worker responses to managerial control, we need to expand the theoretical frameworks within which we analyse and interpret conflict.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">call centres</field><field name="subject">call centers</field><field name="subject">labour process</field><field name="subject">labor process</field><field name="subject">resistance</field><field name="subject">accommodation</field><field name="subject">monitoring</field><field name="subject">repetitious work</field><field name="subject">customer service</field><field name="subject">built environment</field><field name="subject">flexibility</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">Employees</field><field name="subject">Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Case studies</field><field name="subject">Employee attitude surveys</field><field name="subject">Employee morale</field><field name="subject">Work environment</field><field name="subject">Control</field><field name="subject">Psychology</field><field name="subject">Electronic monitoring in workplace</field><field name="subject">Quality of work life</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22026</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust incremental relational learning</field><field name="creator">Westendorp, James, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Real-world learning tasks present a range of issues for learning systems. Learning tasks can be complex and the training data noisy. When operating as part of a larger system, there may be limitations on available memory and computational resources. Learners may also be required to provide results from a stream. This thesis investigates the problem of incremental, relational learning from imperfect data with constrained time and memory resources.  The learning process involves incremental update of a theory when an example is presented that contradicts the theory. Contradictions occur if there is an incorrect theory or noisy data. The learner cannot discriminate between the two possibilities, so both are considered and the better possibility used. Additionally, all changes to the theory must have support from multiple examples. These two principles allow learning from imperfect data. The Minimum Description Length principle is used for selection between possible worlds and determining appropriate levels of additional justification. A new encoding scheme allows the use of MDL within the framework of Inductive Logic Programming.  Examples must be stored to provide additional justification for revisions without violating resource requirements. A new algorithm determines when to discard examples, minimising total usage while ensuring sufficient storage for justifications. Searching for revisions is the most computationally expensive part of the process, yet not all searches are successful. Another new algorithm uses a notion of theory stability as a guide to occasionally disallow entire searches to reduce overall time.  The approach has been implemented as a learner called NILE. Empirical tests include two challenging domains where this type of learner acts as one component of a larger task. The first of these involves recognition of behavior activation conditions in another agent as part of an opponent modeling task. The second, more challenging task is learning to identify objects in visual images by recognising relationships between image features. These experiments highlight NILE'S strengths and limitations as well as providing new  n domains for future work in ILP.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Minimum Description Length (MDL)</field><field name="subject">Learning tasks.</field><field name="subject">Incremental relational learning.</field><field name="subject">Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)</field><field name="subject">NILE.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43513</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Universities as place: an intergenerational perspective on the experience of Australian university students</field><field name="creator">Steinmetz, Christine Ann, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation of the Australian university as place. It is an historical analysis of three generations of Australian undergraduate students and their attachment and sense of belonging to the university (Baby Boomers born 1946-1961, Generation X born 1962-1977 and Generation Y born 1978-1993). This thesis specifically looks at place as being experienced through the university campus (built form) and place as experienced through connections with people (teachers, students, professionals and as alumni). This thesis presents literature reviewed and respective theoretical frameworks regarding the history of universities, place theory and its related constructs and generational social theory. In addition to my own heuristic contribution in which I connect my university experiences to the university as place, the thesis documents the experiences of three living generations of Australian undergraduate students through 36 qualitative in-depth interviews and analyses their perspectives on how they experienced the university as place while they were students. It examines the trajectory of the university experience from 1964 when the Baby Boomers first entered the university system to the current university experience with students from Generation Y. The thesis is also a comprehensive blend of progressive commentary from in-depth expert interviews selected from demography, higher education, youth, campus planning, and society.  The thesis demonstrates that the university as place can be manifested in attachment to the built form, significant and meaningful connections with members of the university community. However, how each generation felt connected, why they were attached to certain places, who they formed significant relationships with, when they most felt like they belonged, and what they considered meaningful in their undergraduate years at university differed. The thesis contends that generational perspectives on the university as place are inextricably linked to the attitude and beliefs of the generational cohort to which one belongs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intergenerational</field><field name="subject">University</field><field name="subject">Place</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43538</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neuroblastoma tumorigenesis: arrested differentiation as a mechanism of disease, and a treatment target</field><field name="creator">Raif, Anna, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The molecular mechanisms of neuroblastoma tumorigenesis include arrested neuritic differentiation, making an attractive strategy for treatments which promote differentiation of this childhood disease. The N-Myc oncoprotein has an established role in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis, although the exact mechanism is poorly defined. Treatment side-effects are extensive in treatment of children receiving conventional chemo-radiotherapy for neuroblastoma. Retinoids have a low side-effect profile and are used in children with neuroblastoma at the point of minimal residual disease. Retinoids can simultaneously combat N-Myc effects, induce differentiation, growth inhibition, and, cause cancer cell death. Retinoid Acid Receptor beta (RAR&#946;) is an important mediator of the retinoid anti-cancer effect in neuroblastoma cells. I have found that perinatal environmental factors such as hypoxia and nutrient reduction can contribute to neuroblastoma initiation by conferring resistance to a subsequent physiologic death stimulus of NGF withdrawal. We also concluded that transient N-myc expression perinatally may play a central role in neuroblastoma initiation, for it was instrumental in rendering death resistance towards a range of different stress stimuli. We hypothesise that the effects of transient perinatal stress on ganglia cells may be mimicked by the transient N-Myc expression reproduced in the N-Myc mouse model. I also found that five known N-Myc  transcriptional target genes (ODC1, MCM7, MRP1, hTERT and &#945;-Prothymosin) are over-expressed in perinatal paravertebral ganglia fromJhe N-Myc mouse model. I also identified Myc Box" domain of the N-Myc protein as being necessary for resistance to NGF withdrawal.  I also sought to better understand the mechanisms of retinoid differentiation treatment for disease. We sought to define the role of a novel retinoid co-regulator, Estrogen-Responsive B Box Protein (EBBP), in the propagation of the retinoid differentiation anti-cancer signal. We hypothesized that EBBP over-expression can restore retinoid sensitivity in vitro in retinoid-resistant cells, and, that retinoid resistance can be overcome by EBBP over-expression in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), a demethylating agent or a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. In order to address these hypotheses, we used a panel of retinoid-resistant lung and breast cancer cell lines transiently transfected with either a control plasmid or EBBP plasmid. We then employed Real Time PCR, BrdU, Alamar Blue and cell death detection assays to investigate the effect of EBBP over-expression on RAR&#946; transcription, cell proliferation, cell viability, apoptosis and necrosis in the presence, or absence, of atRA, a demethylating agent (5-Aza), or a HDAC inhibitor (Trichostatin A, TSA). We found that EBBP over-expression can increase sensitivity to TSA and all trans retinoic acid (atRA) treatment, reduce cell proliferation and viability, trigger cell death, and, more importantly induce RAR&#946; and Retinoic Acid Hydroxylase (CYP26A) transcription ,in RA-resistant cancer cells. We conclude that while EBBP can augment some of the effects of existing treatment agents, it may resent a novel target for differentiation therapy in retinoid-resistant cancer cells.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer cells</field><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma tumorigeneis</field><field name="subject">Retinoids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43639</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A technical feasibility study of an automated evaluation system for assessing the care needs of residents living in Australian residential aged care facilities</field><field name="creator">Chan, Leroy Lai-Yu, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">An aging population is one common challenge faced by many developed countries including Australia. The Australian government has realised that the existing healthcare system must be improved to provide better support longer-term for the healthcare needs of this population. This research examines one such opportunity by suggesting a reform on how the care needs of residents living in Australian residential aged care facilities (RACF) are assessed. A recent study has shown that the current assessment system, known as the Residential Classification Scale (RCS), is subjected to high administrative procedural overhead costs and significant deviations in assessment results. This thesis documents a technical feasibility study of a novel method aimed to solve issues related to the time demands and subjectivity of the RCS through the design and implementation of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). This WSN is engineered to unobtrusively collect data from wireless sensor nodes either embedded in the RACF environment or attached to the resident??s body. The collected data can be potentially used to provide automatic and accurate care level assessments for the resident. The methodology of preparing and conducting the experiments to prove the hypotheses is justified and described, including the experimental instruments and procedures involved. The results show that this WSN surpasses similar research systems in terms of its application scale, the number and types of sensor nodes involved and the complexity of its hardware and firmware architectures. The major contributions of this thesis are: ??	The WSN developed satisfies certain technical requirements to be declared fit for use in a mock Australian RACF. ??	The WSN provides high sensor detection accuracies (between 88% and 100%), superior location tracking capability (94.75%) and activities of daily living inference capability over similar studies. Opportunities for further improvements of this WSN include: ??	Fine tuning the detection accuracy of Passive Infra-red (PIR) motion sensors. ??	Minimising the down time of the sensor nodes due to firmware memory leak. ??	An extra location tracking mechanism to improve location accuracy determination.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ZigBee</field><field name="subject">Wireless Sensor Networks</field><field name="subject">Telehealth</field><field name="subject">Residential Aged Care</field><field name="subject">Activities of Daily Living</field><field name="subject">Wellness Monitoring</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43543</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic chain transfer polymerisation in C02-expanded monomers</field><field name="creator">Zwolak, Grzegorz, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Experimental data on the solubility of CO2 in methyl methacrylate (MMA) and butyl methacrylate (BMA) are reported at temperatures from 308 to 333 K and pressures in the range of 1 to 10 MPa. The corresponding measurements of the volumetric expansion of the liquid phase are also presented. The solubility data are correlated with the Peng-Robinson equation of state using two interaction parameters. Solubilities of CO2 as high as 80 mol% can be attained in both monomers in the range of pressure considered. A near-linear relationship is observed between pressure and liquid-phase composition. The Peng-Robinson equation of state provides a satisfactory correlation of the solubility data. The average absolute relative deviations with respect to the calculated values of pressure are less than 2%. For a given monomer, the expansion isotherms coincide when plotted as a function of the liquid - phase composition.  Catalytic chain transfer (CCT) polymerisation of CO2-expanded MMA, BMA and styrene is then described. Experimental values of the chain transfer constant are determined at 323 K and 333 K and in the range of pressure from 0.1 to 6 MPa. A cobaloxime complex is used as the chain transfer catalyst. The effect of small quantities of polymer on the volumetric expansion of the corresponding monomer is considered. The chain transfer constants for the expanded monomers are significantly higher than those obtained in the bulk monomers. It is demonstrated that a linear relationship exists between the chain transfer rate coefficient and the inverse of liquid-phase viscosity. These results provide significant evidence that the rate-determining step in the CCT process is diffusion-controlled.  Finally, molecular weight evolution in CCT polymerization of CO2-expanded MMA is reported. Experimental molecular weight and polydispersity index data are presented at 323 K in the range of conversion from 1 to 25%, and at pressures of 5 and 6 MPa. Both molecular weight and polydispersity increase with conversion at conditions below the homogeneous expansion limit. Predici simulations suggest that either irreversible catalyst deactivation or cobalt-carbon bond formation is the most likely mechanism for the increase in molecular weight with conversion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Butyl methacrylate (BMA)</field><field name="subject">CO2.</field><field name="subject">Methyl methacrylate (MMA)</field><field name="subject">Peng-Robinson equation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The spectrum of substance use risk among in and out of treatment drug using populations and the role of service provider in optimising the potential benefits of treatment through enhancing treatment knowledge, satisfaction and adherence.</field><field name="creator">Winstock, Adam Rohan, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis comprises 4 book chapters, 29 research papers and 5 published letters. It comprises two discreet bodies of work that address the spectrum of drug use from marginalized populations with injecting drug use and opioid dependence to generally healthier, less stigmatized, out of treatment drug users associated with dance music scene. Both populations face a dynamic spectrum of risks that may, to varying degrees, be modifiable by behavioural change and education which may lead to tangible improvements in the delivery of health services and treatment outcomes. The first part of this thesis comprises 2 book chapters, 11 peer reviewed publications and 3 letters addressing the epidemiology and risks associated with drug use amongst those associated with the dance music scene in the United Kingdom In 1999 I commenced a serial study of club drug use through the use of an annual survey in a popular dance music magazine. This 7 year project generated 9 data based peer reviewed publications. During the study period over 5000 participants completed a questionnaire that addressed a number of drug related issues including patterns and prevalence of substance use and associated risk behaviours including alcohol use and high risk sexual practises. The serial collection of data permitted time trend analysis to be performed and demonstrated the utility of such approaches in the detection of emerging drug trends and the appearance novel substances of abuse such as 4-MTA. The second section comprises 2 book chapters, 18 published papers and 2 letters. The research papers focus on 2 aspects of opioid treatment. The first series(papers 15-27) concern the range and structure of service provision for those with opioid dependence within the public health system in Australia (and to the lesser extent the UK) and consumers' satisfaction, knowledge and understanding of that treatment. The second series (29-34) address opioid substitution medication diversion with a focus on buprenorphine diversion and non adherence to treatment. These two discreet areas support the optimisation of health outcomes obtainable through the provision of opioid substitution treatment while minimizing the harms to individuals and the wider community associated with non adherence to treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43551</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation of visual as concept and practice in art education</field><field name="creator">Barbousas, Joanna, Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the formation of visual as discursive practice.

With a particular focus on Michel Foucault's methods of history, archaeology and genealogy, art education as discipline is mapped through an investigation of visual as concept and practice.  This research contends that the emergence of current practices in visual culture, as configured within the constraints of art education amplifies the conditions of visual to define art education as a field. It examines the mobilisation of discourse, verified by discipline formations in art education, and the way in which such formations distribute and categorise knowledge that is sequenced within power structures. Therefore, visual, as a discursive practice is one way through which to trace the conditions of the field, including the structure of discipline as knowledge and subject in art education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Michel Foucault.</field><field name="subject">Visual.</field><field name="subject">Art education.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the periphery of space</field><field name="creator">Nheu, Anie, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Abstract is not available.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Space and time in art</field><field name="subject">Drawing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43554</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Running out: conceptual behavior and writing in digital sculpture</field><field name="creator">Kan, Philip, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Artists apply the elements of everyday life from their environment into artworks. This transformation of facts in their artworks becomes part of the artist's everyday life. The idea of conceptual behaviour applied to everyday life is the cornerstone of my creative process. The idea of conceptual behaviour in my work is inspired by the movement of conceptual art. I believe a form of conduct appears during the process of creation and this is what I have investigated.  I was born and grew up in Hong Kong until I was 16 and then moved to Australia. Due to this background, I find myself running between two languages: Chinese is my native language and English is the language for my everyday living. Wherever I travel in different regions, the situation persists.  Writing is one of the important factors in my work. There are other forms of written languages and experimental writings in this series of work, for example; newspaper texts from general media, videotexts and form of video writing collaborate with digital media, and calligraphy from Chinese language. Calligraphy becomes a form of performance during the process of this piece of work. This process documented by video camcorder, a tool in digital media.   Digital elements play a critical role in this creation. There are certain formats of digital elements involved. They include, video collage with different visual resources, documentary of the process, split screen projections in further phase of process and the whole series of works presented as embedded video.  Another important element in my work is the idea of embedded video as a form of sculpture. Embedded video is introduced by merging digital media with sculptural forms.

The central aims of this research are to investigate the materiality of stone through the 'disciplines of painting and drawing, and the influence of the compositional concept of figure and ground in constructing the imagery.  The written research provides a brief overview of geology as a scientific context for the conception and content of the images in the body of work. The formative processes that contribute to the materiality of stone are examined and the role of geological time frames in challenging the perception of stone as unchanging is described. The relevance of the geological processes of metamorphoses and mutability to the conceptual and visual structure of the images is examined.  The body of work from the research project is contextually positioned within a comparative survey of imaging nature in the Renaissance, the period of the Enlightenment, and the 20th and 21st centuries.  The concept of figure and ground is examined. analysing its implications in philosophy, science, psychology and psychoanalysis. The centrality of the concept as a compositional and psychological strategy in image making is considered in relation to a range of 20th and 21st century paintings, including those from this research project.  The significance of employing contemporary types of mapping in making of images referring to the natural environment, and the effect that these types of mapping have when applied to pictorial construction, is considered.

But like most developed economy health care systems, it has experienced a continual increase in demand for health care services along with increased pressure to improve efficiency, quality, and sustainability. To assist in health sector management, policy formulation, investment decisions and reform, the Australian government developed the National Health Performance Framework (NHPF). The NHPF employs performance indicators across nine dimensions of health care, including Effectiveness, Appropriateness, Efficiency, Responsiveness, Accessibility, Safety, Continuity, Capability, and Sustainability. While the National Health Performance Committee has recognised that performance indicators used within the NHPF are inadequate, this thesis argues that the solution is not a simple matter of collecting additional data and constructing new and ???improved??? indicators. Due to resource constraints within the health care system there is an implicit performance trade-off across dimensions. The NHPF must take into consideration the value individuals place on the health care dimensions to enable a shift of limited resources to those areas that are most valued. The starting point for the NHPF should be to determine what society wants out of a health system.  The purpose of this thesis is to determine Australian society???s preferences for performance across the nine NHPF dimensions of health care. This is achieved using a choice modelling experiment, which describes the performance of the current health care system and alternative health care systems the government could work towards, and asks respondents to compare and choose which system they prefer. A mixed multinomial logit model is used to analyse respondent choices in order to incorporate alternative tastes across attributes, and correlation of tastes across alternatives and scenarios. Relative values attached to the nine NHPF dimensions of health care are calculated and preferences for the dimensions are ranked.  The thesis concludes by exploring individual preferences derived form the choice modelling experiment in the context of social welfare theory. It also outlines the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology, provides suggestions for further research, and offers a use for social preferences in the development of performance frameworks within the Australian health care system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Performance framework</field><field name="subject">Social preferences</field><field name="subject">Discrete choice experiment</field><field name="subject">Health care system</field><field name="subject">Resource allocation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43565</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pricing or mispricing of earnings quality in Australia</field><field name="creator">Wong, Leon Keat Leong, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the pricing (or mispricing) of earnings quality in Australia.

Ten earnings quality constructs are studied: total accruals, unexpected accruals, cash-to-profit, accrual quality, persistence, predictability, smoothness, relevance, conservatism and timeliness.  In the cost of equity pricing tests, when earnings quality is proxied using one construct (accrual quality), it is found to be associated with the cost of equity.  However, when the additional nine constructs are included in the regression models, accrual quality loses statistical significance.  Various other constructs are found to be associated with the cost of equity depending on the choice of the cost of equity proxy.  In the trading strategy tests, there is some initial evidence of trading strategy opportunities for firms with high quality earnings.  However, after deleting outlier observations with annual buy-and-hold returns of greater than 200% the potential for earning abnormal returns from a hedge portfolio strategy disappears.  The existence of Australian evidence on the accruals anomaly provides a convenient basis to validate the results of the earnings quality trading strategy tests.  Although no clear evidence on the accruals anomaly is found, results are obtained which appear to be consistent with prior Australian evidence of the accruals anomaly, depending on the research design choices made.  Overall, the evidence on whether earnings quality is priced or mispriced in Australia is best viewed as inconclusive.  It highlights the importance of conducting thorough robustness tests and suggests a need for caution by researchers in making inferences from a narrow set of earnings quality constructs and research design specifications.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cost of equity</field><field name="subject">Earnings quality</field><field name="subject">Trading strategies</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43569</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An inquiry into the study of visual communication by international asian students within the context of an Australian university</field><field name="creator">McWhinnie, Louise J. I., Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Extant bodies of research identify the dilemmas encountered by, and adaptive strategies of international Asian students (IAS) undertaking second language undergraduate study. However no substantive research has explored the existence of subject specific dilemmas that such students encounter in the study of design within a western setting. Doctoral work exploring design education is rare. This study addresses the gap in the research record by investigating the specifics of the study of visual communication by IAS attending an Australian university. Through the voices of the IAS and academics, the specific nature of the manifestation, understanding and misunderstanding of such dilemmas is explored. Together with the investigation of visual communication, the author discloses the nature of perception and misconception between a group of design academics and a cohort of IAS.  The study uses complementary methodologies, synthesising quantitative and qualitative data. The study's statistical data was generated from 460 first and second year student surveys. This was undertaken over a three-year period, with resultant data sub-categorised to enable a representation of the IAS to emerge through identification of their particular motivations, expectations and actualisation of dilemmas within the context of the wider undergraduate cohort.  The author develops and utilises an explanatory framework after Pierre Bourdieu, to analyse data emanating from interviews with multiple participants of an established population of academics and IAS. She explores the perceptions of their realities and the construction of their representations, as located through both their convergence and divergence.  The study's paradigm is constructed by the field of design, as an objective world and site of the inquiry. Viewing the study's data through this conceptual framework, the author constructs a representation of the field and educational site using socio-cultural structures and the populations' multiple realities. The study reports on the layers and contradictions of communication, miscommunication, myth and fiction, constructed through the educational field. This is further interrogated to reveal the arbitrary structure of the field, its pedagogy and creation of its internal logic by which the field is perpetuated and student performances reproduced.  The outcomes of the investigation include a detailed identification of lA design students' disclosures of the dilemmas of expectation versus experience, and the systematic misperception of paradoxes within the pedagogy of visual communication, presented as convergent and divergent expectations of the IAS and academics.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual communication</field><field name="subject">Asian students -- Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43574</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A discrete-time robust extended kalman filter for estimation of nonlinear uncertain systems</field><field name="creator">Kallapur, Abhijit, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a novel approach to the problem of state estimation for  discrete-time nonlinear systems in the presence of large model uncertainties.  Though classical nonlinear Kalman filters such as the extended Kalman filter  (EKF) can handle uncertainties by increasing the value of noise covariances, this  is only applicable to systems with small uncertainties. To this end, a discretetime  robust extended Kalman filter (REKF) is formulated and applied to examples  from the fields of aerospace engineering and signal processing with an  emphasis on attitude estimation for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and  image processing under the influence of atmospheric turbulence.  The robust filter is an approximate set-valued state estimator where the Riccati  and filter equations are obtained as an approximate solution to a reverse-time  optimal control problem defining the set-valued state estimator. The advantages  of the REKF over the classical EKF are investigated for examples from the fields  aerospace engineering and signal processing where large model uncertainties are  introduced. In the case of small UAVs, an alternative attitude estimation algorithm  based on the REKF is proposed in the event of gyroscopic failure and  the inability of the vehicle to carry redundant sensors due to limited payload  capabilities. In the case of image reconstruction under atmospheric turbulence, a  robust pixel-wandering (random shifts) scheme is proposed to aid the process of  image reconstruction. Also, problems pertaining to platform vibration analysis  for aerospace vehicles and a frequency demodulation process in the presence of  channel-induced uncertainties is also discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nonlinear systems</field><field name="subject">Kalman filtering</field><field name="subject">Robust Extended Kalman filters</field><field name="subject">Signal processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44095</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economic impacts of China's pension reform: provincial and national contexts</field><field name="creator">Lu, Bei, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis provides a range of analyses to examine the current Chinese pension reform in both provincial and national contexts, with special emphasis on coverage increase and its long term financial implications. Quantitative assessment includes econometric analysis of survey data initiated and organized by the author and her colleagues. Special models are designed to reflect the transitional characteristics of the current Chinese pension system. The results confirm that the coverage increase delays the system-aging process, through labor migration and urbanization, by about 20 years. But a funding crisis is inevitable if no parametric reforms could be made in the current system and if the system is not well managed. Policy suggestions are made in line with the empirical analysis and model results.  In addition, some structural pension reform options are discussed. Two Notional Defined Contribution (NDC) applications are presented and simulations indicate that an NDC system may be effective in smoothing the financial pressure for government while maintaining adequate levels of individual retirement benefit. In the final part of the thesis, a hypothetical safety net is assessed in the context of the current policy framework, and its cost is examined. The thesis introduces new data and first hand information about Chinese pension reform in a provincial context to reflect the features of the national system.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Retirement benefit.</field><field name="subject">Chinese pension system.</field><field name="subject">National Defined Contribution.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43590</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design and control of autonomous crop tracking robotic weeder : GreenWeeder</field><field name="creator">Dang, Kim Son, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis reports the design and control of the ??GreenWeeder??, a non-herbicidal autonomous weeding robot, in order to autonomously track crop rows for weeding through electrocution in the inter-row space. The four wheel mobile robot platform was designed and built with a motorised Ackerman steering system allowing the robot to steer up to 30 degree left and right. It was also equipped with an electronically geared rear wheel drive, a pair of stereo cameras, a SICK LMS-291 laser range finder to localize itself with respect to the crop rows, a GPS system for obtaining the robot position in the field and a long-range communication system for tele-supervision by operators. The first prototype of the robot electrocution system was also designed and constructed to ignite 22kV electrical arcs to destroy weeds. Its operation was tested in the research field of the University of Sydney and the results of this experiment were analysed to improve the efficiency of this first prototype. An improved prototype of the electrocution system was then constructed and attached to a cradle extending out at the back of the mobile robot platform. The testing of this improved prototype was conducted at Lansdowne farm, a research field of the University of Sydney.  After the construction of the robot platform, the robot control was considered with the demands for robot localization with respect to crop rows, an autonomously tracking control system and a manual control mode in order to take the robot to transportation vehicles. Firstly, the robot localization was accomplished by utilizing SICK LMS-291 laser range finder sensor for the sensing and perception of the robot. Secondly, the robot control system was developed with a PID controller, a second order model of the robot system and a first order filter. The PID controller is in the standard form with the filtered derivative and the PI part being in automatic reset configuration. The second order model was identified using Matlab System Identification toolbox based on the robot kinematic analysis. The first order filter is utilized for filtering out the lateral deviations of the robot with respect to the crop rows received from the SICK laser sensor. A Simulink simulation model of the robot control system was also built in order to fine-tune PID and  filter parameters. Thirdly, the manual control mode of the robot was produced. In this mode, a joystick can be attached to a notebook to wirelessly drive the robot around or it can be plugged into a USB port at the back of the robot to drive it without the notebook. After the robot control was implemented and simulated, some experiments were conducted with the robot autonomously tracking  a strip of reflective tape mimicking a crop row stuck into the ground of a laboratory. Depending on distances from the row assigned to the controller, the robot tried to keep those distances away from the row. The results showed the lateral errors of the robot with respect to the row were approximately 4.5 cm which were sufficient for our current agricultural application.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">System identification</field><field name="subject">Crop tracking</field><field name="subject">Autonoumous weeder</field><field name="subject">PID control</field><field name="subject">Weed electrocution</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44418</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using formal management accounting controls to account for value in kind in inter-organisational alliances : a case study of the Sydney 2000 olympic games</field><field name="creator">Burfitt, Brian Anthony, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the role of management accounting control practices in interorganisational alliances (IOAs) involving non-cash, &#145;value in kind&#146; (VIK) transactions. The research involves a retrospective case study of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, which examines how the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, (SOCOG), managed and accounted for over $360 million of VIK. The case study is based on document study and interviews with individuals involved with this aspect of the 2000 Olympic Games.  Following a review of previous research concerning both the life cycle (Das and Teng 2002, Moores and Yuen 2001) and the nature of formal accounting controls (Dekker 2004) in IOAs, two research questions are developed. Firstly, what kinds of formal accounting controls are required to manage VIK over the life cycle of an IOA? Secondly, how are extant accounting controls localised through the practice of managing VIK?  This thesis finds the VIK resources are significant to the recipient parties and the IOAs in general. These VIK transactions, however, have been overlooked in previous accounting research with little significant recognition in prior studies or contemporary professional discourse. There is a lack of directly transferable expertise from traditional accounting practices in relation to the following aspects of the management and control of VIK &#150; recognition, planning/budgeting, procedures/rules and performance monitoring. Formal control activities were all experimented with and improvised in order to deal with the challenges presented by the significance of VIK. A &#145;drift&#146; in accounting technologies has been documented by this study (Andon et al 2007).  Given the potential economic significance of VIK transactions, this suggests a need for both further research and professional discourse in this area to ensure sufficient visibility of, and management planning and control for, VIK transactions. Future research could include studies of: management and control of VIK in real time; provider organisations and the impact of VIK on their formal accounting controls; the role of social or informal controls and trust in negotiating and managing VIK; IOAs involving organisations that are operated as an indefinite going concern and, the recognition, valuation and attestation of VIK resources across a range of organisations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Interorganisational alliances</field><field name="subject">Value In kind</field><field name="subject">Formal management accounting controls</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An engineering approach to modelling ballistic impact on hybrid polymer laminates</field><field name="creator">Banan, Roshan, Aerospace, Civil &amp; Mechanical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Hybrid polymer laminates of polycarbonate and PMMA have generated considerable interest among researchers as an alternative to traditional glass armours because of their potential for reduced cost and weight. Generally, the development of ballistic armour is carried out experimentally which is an expensive task in terms of time and cost. Numerical simulation provides a much greater facility to understand the phenomenon of ballistic impact and the effects of various parameters on the response to such impact. In addition it provides an easy means of comparing the impact performance of different materials as well as combination of materials forming hybrid laminates.  The aim of this research was to develop a numerical modelling capability to simulate the ballistic response of hybrid polymer laminates, specifically polycarbonate and PMMA, using a commercially available finite element code LS-DYNA. The challenge was to work within the limitations of the material models and the failure algorithms available within LS-DYNA, and still try to reproduce the behaviour observed experimentally by previous researchers, initially on monolithic plates of polycarbonate and PMMA and then on hybrid laminates.  The first part of the study focuses on a detailed literature survey on mechanical and dynamic characterisation of polycarbonate and PMMA as well as experimental and numerical studies previously conducted on ballistic behaviour of these materials as well as their combinations. The material properties of the polymers compiled from this literature survey were used as input for the selected LS-DYNA material model.  Impact simulations were carried on monolithic and laminated media of polycarbonate and PMMA and where possible these were compared to experimental results. It was observed that the results agreed with the experimental data qualitatively. Quantitatively the results showed some discrepancies which were attributed to the limitations faced in simulating the exact test conditions numerically.  Numerical simulations were carried out to study the effects of variations in laminate thickness and plate support diameters as well as to examine the influence of the bond between the layers. Finally the impact response of four different combinations of  polycarbonate and PMMA are compared to each other for different laminate thicknesses.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycarbonates : Impact testing, mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Laminated materials : Impact testing, mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Polymethylmethacrylate : Impact testing , mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Polymeric composites : Impact testing, mathematical models.</field><field name="subject">Ballistics : Armor, impact testing.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44094</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A molecular investigation of dispersal, drift and selection to aid management of an invasion in progress</field><field name="creator">Rollins, Lee Ann, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Invasive species are problematic but their control can be difficult. When the history and dynamics of invasive populations are unknown, analytical techniques utilising genetic data can provide information to management. The application of these techniques has typically been limited to species with restricted dispersal or to localised geographic scales. Here these techniques are used in conjunction with traditional approaches to study the invasion of a highly vagile species over a continental scale. Originally introduced to eastern Australia, the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is expanding westward and has reached the southeast agricultural region of Western Australia (WA). Spatial, temporal and museum samples representing historical incursions into WA were used in genetic analyses to answer questions important to WA management agencies. Where possible, multiple marker classes were used to evaluate their relative ability to address these questions, including microsatellites, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and a nuclear gene. Between two and four genetic groups were identified in Australia, and the localities on the edge of the range expansion (ERE) were consistently genetically differentiated from all others. Levels of genetic exchange between groups appeared to be low, suggesting that localised control may be effective. Analyses of historical samples indicated patterns of genetic exchange are temporally stable. This suggests that starlings will continue to arrive from the east, requiring vigilance from management. Consistently, a negative relationship was found between genetic diversity and date of first record, which may help in the future to distinguish ineffective surveillance from recent colonisations. Genetic evidence of female-biased dispersal indicated that control strategies preferentially targeting females may more efficiently limit dispersal than those targeting both sexes equally. Variants private to particular genetic groups were identified; tracking the spread of these variants may assist future monitoring programs in understanding ongoing exchange between groups. One mtDNA variant private to ERE localities showed dramatic temporal change, which could not be adequately explained by genetic drift or admixture, but may be explained by selection. Microsatellites were most useful in determining origins and identifying dispersers, mtDNA sequences provided a unique tool for ongoing monitoring of dispersal, and nuclear sequences had high levels of gene diversity and resolution of population structure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sturnus vulgaris.</field><field name="subject">Population genetics.</field><field name="subject">Invasive species.</field><field name="subject">Range expansion.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43762</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A presentation service for rapidly building interactive collaborative web applications</field><field name="creator">Sweeney, Michael, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Web applications have become a large segment of the software development domain  but their rapid rise in popularity has far exceeded the support in software engineering.

This  is essential for the implementation of well-targeted catchment-management decisions.  This thesis investigates the nature and timing of catchment response to human activities  by examining changes in sediment sources and sinks in a dry-tropical subcatchment of  the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchment area, in northeastern Australia.  Changes in catchment sediment sources, both in terms of spatial provenance and erosion  type, are determined using sediment tracing techniques. Results indicate that changes in  sediment source contributions over the last 250 years can be linked directly to changes  in catchment land use. Sheetwash and rill erosion from cultivated land (40-60%) and  channel erosion from grazed areas (30-80%) currently contribute most sediment to the  river system. Channel erosion, on a basin-wide scale, appears to be more important  than previously considered in this region of Australia.  Optically stimulated luminescence and 137Cs dating are used to determine pre-and post- European settlement (ca. 1850) alluvial sedimentation rates. The limitations of using  137Cs as a floodplain sediment dating tool in a low fallout environment, dominated by  sediment derived from channel and cultivation sources, are identified. Low magnitude  increases in post-disturbance floodplain sedimentation rates (3 to 4 times) are attributed  to the naturally high sediment loads in the dry-tropics. These low increases suggest that  previous predictions which reflect order of magnitude increases in post-disturbance  sediment yields are likely to be overestimates. In-channel bench deposits, formed since  European settlement, are common features that appear to be important stores of recently  eroded material. The spatially distributed erosion/sediment yield model SedNet is applied, both with  generic input parameters and locally-derived data. Outputs are evaluated against  available empirically-derived data. The results suggest that previous model estimates  using generic input parameters overestimate post-disturbance and underestimate predisturbance  sediment yields, exaggerating the impact of European catchment  disturbance. This is likely to have important implications for both local-scale and  catchment-wide management scenarios in the GBR region. Suggestions for future study  and the collection of important empirical data to enable more accurate model  performance are made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human impact on watersheds : Central Queensland</field><field name="subject">Watersheds : Central Queensland</field><field name="subject">Sedimentation and deposition : Central Queensland</field><field name="subject">Catchment sediment : Central Queensland</field><field name="subject">Water catchment management : Central Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43622</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Chlorination of Titanium Oxycarbide and Oxycarbonitride</field><field name="creator">Adipuri, Andrew, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The project undertook a systematic study of chlorination of titanium oxycarbide and oxycarbonitride with the aim to develop further understanding of kinetics and mechanisms of the chlorination reactions. The project studied titania, ilmenite ores, and synthetic rutile reduced by carbon in argon and nitrogen and chlorinated at different temperatures, gas flow rates and compositions. Chlorination of titanium suboxides, iron and impurities in ilmenite was also examined. Chlorination of titanium oxycarbide Ti(O,C) or oxycarbonitride Ti(O,C,N) can be implemented at 200 to 400 deg.C, while the commercial chlorination process in the production of titanium metal or titania pigment requires 800 to 1100 deg.C. This makes chlorination of Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) an attractive technology in processing of titanium minerals. Chlorination reaction is strongly exothermal, which increased the sample temperature up to 200 deg.C above the furnace temperature. The chlorination of Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) was ignited at 150 deg.C to 200 deg.C depending on the sample composition. Their chlorination at 235 deg.C to 400 deg.C was close to completion in less than 30 min. The chlorination rate of titanium oxycarbide or oxycarbonitride increased with increasing gas flow rate. Sample composition had a significant effect on the extent of chlorination. The optimum results were obtained for titanium oxycarbide or oxycarbonitride produced with carbon to titania molar ratio of 2.5; these samples contained no detectable excess of carbon or unreduced titanium suboxides. In chlorination of reduced ilmenite ores and synthetic rutile, Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N), metallic iron and Ti2O3 were chlorinated. The rate and extent of chlorination of titanium increased with increasing carbon to TiO2 ratio.  Chlorination of Ti2O3 was slow relative to Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) and iron; chlorination of impurity oxides such as MgO, SiO2 and Al2O3 was not observed. The project also examined chlorination of Ti(O,C) or Ti(O,C,N) in ilmenite ore and synthetic rutile after removal of iron, which was achieved by aerated leaching of reduced samples in heated flask containing 0.37 M of ammonium chloride solution. Iron removal from the ilmenite ore or synthetic rutile resulted in higher rate and extent of chlorination of titanium oxycarbide or oxycarbonitride.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Carbothermal reduction</field><field name="subject">Mineral processing</field><field name="subject">Ore treatment</field><field name="subject">Chlorination</field><field name="subject">Titanium oxycarbide</field><field name="subject">Titanium oxycarbonitride</field><field name="subject">Titanium tetrachloride</field><field name="subject">Extractive metallurgy</field><field name="subject">Leaching</field><field name="subject">Titanium</field><field name="subject">Titania</field><field name="subject">Titanium oxide</field><field name="subject">Ilmenite</field><field name="subject">Rutile</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The next pregnancy after an unexplained stillbirth : empirical studies of obstetricians' and womens' wishes for management</field><field name="creator">Robson, Stephen James, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background  Unexplained stillbirth is the largest contributor to perinatal death, accounting for one third of stillbirths. Although prognostic information is limited, there is no increase in perinatal death rates in subsequent pregnancies after an unexplained stillbirth. However, those pregnancies have increased rates of preterm birth, low birthweight, induced labour, instrumental and caesarean delivery, 'fetal distress,' and postpartum haemorrhage. These outcomes might be iatrogenic, caused by obstetric intervention.  Aims  1. To examine obstetricians' and womens' wishes for management in pregnancies  subsequent to an unexplained stillbirth, and whether these might contribute to an increase in rates of intervention.  2. To examine whether socio-demographic factors, or how women perceive that an unexplained stillbirth was managed, influence how women want their next pregnancy managed.  3. To assess whether management of unexplained stillbirth differs according to model of care, or country where the event occurred. Methods  1. An anonymous postal survey of all Australian obstetricians to determine   recommended  management of the next pregnancy after an unexplained stillbirth.  2. An Internet-based survey of women after an unexplained stillbirth, seeking details about their wishes for subsequent pregnancy management.  Results  1. Obstetricians' survey  Early pregnancy managements were little different from standard care of low-risk pregnancy. Increased 'fetal surveillance' (by ultrasound, cardiotocography, and formal fetal movement charting) in late pregnancy was recommended by most respondents. Induction of labour would be offered by 93% of respondents, as early as 37 weeks by one third. More than one third of obstetricians would offer elective caesarean delivery, with 13% offering this before 38 weeks.  2. Womens'survey  93% of respondents wanted 'testing' over and above normal pregnancy care in their next pregnancy. 81% of respondents wanted early delivery, and 26% wanted a caesarean delivery, irrespective of obstetric indications. These wishes were not influenced by socio-demographic factors, management of the index stillbirth (with the exception of having  had a caesarean delivery), or advice received about management of the next pregnancy (with the exception of being advised to have an early or caesarean delivery).  Conclusions  Both obstetricians and the women they care for wanted increased fetal surveillance and early delivery, but not necessarily elective caesarean section. These practices have the potential to increase the rate of intervention, with consequent adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pregnancy management.</field><field name="subject">Stillbirth.</field><field name="subject">Perinatal death.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43655</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The regulation of Saxitoxin production in Cyanobacteria</field><field name="creator">Cavaliere, Rosalia, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Aquatic microalgae produce a variety of toxic secondary metabolites, which are a concern for public health and seafood industries, while also presenting a source of pharmacologically valuable compounds. The present study deals with the physiology and molecular genetics of saxitoxin (STX), a cyanobacterial neurotoxic alkaloid. Ecological and chemical parameters have been investigated for their effects on growth and STX production in the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii T3, in order to better understand the physiological responses of this cyanobacterium to the anthropogenic eutrophication of water bodies. The results indicated that phosphate, in particular, had an incremental effect on STX production, as well as promoting the up-regulation of transcription of the STX biosynthetic gene cluster (sxt). High temperature was found to negatively affect growth and STX production in this organism. The effects of the plant hormone, jasmonic acid, were also tested, since it has previously been shown to affect plant alkaloid production. The hypothesised similarity between cyanobacterial and plant secondary metabolism in response to this plant hormone was confirmed in the neurotoxic cyanobacterium, C. raciborskii T3, as well as the non-toxic Anabaena sp. PCC7120. Furthermore, investigation of the sxt gene cluster transcriptional map in C. raciborskii T3 was carried out, with identification of three main polycistronic and one monocistronic transcripts. Promoter regions putatively involved in the regulation of STX production in C. raciborskii T3 were also identified. Transcription factor consensus motifs, the pho boxes, were identified in the main promoter region. These conserved motifs are the binding regions for the transcriptional regulator, PhoB, to the pho regulon genes, involved in phosphate uptake during conditions of its depletion in the environment. Moreover, a genomic region adjacent to the sxt gene cluster in C. raciborskii T3 was identified and characterised, putatively encoding a regulatory two-component system. This system appears to be involved in the sensing of environmental signals, in particular depleted phosphate, while activating the transcription of genes involved in its uptake and transport.

Through a series of experimental burns, the issues of tree damage are addressed and minimum tree sizes are recommended that are capable of withstanding the effects of low to moderate intensity fires. Data was collected between 2005 and 2007 over six sites, two species, and three age classes. Tree response results came from multiple measurements of over 1700 individual trees. The fuel characteristics commonly found in sub-tropical eucalypt plantations from age four to eleven are described and quantified. These fuel characteristics are related to fire behaviour and new fire behaviour models, specific to young eucalypt plantations, are presented. The fuel characteristics that most influence fire behaviour in young eucalypt plantations are fuel load, fuel height, and fuel moisture content. These characteristics can be used to predict the rate of spread of a plantation fire under benign wind conditions. A novel technique for assessing the extent of stem damage in eucalypts is developed and described. This technique enables immediate assessment of stem damage following fire; previous assessment techniques recommend waiting a considerable period of time (up to 2 years) until dead bark dropped off and fire scars were evident. This new assessment technique is likely to be suitable for post-fire assessment of any eucalypt species and will provide forest managers with the capability of deciding whether to leave a stand to ???grow-on??? or commence recovery operations. Minimum stem sizes recommended to ensure no long-term damage are between 5 ??? 8 cm DBH (diameter at breast height, i.e. 1.3m above ground level) for Eucalyptus dunnii (Dunn???s white gum) and 5 ??? 13 cm DBH for Corymbia spp. (spotted gum) depending on the quantity of fuel around the stem. Stem sizes vary between species because of the variation in bark thickness between species. This thesis provides all the necessary information to conduct prescribed burning operations in young eucalypt plantations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fuels management</field><field name="subject">Eucalypt plantation</field><field name="subject">fire behaviour</field><field name="subject">fire effects</field><field name="subject">fuel characteristics</field><field name="subject">Dunn's white gum</field><field name="subject">Spotted gum</field><field name="subject">fire modelling</field><field name="subject">prescribed burning</field><field name="subject">stem damage</field><field name="subject">tree recovery</field><field name="subject">crown damage</field><field name="subject">sub-tropical</field><field name="subject">Eucalyptus dunnii</field><field name="subject">Corymbia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43663</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus in an antenatal population : an epidemiological study</field><field name="creator">Polis, Suzanne, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although Australian epidemiology of HBV and HCV has been well described for populations groups at higher risk, but the information available for groups generally considered to be lower risk is much more limited. An understanding of the prevalence of these infections and their risk factors in antenatal women is important to guide testing policy and practice. A study was therefore conducted of the epidemiology of hepatitis B and hepatitis C infection in women. In addition, women were asked about their experience with antenatal testing. A total of 516 women participated in the survey, of these 479 (95%) women had been tested for HCV antibodies .The prevalence of HCV antibodies was 4% overall, and 2% among women who were unaware of their HCV status prior to their antenatal test. A history of injecting drug use and residing with a HCV positive person were significantly associated with HCV infection in multivariate analyses. HBV testing was conducted in 468 (99.6%) of women, and the overall prevalence was 2%. Risk factors identified were birthplace in countries of South East Asia. Women were asked about their perception of antenatal testing and pre-test information. Nearly a third (143, 30.5%) of women who had been tested for HCV infection either said that they did not know whether they had been tested, or said that they had declined testing. The corresponding proportion for HBV infection was 28.8% (135). Over 65% and 66% of women said that had not received any information about testing for HCV and HBV respectively. The finding that virtually all antenatal women were being tested for HCV was in contrast to government and non-government organisation policies of ???selective??? screening in place during the study period. Of concern was the substantial proportion of women who were tested despite reporting that they had declined their clinician???s offer to test for HCV and HBV, and the large number of women who reported an absence of pre-test information. Women who said they had received information reported the delivery and quality of information varied according to the antenatal clinician group, but perceived the overall quality as poor.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hepatitis B</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Hepatitis C</field><field name="subject">Prenatal diagnosis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22035</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Robust object tracking using the particle filtering and level set methods</field><field name="creator">Luo, Cheng, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Robust object tracking plays a central role in many applications of image processing, computer vision and automatic control. In this thesis, robust object tracking under complex environments, including heavy clutters in the background, low resolution of the image sequences and non-stationary camera, has been studied. The interest of this study stems from the improvement of the performance of visual tracking using particle filtering.  A Geometric Active contour-based Tracking Estimator, namely GATE, has been developed in order to tackle the problems in robust object tracking where the existence of multiple features or good object detection is not guaranteed. GATE combines particle filtering and the level set-based active contour method. The particle filtering method is able to deal with nonlinear and non-Gaussian recursive estimation problems, and the level set-based active contour method is capable of classifying state space of particle filtering under the methodology of one class classification. By integrating this classifier into the particle filtering, geometric information introduced by the shape prior and pose invariance of the tracked object in the level set-based active contour method can be utilised to prevent the particles corresponding to outlier measurements from being heavily reweighted. Hence, this procedure reshapes and refines the posterior distribution of the particle filtering.  To verify the performance of GATE, the performance of the standard particle filter is compared with that of GATE. Since video sequences in different applications are usually captured by diverse devices, GATE and the standard particle filters with the identical initialisation are studied on image sequences captured by the handhold, stationary and PTZ camera, respectively. According to experimental results, even though a simple color observation model based on the Hue-Saturation-Value (HSV) color histogram is adopted, the newly  developed. GATE significantly improves the performance of the particle filtering for object tracking in complex environments. Meanwhile, GATE initialises a novel approach to tackle the impoverishment problem for recursive Bayesian estimation using sampling method.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">GATE.</field><field name="subject">Robust object tracking.</field><field name="subject">Particle filtering.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43682</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The measurement, creation and manipulation of quantum optical states via photodetection</field><field name="creator">Webb, James, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, we demonstrate an array of photodetection theory and techniques bridging  the traditional discrete and continuous variable experimental domains. In quantum  optics, the creation and measurement of states of light are intertwined and we present  experimental architectures considering both aspects.  We describe the measurement of mean photon numbers at optical sideband frequencies  using homodyne detection. We use our technique to provide a direct comparison to  photon-counting measurements and observe that our technique exhibits superior speed,  dynamic range and mode selectivity compared to photon counters. Our analysis also  rejects a semiclassical description of the vacuum state, with our observations supporting  the quantum mechanical model.  We create a new means of describing the detection ???signatures??? of multi-port networks  of non-photon-number discriminating detectors. Our model includes the practical  effects of loss and dark counts. We use this model to analyse the performance of the loopand  balanced- time-division-multiplexed detector architectures in a projective measurement  role. Our analysis leads us to describe a prescriptive recipe for the optimisation of  each architecture. In light of contemporary technology, we conclude the balanced TDM  detector is the better architecture.  Our analysis is then extended to the tomographic reconstruction of an unknown optical  state using multi-port photon-counting networks. Our new approach is successfully  applied to the reconstruction of the photon statistics of weak coherent states and  demonstrates reduced error and sensitivity to experimental parameter variations than  established techniques.  We report the development of a source of quadrature squeezed vacuum at 1550 nm,  and characterise the squeezing observed at the first 3 free spectral ranges of the downconversion  cavity. This is then used as a source of frequency-entangled photons for a  projective photon subtraction operation described by our earlier theory. We propose a  new hybrid time/frequency domain approach to homodyne detection and illustrate its  application in characterising the prepared state. Our output state has a statistically significant  single photon contribution and permits future experimentation in frequency basis  quantum information.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Photodetection theory</field><field name="subject">Quantum optics</field><field name="subject">Optical detectors</field><field name="subject">Multi-port photon-counting networks</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43686</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Rate-Distortion Optimized Multiple Description Video Codec for Error Resilient Transmission</field><field name="creator">Biswas, Moyuresh , Information Technology &amp; Electrical Engineering, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The demand for applications like transmission and sharing of video is ever-increasing. Although network resources (bandwidth in particular) and coverage, networking technologies, compression ratio of state-of-the-art video coders have improved, unreliability of the transmission medium prevents us from gaining the most benefit from these applications. This thesis introduces a video coder that is resilient to network failures for transmission applications by using the framework of multiple description coding (MDC). Unlike traditional video coding which compresses the video into single bitstream, in MDC the video is compressed into more than one bitstream which can be independently decoded. It not only averages out the effect of network errors over the bitstreams but it also makes it possible to utilize the multipath nature of most network topologies. An end-to-end rate-distortion optimization is proposed for the codec to make sure that the codec exhibits improved compression performance and that the descriptions are equally efficient to improve the final video quality. An optimized strategy for packetizing the compressed bitstreams of the descriptions is also proposed which guarantees that each packet is self-contained and efficient. The evaluation of the developed MD codec over simulated unreliable packet networks shows that it is possible to achieve improved resilience with the proposed strategies and the end video quality is significantly improved as a result. This is further verified with subjective evaluation over a range of different types of video test sequences.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">video coding</field><field name="subject">error resilience</field><field name="subject">multiple description</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43687</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Studying polymer degradation at a molecular level via soft ionisation mass spectrometry</field><field name="creator">Bennet, Francesca, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The present study employs a range of soft-ionisation mass spectrometry techniques to study the degradation of model compounds of poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(n-butyl acrylate) and poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) under conditions designed to simulate the worst-case scenario that would be experienced by a polymer used in a surface coating on a steel roof. Vinyl-terminated and saturated polymers were degraded for periods of up to 2 years under simulated solar radiation at a temperature of 95??C, temperature of 95 ??C in the dark, and simulated solar radiation at 35??C.  Similar degradation mechanisms were observed under heat and UV radiation. The presence of UV radiation accelerated the degradation occurring at high temperature, and vice versa. The combination of heat and UV radiation is far more detrimental to the polymers than either of these conditions alone. Both vinyl-terminated and saturated pMMA degraded under UV radiation at 95??C, whereas under conditions of UV radiation alone or high temperature alone, the saturated polymer was found to be stable. The vinyl-terminated pMMA degrades in all cases via the formation of ethylene oXide-type end groups, which subsequently rearrange under the expulsion of formaldehyde and 2-oxo-propionic acid methyl ester. This is in contrast to all previous literature, in which pMMA degrades via depolymerisation and is stable at 95??C. Degradation of pBA included a degradation mechanism similar to that of pMMA in addition to other polymer fragments, some of which cannot be assigned. pBA (both saturated and vinyl-terminated) showed a tendency to crosslink under all degradation conditions in this study. Only saturated pHEMA was stable under thermal degradation. In all other cases, pHEMA showed some degradation, but displayed a much greater tendency to crosslink rapidly.  Terminal vinyl bonds were shown in all cases to be a weak point in the polymer with respect to degradation. pMMA was found to be the least reactive of these polymers. pHEMA showed some small degradation but had a greater tendency to crosslink via the hydroxyethyl side groups. pBA does not have any such reactive groups, and its crosslinking reaction may be explained via the acrylate backbone, or the longer alkyl ester group.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soft ionisation.</field><field name="subject">Solar radiation.</field><field name="subject">UV radiation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43692</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigation into the feasibility and application of composite materials in conveyor support structures for use in underground coal mines</field><field name="creator">Wootton, Robert James, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Composite materials are well-renown for their strength to weight ratios and are widely used in many industries where high strength and low weight is required. Although steel is the traditional material of choice in the mining industry, and particularly for conveyor support structures, the strength and weight advantages offered by composite materials has prompted this investigation into the feasibility of using composite materials in underground mining conveyor support structures.  The first phase of the project centred on establishing and applying selection criteria for the materials and processes which could be used in such a structure. Key concerns include fire performance, electrical conductivity, cost, availability and manufacturability. Based on these considerations, the project identified a phenolic-glass laminate manufactured using the RTM method (for moulded components) or the pultrusion process (for tube sections) as a possible basis for a composite conveyor support structure.  The second phase of the project developed a set of design criteria for the use of composite materials in conveyor support structures and a series of preliminary designs based on current conveyor configurations. After analysing each preliminary design against key design criteria, in particular cost, weight, assembly time, susceptibility to damage and torsional loading, the Linestand Suspended - Beam configuration was selected as the preferred option.  The third phase of the project used the findings of the preliminary design analysis and the key design criteria to develop a prototype final design. The prototype design is based on a hybrid style of frame. The majority of the structure is constructed from a custom pultruded beam connected with a composite connection piece, while the interface between the rollers and the frame utilises a steel bracket to reduce the risk of damage to the composite frame. The final design is 12kg lighter than the current smaller steel design of similar function.  The project has demonstrated the feasibility of using composite materials in conveyor support structures and the weight savings that may be achieved.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">RTM method.</field><field name="subject">Composite materials.</field><field name="subject">Mining industry.</field><field name="subject">Linesland Suspended - Beam configuration.</field><field name="subject">converyor support structures.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43697</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transient production of biopharmaceutical proteins</field><field name="creator">Wei, Tzu-Hsiang, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The creation of stable mammalian cell lines for biopharmaceutical production often require several months, and is unfavourable for the rapid production of multiple drug candidates for screening in the early stages of development. Biopharmaceutical production by transient transfection provides a possible alternative of quickly producing these early stage drug candidates. The Epi-CHO transient expression system, which consists of a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (CHO-T) expressing the murine polyomavirus Large T-Antigen (LT), emonstrated enhanced transient recombinant protein production. The aim of this study was to prolong transient recombinant protein prod.Jction of the Epi-CHO expression system by creating a CHO cell line expressing both LT and EBNA1 (ECHO-T). The pEBNA1-LT expression vector encoding LT and EBNA1 was constructed and transfected into CHO-K1. A total of 20 clones were isolated from the antibioticresistant pool and screened for the expression of functional LT and EBNA1. PCR analysis showed 16 of the 20 clones was positive for EBNA1 and LT DNA. Of the 16 clones, six were positive for EBNA1 and LT expression by RT-PCR. Detection of LT and EBNA1 by immunofluorescence showed positive staining for the P7-G3 clone. Western blotting suggested the P7-G3 clone was: positive for EBNA1, and clones P3-C7 and P7-E2 were positive for LT. A plasmid replication assay confirmed the expression of functional LT in all six clones. Plasmid maintenance assay confirmed clone P7-G3 as the ECHO-T clones to express functional EBNA1. The P7-G3 clone demonstrated prolonged and sustained transient recombinant protein expression when compared to CHO-T. The P7-G3 clone achieved sustained transient protein expression for 32 days in the absence of selection, the longest currently reported for CHO cells.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Clones.</field><field name="subject">Biopharmaceutical production.</field><field name="subject">Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43708</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Targeting anti-apoptotic mechanisms in malignant gliomas</field><field name="creator">Zielger, David, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Novel strategies for the treatment of malignant gliomas are urgently needed. They are characterised by an inherent resistance to both chemo- and radiotherapeutics resulting in unrelenting tumour progression. While the exact mechanisms of treatment resistance remain undefined, it is now recognized that multiple components within the apoptotic pathway are heavily dysregulated in glioma cells and that the over-expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in patient samples correlates with inferior patient survival. The Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (lAPs) represent the final molecular blockade preventing cellular apoptosis and have been identified as a potential rational therapeutic target in gliomas. The work described herein was focused on the development of novel therapeutic strategies that target the lAPs in malignant gliomas, that are readily translatable to the clinic, and that have the potential to improve patient outcomes.  The first series of studies examined the hypothesis that targeting the lAPs in conjunction with other conventional and targeted therapies would overcome treatment resistance, and enhance anti-tumour activity. The novel, small molecule, lAP inhibitor LBW242 was shown to successfully target the lAPs in glioma cells and inhibit their ability to bind to and inactivate caspases. However when tested as a single agent in vitro, no stand alone anti-glioma activity of LBW242 was demonstrated. A screen of the activity of LBW242 in combination other pro-apoptotic compounds led to the discovery that lAP inhibition applied in combination with receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibition led to enhanced caspase activation and induction of apoptosis with a subsequent synergistic anti-glioma effect. The most profound effect was demonstrated with the specific combination of PDGFR and lAP inhibition both in vitro and in vivo as well as in primary patient derived glioma tumourspheres. While multiple RTKs have previously been validated as rational therapeutic targets, the clinical failure of RTK inhibitors in glioma patients has to date remained unexplained. The results in this thesis provide a novel explanation for the resistance of glioma cells to these targeted therapies, and more importantly offer a clinically tractable strategy of overcoming that resistance and improving patient outcomes.  The second series of studies investigated the mechanism of synergy between lAP and RTK inhibition. The results showed that PDGFR inhibition does not stimulate apoptosis in glioma cells by previously described pathways. A screen of the entire apoptotic pathway revealed that treatment with imatinib modulates the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein NOL3/ARC. The results showed that imatinib treatment leads to down-regulation of NOL3 and that this effect is critical to the synergy between lAP and PDGFR inhibition. Further analysis suggested a critical role for NOL3 in gliomagenesis and treatment resistance NOL3 was found to be highly expressed in malignant gliomas and with expression levels that are inversely correlated with patient outcomes. A role for NOL3 has not previously been described in malignant gliomas.  Finally, a series of studies were undertaken that tested the use of LBW242 in combination with the standard-of-care therapies of irradiation and temozolomide. In vitro assays demonstrated that LBW242 enhanced the pro-apoptotic activity of radiotherapy, and clonogenic assays showed that the combination therapy led to a synergistic anti-glioma effect in multiple glioma cell lines. Athymic mice bearing established human malignant glioma tumour xenografts treated with LBW242 plus radiation and temozolomide demonstrated a profound and synergistic suppression of tumour growth. Neurosphere assays revealed that the combination of radiation and LBW242 led to a pro-apoptotic effect in highly resistant glioma stem cells with a corresponding inhibition of tumour growth. The results indicate a potentially powerful strategy to enhance the therapeutic activity of standard-of-care therapies in glioma patients.  Collectively, the findings of the studies in this thesis contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of treatment resistance in malignant gliomas, and demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic and anti-glioma effects of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and specific targeted therapies can be enhanced by the addition of a novel, small molecule lAP inhibitor. These results are readily translatable to clinical trial, and offer the potential for improved treatment outcomes for glioma patients.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (TTK)</field><field name="subject">Gliomas.</field><field name="subject">Inhibitot of Apoptosis Proteins (IAPs)</field><field name="subject">Apoptotic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43713</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Rehabilitation of the impaired doctor by the New South Wales Medical Board</field><field name="creator">Pethebridge, Andrew, Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The New South Wales Medical Board established a Health Programme for the assessment and rehabilitation of doctors whose clinical performance was impaired by alcohol or psychoactive substance use, mental or physical illness. This programme was developed to be individualized to the needs of each registrant.  The present study has three aims: 1. To describe those doctors who participated in the Board???s Health Programme. 2. To chart the duration of involvement of these doctors through the programme. 3. To examine the outcomes associated with this programme. The study is based on the prospective cohort of all 181 impaired doctors who participated in the Health Programme between July 1st 1993 and April 30th 2001. Information on each registrant was collected at the time of the initial assessment and at each review conducted as part of the programme. Additional qualitative data was  also collected and supplemented by a file audit conducted in August and September 2001.  One hundred and eighty-one doctors were prospectively monitored as part of this study. The largest source of impairment was psychiatric illness (45.3%), 77% of the doctors were male. The average age of the cohort was 41.6 (sd 11.1) years. Impaired doctors were more likely to be working in emergency medicine or psychiatry and be based in a rural area. Of those who had finished their involvement in the programme, successful graduates participated for a mean of 38.2 (sd 22.3) months. In general outcomes of involvement were positive, 64 of 113 (56.6%) of doctors successfully graduated from the programme. One hundred and ten of 168 (65.5%) improved during the period of their involvement and 111 of 126 (88.1%) were working in medicine. Five, 2.8% of the participants died during the period of this study. Measures of registrant insight and support tended to increase during the period of involvement with the Health Programme.  Future studies will need to establish evidence for the most appropriate interventions with impaired doctors. This process would be strengthened by the collection of standardized data across intervention programmes, supplemented with functional assessments and the collection of qualitative data.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Medical Board</field><field name="subject">Impaired Registrants Program</field><field name="subject">Health Program</field><field name="subject">Physicians</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Discipline</field><field name="subject">Substance use</field><field name="subject">Alcohol use</field><field name="subject">Drug use</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="subject">Medical care</field><field name="subject">Health and hygiene</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Medical policy</field><field name="subject">Doctors</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of Marine Protected Areas in Australia and in China</field><field name="creator">Liang, Qun, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Marine protected areas are recognized as an important approach to conserve marine ecosystems and biodiversity as well as to manage costal and marine resource.

Delay or Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is a relatively new field for routing, concerned with networks that experience long transmission delay or periods of disruption. Military forces around the globe have applied one or the other networking paradigms with varying degrees of success to their own problems of mobility at the lower tactical level (Brigade and below).	The fundamental reason for this limited success is that many of the desired tactical scenarios at this level require a network that is not exclusively ad hoc or exclusively disrupted, but rather a network that dynamically adapts to a variety of mobility situations ranging from relatively stable, almost enterprise like, to completely disrupted. Synchronous MANET protocols have limited disruption tolerance at layer 3, and DTN routing protocols, which are further up the network stack, implement hop by hop asynchronous protocols that are unable to take advantage of prolonged network stability. The primary contribution of this thesis is NOMAD, a new hybrid routing protocol for military mobile ad hoc and disrupted networks. NOMAD is unique in that it operates as a proactive synchronous link state MANET protocol when the network is connected, but is able to seamlessly transition into asynchronous DTN mode when required. The results outlined in this thesis indicate that the hybrid NOMAD protocol provides a substantial improvement over standard synchronous MANET protocols. This thesis also makes a significant contribution with respect to synthetic mobility model generation. Mobility models are essential for the correct evaluation of any routing protocol. A mobility modelling tool called SWarMM (Synthetic Warfare Mobility Modelling) was also developed as part of this thesis. SWarMM provides an agent based simulation tool for generating credible synthetic mobility models for use with the discrete network simulation tools, such as OPNET and NS2.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Networking</field><field name="subject">MANET</field><field name="subject">DTN</field><field name="subject">Routing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43724</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimal hedging strategy in stock index future markets</field><field name="creator">Xu, Weijun, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis we search for optimal hedging strategy in stock index futures markets by providing a comprehensive comparison of variety types of models in the related literature. We concentrate on the strategy that minimizes portfolio risk, i.e., minimum variance hedge ratio (MVHR) estimated from a range of time series models with different assumptions of market volatility. There are linear regression models assuming time-invariant volatility; GARCH-type models capturing time-varying volatility, Markov regime switching (MRS) regression models assuming state-varying volatility, and MRS-GARCH models capturing both time-varying and state-varying volatility. We use both Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Bayesian Gibbs-Sampling approach to estimate the models with four commonly used index futures contracts: S&amp;P 500, FTSE 100, Nikkei 225 and Hang Seng index futures. We apply risk reduction and utility maximization criterions to evaluate hedging performance of MVHRs estimated from these models. The in-sample results show that the optimal hedging strategy for the S&amp;P 500 and the Hang Seng index futures contracts is the MVHR estimated using the MRS-OLS model, while the optimal hedging strategy for the Nikkei 225 and the FTSE 100 futures contracts is the MVHR estimated using the Asymmetric-Diagonal-BEKK-GARCH and the Asymmetric-DCC-GARCH model, respectively. As in the out-of sample investigation, the time-varying models such as the BEKK-GARCH models especially the Scalar-BEKK model outperform those state-varying MRS models in majority of futures contracts in both one-step- and multiple-step-ahead  forecast cases. Overall the evidence suggests that there is no single model that can consistently produce the best strategy across different index futures contracts. Moreover, using more sophisticated models such as MRS-GARCH models provide some benefits compared with their corresponding single-state GARCH models in the in-sample case but not in the out-of-sample case. While comparing with other types of models MRS-GARCH models do not necessarily improve hedging efficiency. Furthermore, there is evidence that using Bayesian Gibbs-sampling approach to estimate the MRS models provides investors more efficient hedging strategy compared with the MLE method.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stock index.</field><field name="subject">Minimum Variance Hedge Ratio (MVHR)</field><field name="subject">Time-varying and state-varying volatility.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43728</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Membrane cleaning and ageing effect by chemical and enzymatic agents</field><field name="creator">Puspitasari, Vera Liany, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">MBR suppliers are largely recommending NaOCl as the cleaning agent. Despite the popularity of this chemical for membrane cleaning, there is a lack of publications regarding NaOCl optimum cleaning conditions. To properly conduct this optimization study (i.e. obtain the required level of reproducibility and confidence), a rigorous methodology is still required. The potential effect of NaOCl on polymeric materials ageing has drawn attention and recent studies have been dedicated to assess the impact of its exposure on numerous membrane materials (except polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)).  PVDF and polypropylene (PP) hollow fibers were investigated using unwashed yeast as model fouling solution, while mixture of sodium alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA) acted as feed solution for PVDF flat sheet. The cleaning efficiency and optimum NaOCl concentration were found to vary between the different membrane materials and between single and cyclical cleanings. During cyclical cleaning, foulant was more difficult to remove. When 2% NaOCl was used, Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy showed a change in membrane function groups on PVDF flat sheet, indicating ageing occurrence.  NaOCl agemg caused changes in membrane properties. PP hollow fibers became more brittle with 60 % elongation decrease after 13 weeks. PVDF flat sheet membrane exhibited two-steps-degradation mechanism; firstly, the removal of its surface modification substance, and secondly, the increase of its hydrophilicity. These results were confirmed by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), FTIR Spectroscopy, contact angle and hydraulic measurement.  Enzyme is an alternative option for membrane cleaning. However, the enzymatic cleaning study did not present encouraging results. Optimum cleaning efficiency for protease (68%) and amylase (73%) were found to be lower compared to NaOCl cleaning (95%). Lowry and Dubois methods found that residual foulants were present on the membrane after the cleaning process, which caused fouling to occur faster when membrane was re-used.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Enzyme.</field><field name="subject">NaOC1</field><field name="subject">Membrane cleaning.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43731</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of cation addition on cellular response and bone ingrowth into three dimensional porous bioceramics</field><field name="creator">Deng, Honghua, Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The success of orthopaedic implants fixed in the skeletal system using bone ingrowth into porous surfaces is critically dependent on the extent and quality of the initial bone ingrowth and the subsequent long-term maintenance of the bone within the porous structure. Biologically-significant elements (Ca, Mg, Mn) were incorporated at concentrations up to 5 mol% in solid solution in yttia-stabilised tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3YTZP), whilst controlling microstructure and phase composition, to investigate the effect of ceramic chemistry on cellular behaviour in vitro and bone ingrowth into porous structures in vivo. Cellular attachment, proliferation, and migration on the ceramics were investigated using in vitro assays using fibroblasts. Cells were able to adhere strongly and proliferate on all ceramic surfaces, exhibiting maximal proliferation and minimal migration on 3YTZP but significantly faster migration on doped-3YTZP. The TZP ceramics were therefore considered to support normal cellular processes and thus were suitable for further study in vivo. A technique based on pressure casting ceramic slurry into a polymer preform of the desire pore structure, followed by polymer burnout and then sintering, was developed for fabricating porous bioceramics containing highly-controlled three-dimensional pore geometries. The ability of a selected pore structure to support bone ingrowth was tested using hydroxyapatite by implanting samples into femoral cortical bone of adult sheep for 4 and 12 weeks. Bone was able to rapidly colonise the porous structure and remodel such that, by 12 weeks implantation time, the majority of the porosity was filled with mature lamellar bone. Porous scaffolds of pure 3YTZP and 3YTZP doped with 1 mol% Mg, 1 mol% Mn, 1 mol% Ca, or 5 mol% Ca were fabricated and tested in the sheep model. Bone ingrowth into the doped compositions was significantly greater than that into pure 3YTZP, and was similar to that into the porous hydroxyapatite, indicating that the dopants significantly promoted osteogenesis within the bioinert scaffolds. This finding has application in clinical applications in that the initial bone ingrowth and, potentially, the long-term maintenance of bone within the porous structure may be improved by the incorporation of small amounts of biologically significant elements.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Doping</field><field name="subject">Bone ingrowth</field><field name="subject">Porous ceramic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43733</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural network based adaptive control for autonomous flight of fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicles</field><field name="creator">Puttige, Vishwas Ramadas, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents the development of small, inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)  to achieve autonomous  fight. Fixed wing hobby model planes are modified and instrumented  to form experimental platforms. Different sensors employed to collect the  flight  data are discussed along with their calibrations. The time constant and delay for the  servo-actuators for the platform are estimated. Two different data collection and processing  units based on micro-controller and PC104 architectures are developed and discussed.  These units are also used to program the identification and control algorithms.  Flight control of fixed wing UAVs is a challenging task due to the coupled, time-varying,  nonlinear dynamic behaviour. One of the possible alternatives for the flight control system  is to use the intelligent adaptive control techniques that provide online learning capability  to cope with varying dynamics and disturbances. Neural network based indirect adaptive  control strategy is applied for the current work. The two main components of the adaptive  control technique are the identification block and the control block. Identification  provides a mathematical model for the controller to adapt to varying dynamics. Neural  network based identification provides a black-box identification technique wherein a  suitable network provides prediction capability based upon the past inputs and outputs.  Auto-regressive neural networks are employed for this to ensure good retention capabilities  for the model that uses the past outputs and inputs along with the present inputs. Online  and offline identification of UAV platforms are discussed based upon the  flight data.  Suitable modifications to the Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm for online training  are proposed. The effect of varying the different network parameters on the performance  of the network are numerically tested out. A new performance index is proposed that is  shown to improve the accuracy of prediction and also reduces the training time for these  networks. The identification algorithms are validated both numerically and  flight tested.  A hardware-in-loop simulation system has been developed to test the identification and  control algorithms before  flight testing to identify the problems in real time implementation  on the UAVs. This is developed to keep the validation process simple and a graphical  user interface is provided to visualise the UAV  flight during simulations.  A dual neural network controller is proposed as the adaptive controller based upon the  identification models. This has two neural networks collated together. One of the neural  networks is trained online to adapt to changes in the dynamics. Two feedback loops are  provided as part of the overall structure that is seen to improve the accuracy. Proofs  for stability analysis in the form of convergence of the identifier and controller networks  based on Lyapunov's technique are presented. In this analysis suitable bounds on the  rate of learning for the networks are imposed. Numerical results are presented to validate  the adaptive controller for single-input single-output as well as multi-input multi-output  subsystems of the UAV. Real time validation results and various  flight test results confirm  the feasibility of the proposed adaptive technique as a reliable tool to achieve autonomous  flight. The comparison of the proposed technique with a baseline gain scheduled controller  both in numerical simulations as well as test  flights bring out the salient adaptive feature  of the proposed technique to the time-varying, nonlinear dynamics of the UAV platforms  under different  flying conditions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Drone aircraft : control systems</field><field name="subject">Adaptive control systems :  testing</field><field name="subject">Unmanned aerial vehicles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43736</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effect of synthetic jet driving parameters on heat transfer in microchips cooling channels</field><field name="creator">Li, Dan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the growing power dissipation and more densely packed circuits, the issue of efficient thermal management has become crucial. The safe and reliable operations of microchips have a requirement on a junction temperature below 85??C. In order to meet the heat dissipation requirement at the level of 1 MW m???? of the next generation microchips, a new cooling approach has been proposed by combining the merits from forced convection in the microchannel and the synthetic jet impingements.  A parametric study has been carried out on the operating conditions on the synthetic jet actuator, these parameters including: the frequency of the diaphragm in the actuator, the jet outlet velocity both in magnitude and the wave shape as well as the pressure difference between the channel two ends. It was found that these parameters have combined effect on the flow structure as well as the heat transfer rate in the microchannel.  When the average jet velocity was at 2.36 ms??&#185;(Rej= 130), with a fixed pressure difference at 750 Pa, the maximum temperature in the silicon wafer has been reduced to about 343 K at both 560 and 1120 Hz, which was 2 K lower than when 280 Hz was used. However when the average jet velocity was increased by 50 %, the optimal heat transfer then occurred at 1120 Hz, the maximum temperature was reduced to 337 K, with 4 K and 5K difference of 280 and 560 Hz, respectively. Furthermore when the average jet velocity was doubled from Rej= 130, the frequency at 280 Hz achieved the lowest maximum temperature in the wafer at 336 K that was 5 K and 3 K lower than 560 Hz and 1120 Hz.  The flow temperature in the actuator is an important factor which affects the heat transfer in the microchannel. In order to lower the cavity temperature and avoid the ingestion of the already mixed flow, the time portion of the ingestion and ejection phases has been altered, by reducing the ejection time and increasing the ingestion time. However this approach did not show any significant effect in the heat transfer process or decreasing the flow temperature in the cavity. However in a later study by increasing the pressure difference across the channel, the flow temperature in the cavity has been substantially reduced and the heat transfer in the channel changed significantly according to the flow structure. It was found that the high pressure in the channel could deliver the vortical structure to the hotter part of the wafer thus decreasing the maximum temperature in the silicon effectively, especially when high jet velocity was used.  When high jet velocity has been used, irregular variation of the flow was found The unrepeatable feature of the flow is related to the frequency, jet velocity as well as the channel pressure difference.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">High jet velocity.</field><field name="subject">Microchips.</field><field name="subject">Microchannels.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43737</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Repositioning human resource management in a global airline : the struggle for legitimacy.</field><field name="creator">Wilcox, Tracy Patricia, Organisation &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents a study of intra-organisational legitimation of the Human Resource function in a large Australian airline. Major changes in senior management and strategy, under tumultuous circumstances for the industry and the firm, saw a repositioning of human resources in the organisation. The study draws on empirical ethnographic research conducted within a large global airline over approximately fourteen months, focusing on 2001. Using a longitudinal and processual research strategy, the study adopted enabled the close examination of the interrelationships between institutional structures and organisational action, embedded in an organisational setting.  In particular, it considers the loss of legitimacy and agency of managers in a corporate human resources department and their response in re-establishing legitimacy in a new institutional context. Legitimacy implies the actions and existence of these actors and their sub-unit are both valued and considered valid by their constituencies.  In the analysis of the unfolding multi-layered processes of legitimation, I employed elements of neo-institutional theory and critical realist ontology and applied this analysis to a modified conception of structuration, mapping out the HR managers' experience of the inner context and how it came to position their practices and constrain their agency.  The study found that the human resource actors in the airline were able to re-form and regain the legitimacy of their sub-unit and of their major strategic initiative, by drawing on their stock of political relationships and on the plurality of logics, values and norms available within the large, diverse firm" Their reflexive awareness of their contextual positioning enabled them to alter their legitimation strategies and regain legitimacy"  This thesis makes a contribution to our understanding of processes of deinstitutionalisation and legitimation and ongoing structuration in organisational settings. It also expands our conceptualisation of legitimacy, by focusing on legitimation as an act of becoming, and developing the notion of legitimacy struggles as institutional politics. Finally, the thesis contributes to critical human resource management research and our understanding of human resource managers' capacity for agency within broader institutional contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Legitimacy.</field><field name="subject">Human resource management.</field><field name="subject">Global airline.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44514</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamine: contents and analyses in selected foods; effect of vitamin C supplementation on N-nitrosodimethylamine formation in humans; and an investigation of natural alternatives to nitrites as preservatives in cured meat products</field><field name="creator">Hsu, James Chun Hou, Chemical Sciences &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Dietary nitrite intake has been implicated in numerous gastrointestinal cancers in humans due to the formation of a group of carcinogens called N-nitroso compounds. The need to estimate their intake is vital in establishing at risk population and to monitor and perhaps one day manage their dietary intake. This is the first study to estimate nitrate and nitrite in selected vegetables, cured and fresh meat in Australian food supply using ion-paired reversed-phased HPLC. Nitrite content in meat products analysed ranged from 0 to 83.9 mg/kg in medallion beef and Frankfurt, respectively; nitrate content ranged from 18.7 mg/kg in minced beef to 142.5 mg/kg in salami. The nitrite content was below the maximum limit set by the Food Standards Australia and New Zealand. Nitrate content in selected vegetables ranged from 123 to 4850 mg/kg in Iceberg lettuce and English spinach, respectively; only minimal nitrite at 20 mg/kg was present in Gai choy, which was most likely due to bacterial contamination during storage. Based on the food consumption pattern of Australians, the dietary nitrite and nitrate intake from bacon were 1.51 and 3.42 mg per capita per day, which was below the Adequate Daily Intake set by the European Union Scientific Committee for food in 1995. Taking into considerations of oral nitrate reduction to nitrite and the endogenous nitrate formation, the upper extreme of dietary nitrite and nitrate intake in Australians were 44 and 2.4 times over the ADI, respectively. However, this does not take into effect of other dietary promoters and inhibitors. Eighteen healthy human volunteers were put on a low nitrate, nitrite and antioxidant diet for three days during which they were fed one serving of cured meat with and without 500 mg of vitamin C. Using GC-MS, N-nitrosodimethylamine was not detected in the urine before or after vitamin C supplementation, suggested that a diet low on nitrate and nitrite cannot produce NDMA and thus may reduce the risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers. Different extraction methods and combination of herbs and spices were demonstrated in vitro to show inhibition against B. cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus. In addition, autoclaved turmeric powder at 0.3 % (w/v), hot water extracted turmeric with ginger at 0.5 % and rosemary at 1.0 % showed growth inhibition against Clostridium sporogenes, which was used as a surrogate for Clostridium botulinum. The use of these combinations of herbs and spices may replace or at least reduce the use of nitrite as a preservative in cured meat products to prevent botulism and reduce dietary nitrite intake.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">N-nitrosodimethylamine</field><field name="subject">Nitrate</field><field name="subject">Nitrite</field><field name="subject">N-nitroso compounds</field><field name="subject">Nitrosation inhibitors</field><field name="subject">Botulism</field><field name="subject">Natural preservatives</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43740</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Planning for sustainable water and sanitation projects in rural, developing communities</field><field name="creator">Barnes, Rebecca Ruth, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Premature failure or abandonment of water or sanitation interventions in developing communities is a common phenomenon and one which is preventing potential benefits from being fully realised. While the causes of project failure are complex and varied, the literature addressing project failure implicates poor planning in many unsustained small-scale projects. In particular, a number of authors criticise planning that fails to include consideration of key sustainability areas.  This thesis explores the relationship between planning for rural water and sanitation development projects and their sustainability using both ??depth?? of information gathered through a case study in rural Philippines and ??breadth?? of information gathered from key informants representing a range of regions and organisational types. Key informant interviews show the case study findings to be generally transferable between regions. Both methods illustrate the need for interpersonal relationships of trust and unity, commitment and integrity in project personnel, significant time spent in data-gathering and consensus development, creative modes of communication, ongoing contact and detailed long-term financial planning.  A critical evaluation of 17 prominent, existing planning frameworks for rural water supply and sanitation projects is presented with respect to key attributes of good planning practice as identified during the case study and interviews. The evaluation reveals both strengths and inadequacies in current planning frameworks, illuminating possible causes of persistent poor planning. Finally, methods are identified by which planning processes can be improved so as to reduce the incidence of early water and sanitation project failure. An existing decision framework, the Water Services Association of Australia (WSAA) Sustainability Framework, was trialled during the Philippines Case Study. The new Planning Framework for Rural Water and Sanitation was developed as a result of the trial, the case study and the interviews. The new framework employs the primary sustainability criteria in the decision process in the form of constraints developed using participatory processes, thereby defining a safe space within which the beneficiaries may have freedom and confidence to select their desired technical solutions. Other key elements of good planning practice are incorporated, including those typically omitted by existing frameworks in the rural water and sanitation development sector.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Developing countries</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Sanitation</field><field name="subject">Sustainability</field><field name="subject">Planning</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44507</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on the dynamic relationship between different types of investment flow and prices</field><field name="creator">OH, Natalie Yoon-na, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents three related essays on the dynamic relationship between different types of investment flow and prices in the equity market. These studies attempt to provide greater insight into the evolution of prices by investigating not ???what moves prices??? but ???who moves prices??? by utilising a unique database from the Korean Stock Exchange.  The first essay investigates the trading behaviour and performance of online equity investors in comparison to other investors on the Korean stock market. Whilst the usage of online resources for trading is becoming more and more prevalent in financial markets, the literature on the role of online investors and their impact on prices is limited. The main finding arising from this essay supports the claim that online investors are noise traders at an aggregate level. Whereas foreigners show distinct trading patterns as a group in terms of consensus on the direction of market movements, online investors do not show such distinct trading patterns. The essay concludes that online investors do not trade on clear information signals and introduce noise into the market. Direct performance and market timing ability measures further show that online investors are the worst performers and market timers whereas foreign investors consistently show outstanding performance and market timing ability.  Domestic mutual funds in Korea have not been extensively researched. The second essay analyses mutual fund activity and relations between stock market returns and mutual fund flows in Korea. Although regulatory authorities have been cautious about introducing competing funds, contractual-type mutual funds have not been cannibalized by the US-style corporate mutual funds that started trading in 1998. Negative feedback trading activity is observed between stock market returns and mutual fund flows, measured as net trading volumes using stock purchases and sales volume. It is predominantly returns that drive flows, although stock purchases contain information about returns, partially supporting the price pressure hypothesis. After controlling for declining markets, the results suggest Korean equity fund managers tend to swing indiscriminately between increasing purchases and increasing sales in times of rising market volatility, possibly viewing volatility as an opportunity to profit and defying the mean-variance framework that predicts investors should retract from the market as volatility increases. Mutual funds respond indifferently to wide dispersions in investor beliefs.  The third essay focuses on the conflicting issue of home bias by looking at the impact on domestic prices of foreign trades relative to locals using high frequency data from the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE). This essay extends the work of Choe, Kho and Stulz (2004) (CKS) in three ways. First, it analyses the post-Asian financial crisis period, whereas CKS (2004) analyse the crisis (1996-98) period. Second, this essay adopts a modified version of the CKS method to better capture the aggregate behaviour of each investor-type by utilising the participation ratio in comparison to the CKS method. Third, this essay does not limit investigation to intra-day analysis but extends to daily analysis up to 50 days to observe the effect of intensive trading activity in a longer horizon than the CKS study. In contrast to the CKS findings, this paper finds that foreigners have a short-lived private information advantage over locals and trades by foreigners have a larger impact on prices using intra-day data. However, assuming investors buy-hold for up to 50 days, the local individuals provide a greater impact and more profitable returns than foreigners. Superior performance is documented for buys rather than sells.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">investor types</field><field name="subject">price discovery</field><field name="subject">volume and price relationship</field><field name="subject">Stocks</field><field name="subject">Prices</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="subject">South</field><field name="subject">Investments</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cavability assessment in longwall top coal caving technology</field><field name="creator">Vakili Mirzamani, Seyed Abouzar, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) technology has great potential for more efficient mining of Australian thick coal seams. LTCC can potentially double (or greater) the longwall recoverable tonnes, per metre of gateroad development and improve the safety standards in longwall operation.  Accurate cavability assessment of the coal seam is the key pre-requisite for successful application of LTCC method. Although some cavability criteria were developed in previous studies, their shortcomings limit their application. Apart from the lack of suitable cavability criterion, the caving principles and mechanisms in longwall operation (and LTCC) is still not well understood.  The main objectives of this research work were: 1. to improve the general understanding about the caving mechanisms involved in LTCC operation, 2. to develop a new cavability assessment criterion, and 3. to characterise and classify the caving behaviour in selected Australian longwall operations.  For this study a combination of analytical, observational and empirical engineering methods were used to reduce the shortcoming of individual design methods. For analytical study, the Distinct Element Method (DEM) was selected for computational analysis as the most suitable technique for this type of study. For observational methods, the size distribution of particles in goaf was used as a monitoring measure for caving performance evaluation and this method was performed in three Australian longwall operations (Ulan, West Wallsend and Broadmeadow). The Empirical assessment was performed by using the results of observational/computational analyses along with basic geological/geotechnical data from selected mine sites to back analyse and re-evaluate the results.  The most significant outcomes of this study include: 1. a new cavability assessment system (Top Coal Cavability Rating, TCCR) that was developed based on computational analysis and by back analysis of past LTCC experience in China, 2. Improved understanding of caving mechanism, deformation mechanism and drawing mechanism of top coal in LTCC method, 3. advanced numerical models (UDEC, 3DEC and PFC models) that not only can be used for future research but can also be employed for LTCC design purposes, 4. characterisation and classification of caving behaviour in three Australian longwall operations.  The results of this study can be effectively used by Australian coal industry in feasibility and design studies of LTCC operation. The new cavability criterion can be used to identify and quantify the major risks that may be involved in LTCC application.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Numerical modelling.</field><field name="subject">Longwall top coal caving.</field><field name="subject">LTCC.</field><field name="subject">Cavability assessment.</field><field name="subject">Top coal cavability rating.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43743</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sydney apartments: the urban, cultural and design identity of the alternative dwelling 1900-2008</field><field name="creator">Butler-Bowdon, Caroline, School of Planning and Urban Development, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the significance of apartments in Sydney's urban history has not been recognised due to a cultural resistance to apartment living. This lack of acknowledgement has masked the urban, social and architectural impact of the apartment building type in Sydney's history. As an interdisciplinary reading of the development of the purpose-built apartment building in Sydney since its inception in 1900, the thesis is premised on a desire to use the apartment building as a vehicle to tell an alternative housing history to the more commonly told one of house and garden. In the process, it provides a different story of the city's development through the lens of the apartment building and challenges cultural prejudices against apartment living. The research documents the growth and changes of apartments, tracking their location, diversity of type and scale across the Sydney metropolitan region. The research analyses prototypical and generic apartment buildings in the context of the city's history. Drawing on the intersection of eras and themes as a method of critical inquiry, the thesis covers aspects of domestic debates, market, regulation, scale, demography, geography distribution, design and typology, traversing a time period of 1900 to 2008. The thesis explores the debates for and against apartment living in Sydney, emphasising the roles played by apartments in the broader discourses of Australian cultural and design history. The thesis concludes that after more than a century, the debates between apartment and cottage living continue to rage. In systematically providing a trajectory for the history of apartments from ideology to typology, this thesis establishes a place for apartments in Sydney's urban and cultural history; and simultaneously provides a deeper historical context to assist the process of better understanding and responding to the contemporary debate about high-density living and its consequences for the life of the city. Despite the size of its largely undocumented subject, this thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of its rationale: to use analysis of a specific, controversial building type to provide new insights into Sydney's urban history, ideologies and built forms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australain cultural and design history.</field><field name="subject">Sydney apartment buildings.</field><field name="subject">Urban history.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Composing women and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century in England, France and Germany</field><field name="creator">Harris, Amanda Jane, English, Media, &amp; Performing Arts, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The turn from the nineteenth century into the twentieth saw an increase in the number of composing European women attaining prominence in the music world. This period of history is also now recognised as one of the key phases of the first wave of feminism. Feminists and musical women moved in a similar stratum of society. Although women of this era have increasingly been the subject of scholarly research, music historians have rarely investigated the links between the turn of the century??s wave of composing women and feminists.  This dissertation uses the feminist and musical press as a means to investigate composing women??s engagement with feminism. I examine feminists?? regard for women musicians and conversely composing women??s views on feminism. The thesis also reframes the privatelives of composing women through an analysis of primary sources. The composers who form the focus of this biographical investigation include Lili Boulanger (1893-1918), Ethel Smyth (1858-1944), Luise Adolpha Le Beau (1850-1927), Louise H??ritte-Viardot (1841-1918) and Armande de Polignac (1876-1962). Using a large body of newly analysed, unpublished correspondence and private papers, this research offers fresh insights into the biographies of composing women as well as their own self-portrayal, revealing the complex nature of Ethel Smyth??s sexuality and reassessing the fatalistic portrait of Lili Boulanger which has been drawn in some previous studies. These biographical insights background the contentions of the thesis that composing women and feminists shared common ground.  Through investigating the presence of musicians in the feminist press and of feminism in the musical press, the thesis reveals an ambivalent relationship between feminists and musicians. The disappointed expectations of feminists are contrasted with the reasons composing women had for retaining a distance from feminism. The exploration of composing women??s political and personal context enables an understanding not only of their contribution to music history, but also of their place within the greater history of women??s development.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nineteenth century</field><field name="subject">Wwomen</field><field name="subject">Feminism</field><field name="subject">Twentieth century</field><field name="subject">Composers</field><field name="subject">England</field><field name="subject">France</field><field name="subject">Germany</field><field name="subject">Smyth</field><field name="subject">Boulanger</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43745</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expertise reversal effect in explanatory notes for readers of Shakespearean text</field><field name="creator">Oksa, Annishka, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent decades, research into human cognition has unveiled in-depth insights into the structures and processes involved in the encoding, storage and retrieval of information. As human working memory is limited in both duration and capacity, cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1994; Sweller &amp; Chandler 1994; Chandler &amp; Sweller 1991; 1996) asserts that information should be designed in a way that does not mentally overload learners. However, instructional designs rarely take into account cognitive processes when structuring teaching materials. In fact, many traditional forms of instruction were devised prior to fundamental research into cognitive load effects. As a result, learners are often subjected to cognitive overload when required to engage in extraneous tasks that are not directly related to meaningful learning.  This is a particular problem for intrinsically complex Shakespearean works, renowned to be some of the most difficult texts students may ever encounter. Acknowledging that Shakespearean texts were written for performance, they are not always studied as such. Frequently, the texts are read around the class, whereby the focus is not dramatic but literary. Therefore, under the current system of study it is necessary to investigate instruction for reading comprehension of Shakespearean texts. Reading  Shakespeare's plays will often overwhelm working memory resources and cause comprehension problems due to the many interactive elements of information readers are required to process simultaneously. This is a significant issue as Shakespeare's works hold a great deal of literary, dramatic, and linguistic significance and their study forms a compulsory part of school curriculum and assessment that affects all students from English speaking nations.  By tradition conventional modes of instruction for Shakespearean texts require readers to consult disparate sources of information such as footnotes and endnotes that may contain either inadequate or unnecessary detail. Having to search for relevant information and mentally integrate separate sources of text results in a split attention effect and causes high levels of unnecessary cognitive load. As a result, Shakespeare's texts continue to be such a struggle for many students that some educational faculties have started to initiate the removal of Shakespeare from curriculum instead of developing more effective instructional methods for this domain.  This study applies cognitive load theory as a means of investigating the comprehension of Shakespeare by testing the effects of explanatory notes integrated line by line with original Shakespearean verse. Previous studies in cognitive load theory have indicated that restructuring material in accordance with cognitive principles can optimise learning. However, the majority of these studies have focused on technical areas.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shakespearean texts.</field><field name="subject">Human cognition.</field><field name="subject">Cognitive load theory.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43747</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economics and Theology of Salvation in Adam Smith and Hegel</field><field name="creator">Yang, Yong Sun, Business, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores relationships between economics and theology through the concept of salvation. Self-interested behaviour is often equated with sin in religious circles including Christian theology, while it is the foundation of modern economic theory. Must there be a deep gulf between theology and economics in this and other areas?  This is the question of the thesis. The aim of this thesis is to show that economics and theology are mutually intertwined, and that understanding these links contributes to a better understanding of salvation. By showing that self-interest is not only the main motive of economic behaviour but also the basis of theological faith, the thesis will investigate their mutual interrelationship.  It argues that economics has a theological dimension as theology is embedded in economic thought, and that theology has an economic aspect as faith is dependent on the self-interested consciousness similar to economics. Different theology leads to different economics. Theological investigation of human behaviour cannot avoid economic account of human self-conscious desire as a way of salvation.  The argument about salvation is developed in relation to the two major philosophers Adam Smith and G.W.F. Hegel. Smith???s self-interest is a natural instinct embedded in human nature, while Hegel???s self-consciousness is a rational ability to be realized. It will be argued that this bifurcation comes from the differences in their theological foundations regarding grace, original sin, eternality, transcendence, immanence, etc. The illumination of the theological foundations of the economic ideas of two main thinkers helps to enrich our understanding of the issues related to salvation such as: sympathy and recognition, poverty and the state, invisible hand and cunning of reason, evil and scarcity, and eschatology. This thesis concludes that human self-conscious desire is a way of salvation both in economics and theology as they are mutually interrelated in theologies of economics in Adam Smith and Hegel. This interdisciplinary thesis contributes to better understanding of human behaviour not only in the world of economics but also in the ethical and religious world.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adam Smith</field><field name="subject">Economics</field><field name="subject">Theology</field><field name="subject">Hegel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43748</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Students' self-beliefs, attitudes and behaviours in school friendship and acquaintance groups</field><field name="creator">Hanham, Jose Manu, Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The broad aim of this research was to investigate group work in schools with friends and acquaintances. More specifically, the study sought to identify motivational factors that may underlie students' attitudes and behaviours when working in these contexts. Independent and interdependent self-construal, and self-efficacy for group work, were identified as variables that may be important for working in friendship and acquaintance groups. The participants were Year 10 and Year 11 students from secondary schools in the metropolitan area of Sydney, Australia. Data collection was carried out in three phases, the first two were survey-based, and the third was a mixed-methods study. In phase 1, participants (N = 188) attended two Independent schools. The main data analyses comprised exploratory factor analysis and multiple regression analysis. In phase 2, the participants (N = 583) attended nine randomly selected public schools. Data analysis was carried out using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling. In phase 3, participants (N = 38), attended two randomly selected public schools. In this phase, survey, observational and interview data were collected and analysed. The observational analysis centred on how students in friendship and acquaintance groups interacted whilst working on a group problem-solving activity. The interviews focused on students' experiences in the group problem-solving activity and their general perceptions, beliefs, and feelings about group work with friends and acquaintances. Group performance in the problem-solving activity was measured. Two results seemed particularly important. First, was the suggestion that self-efficacy for being receptive to the ideas of others and- self-efficacy for group facilitation in the friendship context may "flow-on" to corresponding self-efficacy beliefs in the acquaintance context. Second, interdependent and independent self, and self-efficacy for group work, were identified as important variables with regard to students' attitudes and behaviours in friendship and acquaintance groups. From a theoretical perspective the focus in this research on self-beliefs represents a relatively new way of studying group work with friends and acquaintances. From a practical perspective, the findings from the research should provide direction for teachers when they make decisions about how to organize students into groups for the purposes of learning.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Secondary school students.</field><field name="subject">Friends and aquaintances.</field><field name="subject">Group problem-solving activity.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43752</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of legislation and other factors on the safety performance of Australian coal mines</field><field name="creator">Parkin, Raymond John, Mining Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The theme of the thesis is to investigate the current safety paradigm in the Australian coal mining industry and establish if the safety performance is improving. The number of fatalities, serious bodily injuries and high potential injuries is unsatisfactory according to community standards. People are still being killed and there is little evidence of a sustained improvement trend over the last decade. Lost time injuries have reduced dramatically, but are now plateauing and over the last few years along with high potential injuries and other safety indicators are trending upwards. This research has found that hundreds of serious injuries are not being reported which would have a significant effect on safety indicators in the Industry.  Fatigue and awareness issues as well as travel times to work are having a major impact on safety at work, which is particularly evident when employees are working 12-hour shifts. The rapid expansion of the mining industry has required the growing use of contractors, hence creating a more inexperienced workforce. Another significant finding is that there is a close association between the level of fatalities recorded and the growing use of contract labour in the industry.  This research has demonstrated that the current approach to prosecution is counter productive, as it inhibits thorough safety investigation and creates a defensive rather than a proactive safety culture. This approach has resulted in unwillingness by companies to examine the root causes of accidents and incidents for the fear of being prosecuted.  This research has shown there is a lack of trust between mining companies, the unions and the inspectorate. It has been stated that miners lives are at risk because of the shortage of Inspectors in Queensland and that the inspectorate was not meeting its compliance obligations.  There is a "disconnect" between what mining companies aspire to achieve at the corporate level with their safety management systems and what is achieved at the coal face.  The thesis has demonstrated that safety performance is deteriorating and in order to improve this situation recommendations have been made regarding prosecution, contractors, fatigue, safety and health management systems, hours of work, audits and remuneration for inspectors.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Miners.</field><field name="subject">Australian coal mining industry .</field><field name="subject">Safety paradigm.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43757</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of optimization methods to solve computationally expensive problems</field><field name="creator">Isaacs, Amitay, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are population based heuristic optimization methods  used to solve single and multi-objective optimization problems. They can simultaneously search multiple regions to find global optimum solutions. As EAs  do not require gradient information for the search, they can be applied to optimization  problems involving functions of real, integer, or discrete variables. One of the drawbacks of EAs is that they require evaluations of numerous candidate solutions for convergence.  Most real life engineering design optimization problems involve highly nonlinear  objective and constraint functions arising out of computationally expensive simulations. For such problems, the computation cost of optimization using EAs can become quite prohibitive. This has stimulated the research into improving  the efficiency of EAs reported herein.  In this thesis, two major improvements are suggested for EAs. The first  improvement is the use of spatial surrogate models to replace the expensive  simulations for the evaluation of candidate solutions, and other is a novel constraint  handling technique. These modifications to EAs are tested on a number of numerical benchmarks and engineering examples using a fixed number of evaluations and the results are compared with basic EA. addition, the spatial  surrogates are used in the truss design application.  A generic framework for using spatial surrogate modeling, is proposed. Multiple  types of surrogate models are used for better approximation performance and  a prediction accuracy based validation is used to ensure that the approximations  do not misguide the evolutionary search. Two EAs are proposed using spatial  surrogate models for evaluation and evolution. For numerical benchmarks, the  spatial surrogate assisted EAs obtain significantly better (even orders of magnitude  better) results than EA and on an average 5-20% improvements in the objective value are observed for engineering examples.  Most EAs use constraint handling schemes that prefer feasible solutions over infeasible solutions. In the proposed infeasibility driven evolutionary algorithm  (IDEA), a few infeasible solutions are maintained in the population to augment  the evolutionary search through the infeasible regions along with the feasible regions to accelerate convergence. The studies on single and multi-objective test  problems demonstrate the faster convergence of IDEA over EA. In addition, the  infeasible solutions in the population can be used for trade-off studies.  Finally, discrete structures optimization (DSO) algorithm is proposed for  sizing and topology optimization of trusses. In DSO, topology optimization and  sizing optimization are separated to speed up the search for the optimum design.  The optimum topology is identified using strain energy based material removal  procedure. The topology optimization process correctly identifies the optimum  topology for 2-D and 3-D trusses using less than 200 function evaluations. The sizing optimization is performed later to find the optimum cross-sectional areas  of structural elements. In surrogate assisted DSO (SDSO), spatial surrogates are  used to accelerate the sizing optimization. The truss designs obtained using SDSO  are very close (within 7% of the weight) to the best reported in the literature  using only a fraction of the function evaluations (less than 7%).</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Spatial surrogate models</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary algorithms</field><field name="subject">Optimization methods</field><field name="subject">Constraint handling schemes</field><field name="subject">Optimum topology</field><field name="subject">Computationally problems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43758</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Short term refractive and corneal topographic changes in hyperopic orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Gifford, Paul, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Although there is considerable published research on the efficacy and corneal response to orthokeratology (OK) lenses that flatten corneal curvature to correct myopia, the effects of OK lenses that attempt to steepen corneal curvature to correct hyperopia are poorly understood. This project investigated the effects of hyperopic OK lens wear on corneal shape, refraction and vision.  Open-eye and closed-eye overnight studies were conducted with proprietary hyperopic OK lenses, and these led to the development of an experimental hyperopic OK lens design which allowed manipulation of individual lens design parameters. Changes to refraction and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), corneal topography (Medmont E300), and the profile of total and stromal corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer) were measured over periods up to one week of overnight lens wear.  Most refractive change occurred after the first night of wear, with increasing effect towards one week. Retention of effect at the end of the day increased with more nights of lens wear. BCVA decreased with longer periods of lens wear. Greater inter-subject variability in effect was found with higher refractive targets.  The central cornea steepened and para-central cornea flattened producing a central steepening zone (CSZ) surrounded by a para-central annular flattened zone. CSZ diameter reduced with longer periods of lens wear, and this was significantly associated with decreases in high and low contrast BCVA.  There was no change in central corneal thickness beyond the normal overnight lens induced hypoxic edema response. Once edema had resolved thinning of the para-central corneal epithelium was found which resulted in an overall thinning of the para-central cornea.  Although central lens fenestrations did not affect the hyperopic OK response, a stronger relationship between changes to apical corneal curvature and refraction resulted. This supports the conclusion that the hyperopic OK effect is due to molding of the corneal surface towards alignment with the lens back surface. Similarities to the pattern of clinical change in myopic OK suggest that a similar corneal molding mechanism occurs in myopic OK. BCVA loss prevented longer term studies and needs to be resolved if hyperopic OK is to become established as a viable clinical technique.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lenses.</field><field name="subject">Cornea.</field><field name="subject">Hyperopic orthokeratology.</field><field name="subject">Refraction.</field><field name="subject">Vision.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43760</field></doc><doc><field name="title">States of unrest: photography and trauma</field><field name="creator">Peterson, Tanya, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">States of Unrest: Photography and Trauma is an interdisciplinary study of the dialectic between photography and trauma.

The study explores trauma??s mnemonic processes and symptoms and their structural similarities to photography??s modes of registration and representation. The framework of the study is developed through a close reading of three different manifestations of war-related images as a way of considering the language, circulation, and impact of traumatic images. It considers this field, firstly, in terms of the function of domestic photography produced during the time of World War II; secondly, in relation to photographic documentation of the Vietnam War; and thirdly, through imagery made in response to the ongoing war in Afghanistan. It examines the relationship between photography and trauma in terms of theories of absence and presence, ultimately arguing in favour of a model of understanding based on a surplus economy of meaning, as opposed to a framing of absence.

Those problems arise from the unavailability of suitable chromosomal representation and evaluation schemes of GA for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). The representation and evaluation schemes already in use have problems of high computational cost, illegal chromosomes (chromosomes not representing a legal tour) and wrong fitness assignment (fitness not truly representing chromosome genetic makeup). These problems are addressed by several proposed new schemes, namely the Self Imposed Constraints Evaluation scheme, the Contour and Reverse Contour Evaluation schemes and the Order Skipping Evaluation scheme, which are specifically tailored for various objectives, problems and situations. Apart from this, a methodology, which has previously being used in other meta-heuristics, is incorporated into GA i.e., the independent application of GA on various sub-localities of the problem. We call this GA, a Localized Genetic Algorithm (LGA). LGA is an iterative procedure between optimization and controlled de-optimization. The procedure of controlled de-optimization is also novel. It brings the solution into a new search space while controlling its cost effectively. LGA is introduced with various search techniques, i.e. intensive, extensive and selective, the use of which depends on the problem size and the availability of computational resources. Furthermore, search reduction techniques (Fitness Approximation Methods) are also introduced into the LGA, which has enabled the LGA to be applied to large scale problems. Due to the implementation of those proposals, LGA is the first GA-driven approach to be applied to very large scale CVRP problems of up to 1200 customers, i.e. datasets presented by Feiyue in 2005 and large scale VRPTW problems of up to 1000 customers, datasets presented by Gehring and Homberger in 1999. Lastly, a standard unit for computational comparison, i.e., Bellman's Evaluation Units BEUs, is also introduced to facilitate computational comparisons for future researchers. LGA has shown promising results on CVRP and VRPTW problems. It is flexible and also has the potential to be extended to not only other vehicle routing problems, but also to other ordering problems.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Localized genetic algorithm (LGA)</field><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm (GA)</field><field name="subject">Vehicle routing problem (VRP)</field><field name="subject">Controlled de-optimization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43763</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An integrated evolutionary system for solving optimization problems</field><field name="creator">Barkat Ullah, Abu Saleh Shah Muhammad, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many real-world decision processes require solving optimization problems which  may involve different types of constraints such as inequality and equality constraints.  The hurdles in solving these Constrained Optimization Problems (COPs) arise from the  challenge of searching a huge variable space in order to locate feasible points with  acceptable solution quality. Over the last decades Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have  brought a tremendous advancement in the area of computer science and optimization  with their ability to solve various problems. However, EAs have inherent difficulty in  dealing with constraints when solving COPs.  This thesis presents a new Agent-based Memetic Algorithm (AMA) for solving  COPs, where the agents have the ability to independently select a suitable Life Span  Learning Process (LSLP) from a set of LSLPs. Each agent represents a candidate  solution of the optimization problem and tries to improve its solution through cooperation  with other agents. Evolutionary operators consist of only crossover and one of  the self-adaptively selected LSLPs. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested  on benchmark problems, and the experimental results show convincing performance.  The quality of individuals in the initial population influences the performance of  evolutionary algorithms, especially when the feasible region of the constrained  optimization problems is very tiny in comparison to the entire search space. This thesis  proposes a method that improves the quality of randomly generated initial solutions by  sacrificing very little in diversity of the population. The proposed Search Space  Reduction Technique (SSRT) is tested using five different existing EAs, including  AMA, by solving a number of state-of-the-art test problems and a real world case  problem. The experimental results show SSRT improves the solution quality, and speeds  up the performance of the algorithms. The handling of equality constraints has long been a difficult issue for evolutionary optimization methods, although several methods are available in the literature for  handling functional constraints. In any optimization problems with equality constraints,  to satisfy the condition of feasibility and optimality the solution points must lie on each  and every equality constraint. This reduces the size of the feasible space and makes it  difficult for EAs to locate feasible and optimal solutions. A new Equality Constraint  Handling Technique (ECHT) is presented in this thesis, to enhance the performance of  AMA in solving constrained optimization problems with equality constraints. The basic  concept is to reach a point on the equality constraint from its current position by the  selected individual solution and then explore on the constraint landscape. The technique  is used as an agent learning process in AMA. The experimental results confirm the  improved performance of the proposed algorithm.  This thesis also proposes a Modified Genetic Algorithm (MGA) for solving COPs  with equality constraints. After achieving inspiring performance in AMA when dealing  with equality constraints, the new technique is used in the design of MGA. The  experimental results show that the proposed algorithm overcomes the limitations of GA  in solving COPs with equality constraints, and provides good quality solutions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Constrained Optimization Problems</field><field name="subject">Agent-based Evolutionary Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Agent-based Memetic Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Constraint Handling Technique</field><field name="subject">Evolutionary Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Genetic Algorithms</field><field name="subject">Multi-agent Systems</field><field name="subject">Memetic Algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43764</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evolutionary algorithms for solving job-shop scheduling problems in the presence of process interruptions</field><field name="creator">Hasan, S. M. Kamrul, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) is the problem of interest.  The classical JSSP is well-known as an NP-hard problem. Although with current  computational capabilities, the small problems are solvable using deterministic  methods, it is out of reach when they are larger in size. The complexity of JSSP is  further increased when process interruptions, such as machine breakdown and/or  machine unavailability, are introduced.  Over the last few decades, several stochastic algorithms have been proposed to  solve JSSPs. However, none of them are suitable for all kinds of problems. Genetic  and Memetic algorithms have proved their effectiveness in these regards, because  of their diverse searching behavior. In this thesis, we have developed one genetic  algorithm and three different Memetic Algorithms (MAs) for solving JSSPs. Three  priority rules are designed, namely partial re-ordering, gap reduction and restricted  swapping, and these have been used as local search techniques in designing our  MAs. We have solved 40 well-known benchmark problems and compared the results  obtained with some of the established algorithms available in the literature. Our  algorithm clearly outperforms those established algorithms. For better justification  of the superiority of MAs over GA, we have performed statistical significance testing  (Student's t-test). The experimental results show that MA, as compared to GA,  not only significantly improves the quality of solutions, but also reduces the overall  computation.  We have extended our work by proposing an improved local search technique, shifted  gap-reduction (SGR), which improves the performance of MAs when tested with  the relatively difficult test problems. We have also modified the new algorithm to accommodate JSSPs with machine unavailability and also developed a new reactive  scheduling technique to re-optimize the schedule after machine breakdowns. We  have considered two scenarios of machine unavailability. Firstly, where the unavailability  information is available in advance (predictive), and secondly, where the  information is known after a real breakdown (reactive). We show that the revised  schedule is mostly able to recover if the interruptions occur during the early stages  of the schedules. We also confirm that the effect of a single continuous breakdown  has more impact compared to short multiple breakdowns, even if the total durations  of the breakdowns are the same.  Finally, for convenience of implementation, we have developed a decision support  system (DSS). In the DSS, we have built a graphical user interface (GUI) for user  friendly data inputs, model choices, and output generation. This DSS tool will help  users in solving JSSPs without understanding the complexity of the problem and  solution approaches, as well as will contribute in reducing the computational and  operational costs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Genetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">Decision support system</field><field name="subject">Job-shop scheduling problem</field><field name="subject">Machine breakdown</field><field name="subject">Machine unavailability</field><field name="subject">Memetic algorithm</field><field name="subject">Priority rules</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43768</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Device driver reuse via virtual machines</field><field name="creator">LeVasseur, Joshua Thomas, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Device drivers constitute a significant portion of an operating system's source code. The effort to develop a new driver set is a sobering hurdle to the pursuit of novel operating system ventures. A practical solution is to reuse drivers, but this can contradict design goals in a new operating system. We offer a new approach to device-driver reuse, with a focus on promoting novel operating-system construction, which insulates the new operating system from the invariants of the reused drivers, while also addressing development effort. Our solution runs the drivers along with their original operating systems inside virtual machines, with some minor reuse infrastructure added to the driver's operating system to interface with the rest of the system. This approach turns the drivers into de-privileged applications of the new operating system, which separates their architectures and reduces cross-influences, and improves system dependability.  Virtual machines help reuse drivers, but they also penalize performance. The known solution for improving virtual machine performance, para-virtualization, modifies the operating system to run on a hypervisor, which has an enormous cost: substantial development effort, and abandonment of many of virtualization's benefits such as modularity. These costs contradict our goals for driver reuse: to reduce development effort, and to easily reuse from a variety of operating systems. Thus we introduce a new approach to constructing virtual machines: pre-virtualization. Our solution combines the performance of para-virtualization with the modularity of traditional virtual machines. We still modify the operating system, but according to a set of principles called soft layering that preserves modularity, and via automation which reduces implementation costs. With pre-virtualization we can easily reuse device drivers.  We describe our driver-reuse approach applied to a real system: we run virtual machines on the L4Ka::Pistachio microkernel, with reused Linux drivers. We include an evaluation and demonstrate that we achieve throughput comparable to the native Linux drivers, but with moderately higher CPU and memory utilization. Additionally, we describe how to apply pre-virtualization to multiple hypervisor environments. We include an evaluation of pre-virtualization, and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance to para-virtualization for both the L4Ka::Pistachio and Xen hypervisors, with modularity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pre- and para-virtualization.</field><field name="subject">Operating system.</field><field name="subject">Virtual machines.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43773</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Interactions between behavioural ecology and relatedness of female bottlenose dolphins in East Shark Bay, Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Frere, Celine Henria, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Female mammals play a central role in determination of social structure and are thus central to understanding the overall fission-fusion grouping pattern characteristic of many delphinid societies. Focusing specifically on female-female relatedness and association patterns, I have analysed more than 17 years of group composition, behavioural data, and genetic information to investigate complex interactions between behavioural ecology and relatedness and to also examine the common social evolutionary theory, that variation in mammalian social systems is typically attributed to five main factors: inclusive fitness, predation pressure, sexual conflict and male harassment, inbreeding avoidance, and resource competition. Overall, I found that female bottlenose dolphin association patterns depend upon the interplay between matrilineal kinship, biparental relatedness and home range overlap, and that female bottlenose dolphins seem to adapt their social strategies to seasonal variation in levels of predation and male harassment. The presence of both high sexual conflict and bisexual philopatry lead me to investigate the extent of inbreeding avoidance. I found that more than 14% of the calves were most likely the product of mating between close relatives, and identified female fitness costs to inbreeding. We were able to show that the effect of inbreeding on females??? fitness occurs via two independent mechanisms: being inbred and having at least one inbred calf. Inbred calves are on average weaned later than non-inbred calves, and a female???s first calf has a higher probability to be an inbred than subsequent calves. Last, I examined whether sociality provides inclusive fitness to female bottlenose dolphins through an investigation of both the additive genetic and social variance components of female calving success using a pedigree-free animal model. I found that variance in calving success of female bottlenose dolphins is best explained by complex genetic and social interactions. Females with high calving success showed both high genetic and social merit; they not only have good genes but also prefer to associate with others of high fitness. This study reveals that both social and heritable genetic variance contribute to fitness trait variance in the wild.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Kinship</field><field name="subject">Social evolution</field><field name="subject">Marine mammal</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43776</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electricity generation and distribution in Thailand: policy making, policy actors and conflict in the policy process</field><field name="creator">Rattanasak, Thanyawat, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Many analysts have attempted to develop a systematic approach towards understanding the public policy framework in Thailand, and the impact of policies on Thai society and the environment. However, approaches so far have been limited in scope, and little has been done to investigate Thailand's electricity development policy approach, and its impact on society and natural resources in Thailand. This thesis contributes to filling this knowledge gap through undertaking an analysis of the development of Thailand's electricity industry power generation policy, its institutions and the policy process. It also examines the policy actors working within the process, and their roles, power and influence, factors that have shaped the distinctive characteristics of the electricity industry in Thailand today, an industry that is being confronted by increased opposition to its development from a range of community groups concerned with adverse environmental and social impacts on it.  My research here uses Historical Institutionalism and Policy Network Analysis to guide the investigation. A qualitative research methodology, including the examination of documentary evidence and the interviewing of 25 key informants, was used to improve our knowledge of the policy process, and to reveal the nature of the conflicts that have emerged within the Thai policy-making bureaucracy, a bureaucracy that controls the electricity industry, and between these policy actors, the elected and military governments, and other parts of the Thai community.  My research found that the development of Thailand's electricity generation policy has been complex; influenced bysocio-economic and political factors, as well as by external factors such as conditionalities imposed by foreign governments and multinational lending agencies. These factors have constrained the political institutions and political elites who play a key role in setting the rules for the restructuring of the industry. As Thailand has developed to become more democratic, the emergence of new groups of policy-makers, such as elected-politicians and civil society, has brought about a change in electricity policy direction, and in the structure of the industry.  The research identified four key groups of policy actors participating in the Thai electricity policy arena, including first the 'old energy aristocrats'; officials in Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT) who established the industry. They were followed by the officials in Energy Policy and Planning Office (EPPO) who had a more commercial orientation and who challenged the earlier ideas, leading to proposals to privatize the industry. Civic Society Organisations (CSOs) emerged in the 1970s to challenge the large energy projects proposed by the Government, those supported by elected-politicians, particularly the politicians from Thai Rak Thai Party that tried to take control of the industry for their own ends. The TRT interventing in the industry after it came to power in the 1990s. Each of these policy participants developed their own discourses to influence policy-making and public opinion.  To reveal the nature of the challenges faced in developing the electricity industry in Thailand, this thesis focuses on a number of case studies of large electricity development projects, including the Nam Choan and Pak Mun Dam Projects, the Prachub Kirikhan Power Plant Projects, and the Wiang Haeng Coal Mine Development Project. My studies reveal evidence of the significant negative impacts that these projects had and continue to have, on the communities and environment adjacent to them, and on Thai society more generally. These problems emerged due to the fact that the policy institutions were, and still are, dominated by technocrats and political elites, with limited public participation in either the policy decisions made, or the policy development process. My thesis concludes that conflicts in relation to the electricity industry policy process are likely to grow in future years, and so makes a number of suggestions as to how these issues might be addressed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Electricity Generation Authority of Thailand (EGAT)</field><field name="subject">Thailand's electricity industry.</field><field name="subject">Electricity development policy.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43785</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Problems in nonlinear Bayesian filtering</field><field name="creator">Pasha, Syed, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents solutions to two open problems in estimation theory. The first is a tractable analytical solution for problems in multi-target filtering which are too complex to solve using traditional techniques. The second explores a new approach to the nonlinear filtering problem for a general class of models.  The approach to the multi-target filtering problem which involves jointly estimating a random process of the number of targets and their state, developed using the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter alleviates the intractability of the problem by avoiding explicit data association. Moreover, the notion of linear jump Markov systems is generalized to the multiple target case to accommodate births, deaths and switching dynamics to derive a closed form solution to the PHD recursion for this so-called linear Gaussian jump Markov multi-target model. The proposed solution is general enough to accommodate a broad class of practical problems which are deemed intractable using traditional techniques. Based on this closed form solution, an efficient method is developed for tracking multiple maneuvering targets that switch between multiple models without the need for gating, track initiation and termination, or clustering for extracting state estimates.  The approach to the nonlinear filtering problem explores the framework of the virtual linear fractional transformation (LFT) model which localizes the nonlinearity to the feedback with a simple and sparse structure. The LFT is an exact representation for any differentiable nonlinear mapping and therefore amenable to a general class of problems. An alternative analytical approximation method is presented which avoids linearization of the state space model. The uncorrelated structure of the feedback connection gives of the state space model. The uncorrelated structure of the feedback connection gives better second-order moment approximation of the nonlinearly mapped variables. By arranging the unscented transform in the feedback, the prediction and estimation steps are derived in closed form. The proposed filters for the discrete-time model and continuous-time dynamics with sampled-data measurements respectively are shown to be robust under highly nonlinear and uncertain conditions where standard analytical approximation based filters diverge. Moreover, the LFT based filters are efficient for online implementation. In addition, the LFT framework is applied to extend the closed form solution of the PHD recursion to the nonlinear jump Markov multi-target model.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD)</field><field name="subject">Multi-target filtering.</field><field name="subject">Nonlinear filtering.</field><field name="subject">Markov multi-target model.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43792</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From opera theatre to home theatre: (the making of) theatrical spaces and devices in the landscape</field><field name="creator">Rafferty, S.B., Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">From opera theatre to home theatre (the making of) theatrical spaces and devices in the landscape -- No abstract provided.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Projection.</field><field name="subject">Theatrical spaces.</field><field name="subject">Home theatre.</field><field name="subject">Standee.</field><field name="subject">Sunbleaching.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43793</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The late effects of therapy in an Australian cohort of childhood cancer survivors</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Carmen Louise, Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Australia, up to 80% of individuals diagnosed with childhood cancer are now expected to survive for more than five years after their initial diagnosis. However, survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of developing late sequelae as a consequence of therapies received during childhood. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of selected late sequelae in a cohort of Australian childhood cancer survivors and identify treatment and genetic factors that may modify the risk of late sequelae in survivors. Our study included 1150 individuals treated for childhood cancer at the Sydney Children??s Hospital between 1962 and 1999, who had remained in remission &gt;3 years and were confirmed to be alive. Rates of mortality and second cancers among survivors were compared against population rates to determine standardised mortality and incidence ratios. Survivors completed a questionnaire on the incidence of adverse health conditions and provided a buccal specimen. Real time PCR was used to detect polymorphisms in genes involved in drug detoxification and transport. Rates of mortality and secondary cancers were found to be 7.5-fold (95%CI 5.4-10.1) and 4.9-fold (95%CI 2.9-8.0) higher among survivors of childhood cancer relative to the general population, respectively, with the highest risks observed for those survivors previously treated for Hodgkin??s disease. Over 60% of survivors reported at least one cardiopulmonary, endocrine or sensory-motor condition following diagnosis of childhood cancer; the most frequently observed conditions included growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. Late sequelae were most frequently reported by females and survivors of brain tumours. Genetic investigations showed that an increased risk of growth hormone deficiency was associated with homozygosity for the GSTM1 null polymorphism, while no gene associations were observed to influence the risk of second cancers among survivors. Our study demonstrates that survivors of childhood cancer are at risk of developing a variety of health conditions as a result of anti-cancer therapies received during childhood. Determining risk factors for late sequelae based on therapy type, lifestyle and genetic predisposition will enable the optimisation of treatment protocols and promote the future well-being of childhood cancer survivors.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polymorphism</field><field name="subject">Cancer survivor</field><field name="subject">Childhood cancer</field><field name="subject">Late effects</field><field name="subject">Neoplasms</field><field name="subject">Second primary neoplasms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43794</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Consumer savvy: conceptualisation and measurement</field><field name="creator">Macdonald, Emma K., Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Against the backdrop of the interconnected global marketplace and the resulting decrease in consumer-firm information asymmetry, an increasingly prevalent assumption is that consumers are "empowered" and "savvy". However there are contrary findings that consumers are not empowered but feel "trapped", "victimised" and "manipulated" in interacting with firms. Additionally, while the notion of a growing base of increasingly competent consumers has captured the collective imagination, it is important with any social trend to consider variance that may occur due to individual characteristics. With the aim of establishing the truth-status of "consumer savvy" this study addresses the following questions: (1) What are the dimensions of consumer savvy? (2) Is savvy invariant across genders and age groups? (3) Does savvy affect consumers' approach to the consumer-firm interaction? (3a) Does it relate to desire for co-creation? (3b) Does it relate to perceptions of value in interacting with the firm? (3c) Does it increase the likelihood of consumer activism activities? (4) Are the effects of consumer savvy moderated by: (4a) the hedonic-utilitarian characteristics of products? or (4b) the technological innovativeness of products?  In addressing these questions, the initial emphasis is on establishing a conceptualisation of the characteristics of the savvy consumer. These characteristics are operationalised as a six dimensional "SAVVY" scale which becomes the focus of validation, assessment and application. The new scale's factorial (item-level) measurement equivalence is established for gender. However, measurement non-invariance is found for Gen X versus Baby Boomer consumers, hence caution is required when using it as a generational profiling tool. A vignette experiment to test the scale's predictive validity found that high-savvy consumers have significantly greater desire to engage in co-creation, are significantly more likely to perceive value in the interaction, and are significantly more likely to engage in word-of-web, but are not more likely to complain, than low-savvy consumers.  The findings have implications for researchers and practitioners interested in the potential for consumer-centric marketing approaches. The two key contributions are the development of a framework for conceptualising consumer savvy and the operationalisation and validation ofthe SAVVY scale as a tool for prediction and population profiling.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consumer savvy.</field><field name="subject">Consumer-firm interaction.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43795</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Land incorporated: moving through landscape</field><field name="creator">Haley, Rochelle Denise, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Land Incorporated is a practice-based investigation into the relation between the land, the body and its representation.

Given that older adults are particularly vulnerable to the negative consequences of loneliness and social isolation, it is surprising that few studies have assessed empathy in this group. The current programme of research addressed this gap in the literature by testing competing predictions derived from Socioemotional Selectivity Theory and the Ageing-Brain Model for age-related sparing and impairment of empathy, respectively. 	Study 1 compared young (N = 80) and older (N = 49) adults?? self-reported levels of cognitive and affective empathy, and engagement in social activities. It was found that although affective empathy is spared, cognitive empathy is subject to age-related decline, and this decline mediates reductions in social participation. These data therefore affirmed the importance of further investigation into the nature, causes and potential consequences of age-related differences in empathy. 	Since disinhibition is one mechanism contributing to difficulty taking the perspective of another, and is known to increase with age, in Study 2, behavioural measures sensitive to inhibitory failure and to cognitive empathy were  administered to young (N = 36) and older (N = 33) adults. One of the measures of cognitive empathy directly manipulated inhibitory demands, involving either high or low levels of self-perspective inhibition. The results indicated that older adults were selectively impaired on the high-inhibition condition, with cognitive disinhibition mediating this association. Study 2 therefore provided important evidence relating to one potential mechanism that contributes to age-related difficulties in perspective-taking. 	Studies 3 and 4 provided the first behavioural assessments of age-related differences in affective empathy by using electromyography to index facial expression mimicry. Study 3 found that young (N = 35) and older (N = 35) adults?? demonstrate comparable mimicry of anger, but older adults?? initial (i.e., implicit) reactions were associated with reduced anger recognition. Thus, to test the possibility that despite explicit recognition difficulties, implicit processing of facial expressions may be preserved in older adulthood, Study 4 compared young (N = 46) and older (N = 40) adults?? mimicry responses to subliminally presented angry and happy facial expressions. As predicted, the two groups demonstrated commensurate subconscious mimicry of these expressions. 	Taken together, these studies indicate that separate components of empathy are differentially affected by healthy adult ageing. Implications for competing perspectives of socioemotional functioning in older adulthood are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Social functioning</field><field name="subject">Ageing</field><field name="subject">Empathy</field><field name="subject">Executive control</field><field name="subject">Mimicry</field><field name="subject">EMG</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A graphic investigation of the atlas as a narrative format for the visual communication of cultural and social data</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Richard Cedric Thomas, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Maps and atlases are traditionally convenient documents for representing the surface of the earth. They provide an impression of spatial relationships and facilitate an appreciation of geographical and environmental characteristics. They are essential tools for creating an awareness of the world beyond the limits of our experience. Maps can also inform readers on the flow of cultural or economic influences, because they show localities in relation to their neighbours. Furthermore, they capture the reader's imagination by provoking the desire for adventure and exploration. Occasionally maps are also censored because they are an efficient means of indicating strategic features.  This project concerns the historical and contemporary examples of communicating information visually by analysing a selection of conventional literary and visual sources, which informs the research. It includes graphic forms that present abundant data, for example, atlases and texts on the architectural history of Central Asia, Tibet, China and Japan. The studio works will examine illustration, draughtsmanship, rendering, and textual/visual imagery.  The outcome will be an illustrated atlas of traditional architecture in the earthquake zones of Central Asia (Xinjiang), Tibet, China, Japan and related areas. The graphic format is used as a narrative for the communication of environmental, cultural and architectural data of the region. The atlas is also intended to present the subject in a holistic form in relation to environmental influences on the structures and materiality of buildings, and the broader field of history.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Communication.</field><field name="subject">Maps.</field><field name="subject">Atlases.</field><field name="subject">Narrative format.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43798</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The lion in Chinese space and social life</field><field name="creator">Young, Min-Chia, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a systematic examination from a historical point of view of the rich diversity of forms and images of the lion motif in Chinese space and social life. Drawing on textual, linguistic and archaeological sources, it addresses the fundamental problem inherent in the study of the lion motif in China, that is, why a foreign import was adopted, transformed and assimilated into an existing culture and how it was then widely rendered in various forms and images as though it had been an indigenous image all along. The examination begins with a search for the origins, names for and appearance of the real lion in China and a comparison of this with the images, roles and powers of the ideological lion in the Chinese mind. It proceeds through an investigation into the liking of the ruling class for lions as tomb guardian beasts in their search for a better afterlife. The thesis then focuses on the adoption of the lion motif by ordinary people as a means of approaching the divine and gaining recognition, in the process of which the image of a ferocious beast was gradually transformed into that of a rotund pet. The pet-like ??look?? of the lion came to be associated with various vernacular cultures of Southern China and assumed a unique style during Ming (1368??1644), when the form and image of the animal became a living concept with little emphasis on its physical appearance. In other words, what perpetuated the significant role of the lion in Chinese space and social life was its conceptual image, not its physical shape. Two case studies, one based in Kinmen and the other in Sydney, further demonstrate that the physical appearance of the lion motif has little effect on the power and mechanism of the mighty animal in the Chinese mind. What matters most, when placing the lion motif in front of an entry way, is the reiteration or reenactment of the conceptual image of the lion through symbols, rituals and ??traditional?? beliefs by which this particular animal motif has become an enduring legacy of Chinese communities around the world. The thesis, then, summarises the changes in the lion motif and its transformation from a physical object to a living concept free from image and form constraints as a gradual process of Chinese perception that integrated the real animal with the imagined animal, strange and unfamiliar phenomena, and the dominant and popular cultures. The context of this integration may have been significantly influenced by the bureaucratic metaphor of the ruling class. The lasting meaning and significance of the lion motif, however, is due to the vision and determination of ordinary people, who are as much prone to seeking a comfortable space and the promise of a better life as have been their rulers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mortuary art</field><field name="subject">Chinese lion</field><field name="subject">Social life</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43802</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing service disruption in moving networks</field><field name="creator">Hassan, Mohammed Baseem, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Deploying networks onboard mass transit vehicles, e.g., trains and buses, and connecting these moving networks to the Internet using cellular or satellite services is seen as a promising technology to meet the broadband demand in the transport sector.  This thesis examines the problem of service disruptions in such moving networks and proposes original solutions to manage these disruptions. Service disruption is caused by two main reasons. First, unavailability of wireless resources in the back-haul (e.g., cellular) network may prevent successful handoff of all passenger calls when the moving vehicle leaves the coverage of one radio tower and enters another. Second, the moving network may face frequent network disconnections when the vehicle travels through environments with severe radio coverage, e.g., tunnels. To address service disruption due to back-haul resource unavailability, an advance resource reservation frame work is proposed whereby the deterministic mobility of public transport is exploited to reserve bandwidth at target radio base-stations along the route of the vehicle. The viability of the proposed advance reservation framework is validated by (i) a predictability analysis of resource demand of moving networks using real passenger data, which show that it is possible to predict the demand at an upcoming location based on past data and the passenger count at the current location, and (ii) design of cellular extensions which show that advance reservation not only can be accommodated in existing cellular architectures with minimal modifications, it can also guarantee fast and scalable access to massive reservation data. To quantify the effect of temporary network disconnections on the probability of service disruption, new mathematical models have been developed and validated by computer simulation. Finally, a novel proactive admission control (PAC) approach is proposed to reduce service disruption by rejecting new call requests when the moving network is predicted to experience an imminent network disconnection. Using mathematical modelling, it has been demonstrated that PAC reduces service disruption probability exponentially as a function of the proactive decision time with only a linear increase in the new call blocking probability. Practicality of the PAC approach has been confirmed using empirical data from actual vehicular trips.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Managing service disruption.</field><field name="subject">Moving networks.</field><field name="subject">Temporary network disconnections.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The violin music acoustics from baroque to romantic.</field><field name="creator">McLennan , John Ewan, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">A Baroque violin was initially made. It was then incrementally converted to a Romantic (modern) setup by replacing the short neck with a longer, more slender neck and adding a longer ebony fingerboard, a heavier bassbar and soundpost. This increased the total mass from 386 to 440 g. Several different Baroque and modern configurations, with baroque and modern style bows, were used for acoustical measurements and playing tests with professional violinists.  Chladni patterns were similar in both versions and also when the bridge was placed below the soundholes. The Baroque version gave higher body mode frequencies than the Romantic. Placing the bridge below the soundholes lowered the frequency of the 800 Hz resonance to 600 Hz.  Saunders Loudness Tests showed a response that varied strongly over the body resonances. For the transition from Baroque to Romantic setup, hand bowing showed an increase of 1 dB and machine bowing about 5 dB.  The compliance of the body added to the air lowered the main air resonance by 5 Hz, equivalent to adding about 130 cc to the 2000 cc air volume.  The top plate stiffness measured at the bridge feet was about 10 kN/m higher at the treble foot than at the bass foot, for all locations of the soundpost outside the treble foot. The stiffness at the bass foot remained constant. This was reversed when the soundpost was placed between the two feet: the stiffness at the treble foot was then lower than at the bass foot.  The rocking and bounce frequencies of the bridge were lowered from 3000 and 6000 Hz respectively to about 2.5 and 3 kHz when fitted to the violin. Thinning the bridge waist lowered the rocking frequency. Recordings of performances on the violin were made for many combinations of physical state (baroque or romantic), type of string and bow, position of bridge, and others. Long-term average spectra for these recordings are compared here, and an online appendix includes these recordings in a way that allows them to be readily compared: www.phys.ul1sw.edu.au/music/people/mclennanappendix.html</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Romantic.</field><field name="subject">Violin.</field><field name="subject">Baroque.</field><field name="subject">Music.</field><field name="subject">Acoustics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Location privacy in automotive telematics</field><field name="creator">Iqbal, Muhammad Usman, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The convergence of transport, communication, computing and positioning technologies has enabled a smart car revolution. As a result, pricing of roads based on telematics technologies has gained significant attention. While there are promised benefits, systematic disclosure of precise location has the ability to impinge on privacy of a special kind, known as location privacy.  The aim of this thesis is to provide technical designs that enhance the location privacy of motorists without compromising the benefits of accurate pricing. However, this research looks beyond a solely technology-based solution, For example, the ethical implications of the use of GPS data in pricing models have not been fully understood. Likewise. minimal research exists to evaluate the technical vulnerabilities that could be exploited to avoid criminal or financial penalties. To design a privacy-aware system, it is important to understand the needs of the stakeholders, most importantly the motorists. Knowledge about the anticipated privacy preferences of motorists is important in order to make reasonable predictions about their future willingness to adopt these systems. There is limited research so far Otl user perceptions regarding specific payment options in the uptake of privacy-aware systems.  This thesis provides a critical privacy assessment of two mobility pricing systems, namely electronic tolls and mobility-priced insurance. As a result of this assessment. policy recommendations arc developed which could support a common approach in facilitating privacy-aware mobility-pricing strategies. This thesis also evaluates the existing and potential inferential threats and vulnerabilities to develop security and privacy recommendations for privacy-aware pricing designs for tolls and insurance. Utilising these policy recommendations and analysing user-perception with regards to the feasibility of sustaining privacy and willingness to pay for privacy, two privacy-aware mobility pricing designs have been presented which bridge the entire array of privacy interests and bring them together into a unified approach capable of sustaining legal protection as well as satisfying privacy requirements of motorists. It is maintained that it is only by social and technical analysis working in tandem that critical privacy issues in relation to location can be addressed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Privacy-aware systems.</field><field name="subject">Telematics.</field><field name="subject">Location privacy.</field><field name="subject">Tolls.</field><field name="subject">Mobility-priced insurance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Terrestrial and freshwater turtles of early cretaceous Australia</field><field name="creator">Smith, Elizabeth T, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An unusual turtle fauna from Lightning Ridge, New South Wales (Albian) reveals that Australian turtles had a more extensive Mesozoic history than previously indicated. Reevaluation of several primitive groups provides novel information on turtle evolution in the southern hemisphere. Seven turtle taxa are identified at Lightning Ridge. Two are Testudines indet. and two indeterminate chelid groups are evinced by isolated elements. Three new taxa are assigned to the new family Spoochelyidae in the superfamily Meiolanoidea. Spoochelys ormondea n. fam., gen. et sp., Sunflashemys bartondracketti n. gen. et sp. and Opalania baagiwayamba n. gen. et sp. are predominantly land-living turtles with high-domed shells and short manus and pes. The sister-group relationship with the Meiolaniidae, supported by a suite of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies, increases the stratigraphic range of the horned turtles by around ~ 50 my. Primitive structures in Spoochelys (postparietal, supratemporal and interpterygoid vacuity), occur with derived features that are variably developed across Triassic and Jurassic turtles. Phylogenetic analysis precariously resolves the meiolanoids as sister group to a clade containing Palaeochersis and Proterochersis. Limited pleurodiran attributes suggest that meiolanoids may be pleurodiromorphs, closer to primitive pleurodires than to cryptodires. As basal &#145;side-necked&#146; turtles, the Lightning Ridge meiolanoids permit first insights into cranial and postcranial progressions in pleurodiran stem taxa. Evidence of diverse meiolanoids in Early Cretaceous Australia and ancient radiations of meiolanoid-like turtles in southern Pangea, suggest that the horned turtles are a Triassic group and that the dichotomy between Pleurodira and Cryptodira occurred well before the Late Triassic. Early Cretaceous chelids at Lightning Ridge occur at higher palaeolatitude than in South America. The temporal range of Australian chelids is extended by ~ 50 my, demonstrating that chelids had a Jurassic history in Australia, with broad diversifications across the polar supercontinent. The palaeoecological setting of Lightning Ridge is comprehensively described for the first time. Diverse invertebrates and vertebrates include terrestrial, freshwater aquatic and rare marine forms that are anomalous at this near-polar palaeolatitude (~65-70oS). The anachronistic occurrence in Early Cretaceous Australia of distinctive radiations of &#145;Triassic-type&#146; turtles, and other relic groups, implies prolonged intervals of biogeographic isolation in the eastern provinces of Pangea.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Meiolanoidea</field><field name="subject">Early Cretaceous Australia</field><field name="subject">Lightning Ridge</field><field name="subject">Chelidae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43808</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The stakes involved in Emancipatory Acts</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Jamie Quasar, Social Sciences &amp; International Studies, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis develops a comprehensive account of human political ontology through the discussion of Plato, Rousseau, Lacan, Lyotard, Hugo, Conrad, Tolstoy and Nietzsche. At the heart of this account lies the dialectical struggle between an individual's need to belong and their fidelity to an intuitively recognisable, yet difficult to define good (or set of goods), that has, over the millennia, been conceptualised as, amongst other things, the form of the good, self interest, compassion, love, friendship, the event, conscience, reason and truth. Through the development of this account of human political ontology the thesis will elucidate the stakes involved in emancipatory acts, be they broad social movements or individual transformations. Its most important argument is that people almost always fail to recognise that to which they belong; the consequence of this being that they mistake the acts which function to reaffirm their belonging for acts that are indicative of their sovereign being. This phenomenon becomes particularly troubling once we recognise that the acts which function to reaffirm an individual??s belonging can depend upon the individual sacrificing both themself and others.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ontology</field><field name="subject">Emancipation</field><field name="subject">Protest</field><field name="subject">Ethics</field><field name="subject">Political philosophy</field><field name="subject">Hypocrisy</field><field name="subject">Social movements</field><field name="subject">Lyotard</field><field name="subject">Hugo</field><field name="subject">Progressive</field><field name="subject">Sacrifice</field><field name="subject">Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Literature</field><field name="subject">Tolstoy</field><field name="subject">Lacan</field><field name="subject">Conrad</field><field name="subject">Nietzsche</field><field name="subject">Dialectic</field><field name="subject">Truth</field><field name="subject">Love</field><field name="subject">Faith</field><field name="subject">Liberty</field><field name="subject">Jouissance</field><field name="subject">Other</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44523</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Experimental investigation and constitutive modelling of thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling in unsaturated soils.</field><field name="creator">Uchaipichat, Anuchit, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A thermo-elastic-plastic model for unsaturated soils has been presented based on the effective stress principle considering the thermo-mechanical and suction coupling effects. The thermo-elastic-plastic constitutive equations for stress-strain relations of the solid skeleton and changes in fluid content and entropy for unsaturated soils have been established. A plasticity model is derived from energy considerations. The model derived covers both associative and non-associative flow behaviours and the modified Cam-Clay is considered as a special case. All model coefficients are identified in terms of measurable parameters. To verify the proposed model, an experimental program has been developed. A series of controlled laboratory tests were carried out on a compacted silt sample using a triaxial equipment modified for testing unsaturated soils at elevated temperatures. Imageprocessing technique was used for measuring the volume change of the samples subjected to mechanical, thermal and hydric loading. It is shown that the effective critical state parameters M, ???? and ???? are independent of temperature and matric suction. Nevertheless, the shape of loading collapse (LC) curve was affected by temperature and suction. Furthermore, the temperature change affected the soil water characteristic curve and an increase in temperature caused a decrease in the air entry suction. The simulations from the proposed model are compared with the experimental results. The model calibration was performed to extract the model parameters from the experimental results. Good agreement between the results predicted using the proposed model and the experimental results was obtained in all cases.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil moisture</field><field name="subject">Mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Models</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Soil structure interaction</field><field name="subject">Soil heating</field><field name="subject">Soils</field><field name="subject">Thermal properties</field><field name="subject">unsaturated soils</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological effects of GSM mobile phone microwave radiation: an investigation of gene expression</field><field name="creator">Blood, Alan, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">There is evidence that athermal radiofrequency radiation can alter Heat Shock Protein (HSP) expression or protein phosphorylation, or alter MAP kinase signalling. Effects of long-term exposure in brain tissue due to repeated HSP perturbation (eg an inhibition of apoptosis) have been hypothesised (French et al, 2001). This study aimed to investigate the RNA expression profile (12,000 genes) and HSP family protein expression levels after either acute 1-hour or chronic 4-day intermittent exposures to simulated GSM radiation in a human primary fibroblast model. The results found minimal or no effects of GSM. Flasks were exposed to 900 MHz (217 Hz modulation) at 0.18 W/kg SAR within a Transverse Electromagnetic Mode chamber (TEM cell). Cultures rested for 2 hours before exposures. Affymetrix U95A microarray analysis of a single pilot set of experiments showed that about 40 genes were reported as upregulated &amp;gt=2.5 fold in each condition. There was no evidence of altered expression of any MAPK-associated genes. Target genes reported in both conditions (CBFA2T1, ZNF148, ITGA1), and genes altered in one condition (CCS, PLEC1, BIRC5), and marginally altered HSP72 were selected for PCR analysis. No other members of the HSP family were altered. In three replicate experiments assayed by real-time PCR, six genes were either unchanged or showed randomly variable expression. However HSP72 RNA showed possible consistent slight upregulation of 1.37 +/- 0.21 in the chronic condition. Western immunoblots of HSP-60, -70, -72 and -V90 proteins showed no significant changes 5 hours after exposure. In preliminary studies using a serum starvation protocol, ERK-1 phosphorylation was unaltered after 5 or 30 minutes GSM (single experiments). When flasks were transiently cooled, ERK-1 phosphorylation was increased 20 minutes later, indicating a source of artefact in some protocols. An inflammatory challenge experiment with a low-dose of the cytokine IL-1???? found that acute GSM exposure post-challenge inhibited NF????B-mediated GRO???? induction by 1.5 fold (2 experiments). Preconditioning with mild heat induces transient inhibition of both NF????B signalling and apoptosis. Other studies indicate that EMF exposures similarly evoke cytoprotection. It is suggested that GSM evoked cytoprotective signalling in this inflammatory model.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular telephones</field><field name="subject">Mobile phones</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Global system for mobile communications</field><field name="subject">GSM</field><field name="subject">Heat shock proteins</field><field name="subject">Physiological effect</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetic fields</field><field name="subject">Electromagnetism</field><field name="subject">EMF</field><field name="subject">Gene expression</field><field name="subject">Microwaves</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework for understanding factors that intervene between positive evaluations of acquisition candidates and entry into negotiations</field><field name="creator">Connell, Richard B., Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">There are substantial bodies of literature that advance theory about why Merger and Acquisition (M and A) candidates are found to be unattractive, why negotiations aren???t concluded and why the benefits of companies that are acquired are not realized.  Little, if any, research identifies why M and A opportunities are not pursued in the period after candidates are analysed and found to be attractive but before negotiations begin.  This study addresses this period by developing a theoretical framework of the variables that intervene to reverse decisions to pursue apparently attractive candidates before negotiations begin and which, in doing so, result in missed opportunities. The study is informed primarily by the Strategic Management content literature (Ansoff, 1965, Porter, 1980) but draws from the strategy process literature (Huff and Reger, 1987) including streams in Strategic Decision Making (SDM) (Papadakis and Barwise, 1998, Schwenck, 1995). The framework is developed using a multiple-case study method.  This choice was dictated by the study???s theory building objective, the nature of the research questions ??? that is, what variables influence decisions and how? ??? and the lack of an existing theoretical foundation on which to build. The sample consisted of 37 decisions reversals made by 27 firms in Australia, Europe and the USA.  The results suggest that there are three major categories of variables that stop acquirers from pursuing potentially attractive acquisition candidates.  These are related to the acquirers???: ???	Strategy and objectives:  For example, whether there is a change in strategy or objectives, or either or both are poorly understood and agreed between organizational levels or units; ???	Organizational functional resources: For example, whether constraints on appropriate knowledge and skill sets develop or are perceived to be likely to develop during the post-evaluation period; ???	Other financial factors: For example, whether a shortage of funds develops. Twelve individual variables are identified.  Ten of these appear to be consistent with factors that Ansoff and colleagues (1971) associate with post-acquisition failure although variable definitions are not always comparable.  Poor management of the variables thus appears to have the potential to expose acquirers to two different but important vulnerabilities.  First, potentially attractive M and A opportunities may be forgone if the variables are operative in the post-evaluation ??? pre-negotiation period; second, if they don???t become operative until after the acquisition is consummated, the benefits of attractive companies that are acquired may not be realized. This study???s most important contribution is to the theoretically diverse base of acquisition performance literature which, to-date, tends to examine phases in the M and A decision making process before or after the focal period of this study.  It also illustrates the use of a general multi-theoretic model of Strategic Decision Making  (Rajagopolan, et al., 1993, 1998) exclusively in the M and A domain, a domain whose decisions are worthy of study in their own right. Finally, it provides insights into a new set of factors subject to control that managers may take into account in their acquisition planning.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consolidation and merger of corporations</field><field name="subject">business enterprises</field><field name="subject">evaluation</field><field name="subject">corporations</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Nociception, pain and the sympathetic nervous system: neural and effector organ responses in healthy and spinal cord injured human subjects</field><field name="creator">Burton, Alexander Robert, Clinical School - Prince of Wales Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Relatively few studies have examined the effects of nociception pe se on sympathetic nerve activity in awake healthy human subjects. Painful stimuli can produce differential responses from cutaneous and muscle postganglionic sympathetic neurones in the anaesthetised cat, and some animal and human studies suggest that nociceptive stimuli originating in different tissues may produce differential sympathetic effects- deep nociception causing vasodepressive and superficial nociception triggering an excitatory effect on cardiovascular state. It is important to understand how the sympathetic nervous system responds to nociception in healthy subjects in order to make more meaningful comparisons with the behaviour which occurs following damage to sympathetic pathways, e.g. nerve lesions (chronic regional pain syndromes) and spinal cord injury (autonomic dysreflexia (AD)). Additionally, it has been suggested that muscle spindles afferents may play a role in chronic pain, most notably the 'vicious cycle' of pain. While this has been investigated in animal studies, it has not been thoroughly investigated in healthy human subjects. Muscle spindle and sympathetic nerve activity from muscle and skin postganglionic neurones were directly recorded in healthy awake human subjects using microneurography; effector organ responses (blood pressure, heartrate, skin blood flow and sweat release) were recorded in both healthy and spinal cord injured subjects. Deep and superficial nociception was induced by intramuscular and subdermal injections of hypertonic saline given at unexpected times and in quasi-random order. Regardless of the origin of nociception (deep or superficial), general responses tended to be excitatory with increases seen in muscle and skin sympathetic nerve activity, heartrate, blood pressure and sweat release. A gender effect was noted regarding skin blood flow, with males largely showing decreases and females increases. No changes were noted in spindle firing rates and painful stimuli did not significantly increase effector organ responses in spinal cord injured subjects. Contrasting with previous studies, we did not see a differential sympathetic response or change in spindle firing rate to painful stimuli originating in different tissues. While it is believed that noxious stimuli trigger AD, we did not see exaggerated sympathetic responses in spinal cord injured subjects. More investigation is required regarding innocuous triggers of AD.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sympathetic Nervous System</field><field name="subject">Nociception</field><field name="subject">Pain</field><field name="subject">Autonomic Dysreflexia</field><field name="subject">Spinal Cord Injury</field><field name="subject">Microneurography</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mental health and wellbeing of Mandaean refugees</field><field name="creator">Nickerson, Angela Marissa, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This program of research investigated the mental health of Mandaean refugees living in Sydney, Australia (N=315). Participants evidenced high rates of psychological disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, 23%), depression (34%), anger attacks (58%), complicated grief (10%) and impaired mental health-related functioning (42%). Participants also reported high levels of exposure to traumatic events, and experiencing multiple resettlement stressors. It was found that intrusive fear regarding traumatic events that may be experienced by family members remaining in Iraq contributed to PTSD, depression and mental health-related disability over and above the effects of past trauma and post-migration living difficulties. In addition, fear for family predicted frequency of anger attacks beyond the contribution of past trauma, living difficulties and PTSD. Fear of cultural extinction emerged as a salient concern for the Mandaean community, with path analyses revealing it was directly predicted by symptoms of PTSD. The effects of change in visa status on the mental health of Mandaean refugees who had also taken part in a previous survey were explored. Participants who had attained permanent residency status after previously holding Temporary Protection Visas (TPVs) evidenced greater reductions in psychological distress than those who had consistently held permanent residency. Results suggested that that temporary protection may have exerted negative effects on mental health by creating high levels of post-migration living difficulties. Analyses modelling pathways from trauma and loss to other mental health outcomes at both the individual and family levels indicated that grief played a key role in the mental health of the Mandaean community, and that the refugee experience has implications for family mental health and functioning. This thesis represents an attempt to extend knowledge regarding factors that influence refugee mental health, and common psychological outcomes, by examining the relationship between circumstances of ongoing threat to the individual and the collective, family-level processes, and psychological difficulties including PTSD, depression, grief, anger and mental health-related disability. These findings have implications for government policies and service providers working with refugee groups.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Trauma</field><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="subject">Mental health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44529</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dynamic Contribution-based Decomposition Method and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm for Multidisciplinary Engineering Optimisation</field><field name="creator">Xie, Shuiwei , Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A novel decomposition method that is referred to as Contribution-based Decomposition is presented in this thesis. The influence of variables on the values of objective functions and/ or constraints is interpreted as their contributions. Based on contributions of variables, a design problem is decomposed into a number of sub-problems so that variables have similar relative contributions within each sub-problem. The similarity in contributions among variables will lead to an even pressure on the variables when they are driven to better solutions during an optimisation process and, as a result, better solutions can be obtained. Due to nonlinearity of objectives and/ or constrains, variables??? contributions may vary significantly during the solution process. To cope with such variations, a Dynamic Contribution-based Decomposition (DCD) is proposed. By employing DCD, decomposition of system problems is carried out not only at the beginning, but also during the optimisation process, and as a result, the decomposition will always be consistent with the contributions of the current solutions. Further more, a random decomposition is also developed and presented to work in conjunction with the Dynamic Contribution-based Decomposition to introduce re-decompositions when it is required, aiming to increase the global exploring ability.  To solve multidisciplinary engineering optimisation problems more efficiently, new solvers are also developed. These include a mixed discrete variable Pattern Search (MDVPS) algorithm and a mixed discrete variable Genetic Algorithm (MDVGA). Inside the MDVGA, new techniques including a flexible floating-point encoding method, a non-dominance ranking strategy and heuristic crossover and mutation operators are also developed to avoid premature convergence and enhance the GA???s search ability. Both MDVPS and MDVGA are able to handle optimisation problems having mixed discrete variables. The former algorithm is more capable of local searching and the latter has better global search ability. A hybrid solver is proposed, which incorporates the MDVPS and the MDVGA and takes advantage of both their strengths.  Lastly, a Dynamic Sub-space Optimisation (DSO) method is developed by employing the proposed Dynamic Contribution-based Decomposition methods and the hybrid solver. By employing DSO, decomposed sub-problems can be solved without explicit coordination.  To demonstrate the capability of the proposed methods and algorithms, a range of test problems have been exercised and the results are documented.  Collectively the results show significant improvements over other published popular approaches.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">contribution</field><field name="subject">Optimisation</field><field name="subject">Dynamic decomposition</field><field name="subject">Hybrid Genetic Algorithm</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43899</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development and infrastructure in marginalised communities: safe drinking water in rural Bangladesh</field><field name="creator">Rammelt, Crelis Ferdinand, Institute of Environmental Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">The poor in most developing countries are persistently marginalised in their living conditions, including their access to safe drinking water. The research objectives have been (1) to better understand why this state of affairs has endured despite decades of efforts and interventions, and (2) to propose more adequate alternatives. The central case study was concerned with drinking water in rural Bangladesh ?? a matter of grave urgency since the discovery of arsenic in the groundwater more than a decade ago. Millions of users are exposed to dangerous levels of contamination, and the implementation of solutions has been slow and inadequate. Little has been done so far to integrate the research on this complex humanitarian crisis.  Many have argued that conventional views on development are ill-equipped to address the ??growing gap?? between rich and poor; the models often fail to interpret inequity beyond mere financial indicators. This thesis therefore puts forward a different analytical framework (based on the theoretical concepts of core-periphery and capital stock). This was designed to increase our understanding of marginalisation by taking into account unequal ownership of, entitlement to, and control over, ecological, technological, organisational and human assets.  Through an action research methodology, this analytical framework was informed by a participatory programme that established safe drinking water supplies in several poor and arsenic-affected villages. The learning experience was then fed back into the programme. This pragmatic approach was also systemic, i.e., it emphasised the community level, which was framed within the context of external influences, various other programmes and national policies.  This resulted in a clarification of the problem in terms of (1) lack of ownership of community land, resources, drinking water institutions and technical knowledge; (2) restricted access to (non-) governmental services and benefits from public or collective assets; and (3) exclusion from decision-making in new water sector developments. It was concluded that alternative strategies need to focus on vesting ownership, entitlement and control in marginalised communities. The steps to achieve this will have far-reaching ramifications for how organisations, policymakers and funding agencies perceive and plan development projects.  The analytical and methodological approach of this thesis is relevant to other cases of marginalisation in different socio-economic contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bangladesh</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Drinking</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="subject">Development</field><field name="subject">Poverty</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44524</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effects of exercise and dietary intervention on metabolic syndrome markers of inactive premenopausal women</field><field name="creator">Dunn, Sarah Louise, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The effects of exercise and dietary intervention on metabolic syndrome (Mets) markers of inactive premenopausal women were investigated. In Study I, early markers of MetS were examined in young, (21.2 ?? 0.3 years), healthy but unfit women (N = 66) consuming a processed food diet. A second aim was to examine the relationship between ethnic influences (European versus Chinese) and early markers of MetS (e.g., hyperinsulinemia). Study II compared the hormonal and metabolic responses to steady state exercise (SSE) and high intensity interval exercise (HIIE) in untrained young women (N = 18, 21.7 ?? 0.8 years). Women were further divided into high and low fasting insulin levels to determine if hyperinsulinemia influenced hormonal and metabolic response to SSE and HIIE. Study III examined the hormonal and metabolic response to a randomized controlled intervention named the Fish oil, Exercise and Mediterranean diet (FEM) trial. The FEM trial was conducted with overweight, inactive young (23.5 ?? 0.6 years) women (N = 56) for 12 weeks. Characteristics of a subset of women (N = 34, 23.5 ?? 0.7 years) in the FEM trial, non-responders (NRES), who did not lose weight (??? 1% loss in mass), were also examined. Metabolic profiles were developed based on body composition, aerobic fitness, blood markers, diet, resting metabolic rate, medical history, blood pressure, and autonomic function. Body composition was measured by skinfolds and girths, bioimpedance (Tanita, Japan), and Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry. Peak oxygen uptake was assessed using an open circuit spirometer, TrueMax 2400 Metabolic Cart. Venepuncture and cannulation techniques were used for collecting blood samples that were also centrifuged and frozen for later analysis.	In Study I young women who were physically unfit and consumed a processed food diet possessed high levels of fasting insulin, HOMA-IR (an insulin resistance index), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Insulin, p &lt; .001, and HOMA-IR, p &lt; .05, were significantly greater in Chinese Australians compared to European Australians, whereas plasma CRP levels were significantly, p &lt; .05, lower. Significant differences, p &lt; .05, existed between the groups with the Chinese Australians possessing lower body composition indices. However, ethnic differences still existed for insulin, HOMA-IR, and CRP after adjusting for body composition. Both groups consumed significantly high protein relative to their body mass. Thus, it appears that hyperinsulinemia is one of the earliest markers of MetS in young inactive females of both European and Asian descent who are unfit and consume a high level of dietary protein.  In Study II, HIIE compared to SSE proved to be more effective at preventing an increase in insulin levels in the two hours after exercise. Resting respiratory quotient (RQ) was significantly lower, p &lt; .05, following both HIIE and SSE, whereas plasma glycerol levels were higher, p = .06, suggesting greater lipolysis following HIIE. The women were divided by baseline fasting plasma insulin (&gt; 9.98 ??IU/ml) into high insulin (HI) and low insulin groups (LI). The fasting plasma human growth hormone levels of the HI women were significantly lower at baseline compared to that of LI women. Baseline RQ was correlated with baseline glycerol, r = - .54, p &lt; .05. Insulin levels at one hour post HIIE was related to fasting plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) one hour post exercise, r = .52, p &lt; .05. Fasting plasma leptin at one, r = .56, p &lt; .05, and two, r = .53, p &lt; .05, hours post exercise was associated with 2 hour post insulin levels. Interestingly, fasting ACTH was significantly elevated in the 2 hours post exercise in the HI women compared to LI. All diet data between the groups were similar and lipids were in the healthy range with no significant differences between the women possessing high or low fasting plasma insulin. Thus, young women who completed one session of short duration HIIE compared to SSE improved certain aspects of their metabolic profile (e.g., reduced insulin levels) and enhanced their fat oxidation in the immediate two-hour exercise recovery period. Following FEM (a 12-week multi-component lifestyle intervention) overweight women recorded significantly lower, p &lt; .05, body composition (mass, fat mass, percent body fat, waist circumference), insulin, inflammation (CRP), blood pressure, and lipids. The improvements within the Mediterranean diet (Mediet) were related to the reductions in body weight, fat mass, and insulin. Consumption of saturated fats, legumes, meat, poultry, and egg were also significantly decreased, p &lt; .05, following the trial. Adherence to the Mediet and fish oil consumption, measured through a Mediet score, was significantly increased, p &lt; .001, and was associated with reduced levels of fat mass, r = .43, p &lt; .05. Autonomic function (measured by power frequency analysis), aerobic fitness, and fat oxidation were all significantly, p &lt; .05, enhanced. Therefore, an intervention incorporating fish oil consumption, HIIE, and Mediet significantly reduced body fat, fasting insulin, inflammatory markers, and some blood lipids. Interestingly, some women did not lose fat mass following the FEM intervention, despite experiencing significant reductions in insulin, inflammation, waist circumference, blood pressure, and an increase in aerobic power. The major differences between those women who lost fat and those that did not was that the non-responders possessed significantly lower, p &lt; .05, systolic blood pressure, lower resting heart rate, and a higher resting RQ. In summary, in Study I, young, unfit women consuming a processed diet, demonstrated hyperinsulinemia and low grade inflammation. The high levels of fasting insulin suggest that these women are at a higher risk for developing MetS and type 2 diabetes.  The results of Study II suggests that one bout of HIIE compared to a longer bout of SSE was more effective at preventing a rise in post-exercise insulin levels. Finally, results of Study III indicate that a 12-week lifestyle intervention, encompassing HIIE, fish oil ingestion, and a Mediet positively influenced early MetS markers (e.g., hyperinsulinemia), aerobic and anaerobic fitness, low grade inflammation, and body composition in young women.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fat Loss</field><field name="subject">Exercise</field><field name="subject">Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Diet</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43914</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Neural network based identification and control of an unmanned helicopter</field><field name="creator">Samal, Mahendra, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research work provides the development of an Adaptive Flight Control System  (AFCS) for autonomous hover of a Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV).  Due to the complex, nonlinear and time-varying dynamics of the RUAV, indirect  adaptive control using the Model Predictive Control (MPC) is utilised.  The performance of the MPC mainly depends on the model of the RUAV used for  predicting the future behaviour. Due to the complexities associated with the RUAV  dynamics, a neural network based black box identification technique is used for  modelling the behaviour of the RUAV. Auto-regressive neural network architecture  is developed for offline and online modelling purposes. A hybrid modelling technique  that exploits the advantages of both the offline and the online models is proposed.  In the hybrid modelling technique, the predictions from the offline trained model  are corrected by using the error predictions from the online model at every sample  time. To reduce the computational time for training the neural networks, a principal  component analysis based algorithm that reduces the dimension of the input training  data is also proposed. This approach is shown to reduce the computational time  significantly. These identification techniques are validated in numerical simulations  before flight testing in the Eagle and RMAX helicopter platforms.  Using the successfully validated models of the RUAVs, Neural Network based  Model Predictive Controller (NN-MPC) is developed taking into account the non-linearity of the RUAVs and constraints into consideration. The parameters of the  MPC are chosen to satisfy the performance requirements imposed on the flight controller. The optimisation problem is solved numerically using nonlinear optimisation  techniques. The performance of the controller is extensively validated using numerical simulation models before flight testing. The effects of actuator and sensor delays  and noises along with the wind gusts are taken into account during these numerical  simulations. In addition, the robustness of the controller is validated numerically  for possible parameter variations. The numerical simulation results are compared  with a base-line PID controller.  Finally, the NN-MPCs are flight tested for height control and autonomous hover.  For these, SISO as well as multiple SISO controllers are used. The flight tests are  conducted in varying weather conditions to validate the utility of the control technique. The NN-MPC in conjunction with the proposed hybrid modelling technique  is shown to handle additional disturbances successfully. Extensive flight test results  provide justification for the use of the NN-MPC technique as a reliable technique  for control of non-linear complex dynamic systems such as RUAVs.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Model Predictive Control (MPC)</field><field name="subject">Adaptive Flight Control System</field><field name="subject">Rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (RUAV).</field><field name="subject">Auto-regressive neural network architecture</field><field name="subject">non-linear complex dynamic systems</field><field name="subject">Drone aircraft</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43917</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Low Velocity Impact Behaviour of Unreinforced Bi-layer Plastic Laminates</field><field name="creator">Ramakrishnan, Karthik Ram, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Low velocity impact behaviour of bi-layered laminates of acrylic and polycarbonate was investigated using a combination of drop tower impact experiments and explicit finite element analysis in LS-DYNA. Material characterisation tests were conducted in tension and in compression to obtain material properties for input to the material model in the numerical analysis. Quasistatic plate bending tests were conducted at different loading rates to compare the quasistatic response of the materials to the impact behaviour. Impact tests on circular plates of monolithic acrylic and polycarbonate were carried out using an instrumented drop weight impact tester. The impact force histories were recorded and a multiparameter approach was used to determine critical energy. Acrylic exhibited radial cracking, spalling and pene- tration while polycarbonate underwent large deformation and failed by dishing and plugging. The damage caused by impact in the bilayered laminate included partial or full delamination at the interface and radial cracks in the acrylic layer. The low velocity impact responses were simulated using 8-noded solid elements in LS- DYNA. A node-splitting technique based on maximum tensile stress failure criterion and an erosion approach based on maximum principal stress criteria was used to model the failure of acrylic. A material model that takes into account the asym- metric behaviour in tension and compression was investigated. The delamination between the acrylic and polycarbonate plate was modelled by a tiebreak contact with a shear strength based failure. The results of the finite element simulations are in good agreement with the experimental data.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bilayered laminate : impact testing</field><field name="subject">Laminated plastics :  impact testing</field><field name="subject">Laminated materials :  impact testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43918</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the influence of fines on liquefaction behaviour</field><field name="creator">Rahman, Md. Mizanur, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Traditionally, void ratio, e has been used as a state variable for predicting the liquefaction behaviour of soils under the Critical State (Steady State) framework. Recent publications show that void ratio, e may not be a good parameter for characterizing sand with fines as the steady state, SS data points move downward in e-log(p&#61602;) space up to certain fines content termed as threshold fines content, TFC. Thus, it was difficult to apply SS concept on sand with fines as a small variation of fines content may lead to different SS line. Many researchers proposed to used equivalent granular void ratio, e* as an alternative state variable (i.e. in lieu of void ratio, e) in attempt to obtain a narrow trend line for SS data points irrespective of fc provided fc &#61603; TFC. The e* is obtained from e. For the conversion from e to e*, one need a parameter b which presents the active fraction of fines in overall force structure of sand. However, predicting the b is problematic. Most, if not all, of the b reported were determined by case-specific back-analysis, that is, the b-value was selected so that the test results for a given sand-fines type could be correlated with the equivalent granular void ratio, e* irrespective of fines content. This thesis examines the factors that affecting the b value by examining published work on binary packing. This leads to a simple semi-empirical equation for predicting the value of b based onparticle size ratio, &#61539; and fines content, fc. Published data and experimental results on Sydney sand appears to be in support of the proposed equation. The single relation of SS data points in e*-log(p&#61602;) space for sand with fines is referred as Equivalent Granular Steady State Line, EG-SSL. The EG-SSL is then used to define the equivalent granular state parameter,&#61561;*. A good correlation observed between &#61561;* and q-p&#61602;, q-&#61541; q responses in undrained shearing. The e* and &#61561;* are also used to modified a state dependent constitutive model. Seven model input parameters are needed in addition four to critical state input parameters. These parameters are obtained from drained test. The model is used to predict q-p&#61602;and q-&#61541; q responses for flow, non-flow and limited flow behaviour for 0% to 30% fines contents. The model predictions are in good agreement with experimental results. The effect of fines types (in terms of plasticity and angularity) on the prediction equation of b are also examined with four different types of fines. A negligible effect of fines type on the prediction equation of b is observed.

It examines the trading behaviour of institutional equity funds in relation to investment style drift and dividend payments to assess whether trading is beneficial to investors in these funds.  The analysis of investment style is relevant because of the prominence of multiple manager funds in Australia, while institutional investor preferences for dividend income will impact the after-tax return of fund investors.   Firstly, monthly equity fund portfolio holdings are used to examine the magnitude of investment style drift.  Institutional investor style tilts are consistent with their self-stated investment objective.  Decomposing style drift into active and passive components reveals that institutions retain a desired portfolio tilt by actively adjusting their portfolio holdings in response to passive style drift.  Furthermore, funds are most responsive to changes in book-to-market and momentum drift, with style drift affecting portfolio turnover.  Secondly, the dissertation presents an equilibrium framework of dividend valuation and ex-dividend trading under Australia??s imputation tax system.  An examination of returns, volume, and order imbalance in the Australian equity market shows that investors value dividends.  The results are consistent with long-term investors accelerating trades to the cum-dividend period and short-term traders targeting fully franked, high yielding dividends with a small bid-ask spread.  Franking credits possess a positive value for the majority of the sample while transaction costs impede the efficient adjustment of prices on the ex-dividend day.  The results show that a 45-day holding period rule reduces the amount of short-term trading from July 1999. Thirdly, the dissertation places the ex-dividend trading behaviour of institutional equity funds in the context of the findings for the Australian equity market.  Institutions accelerate their sales of long-term holdings to the cum-dividend period, and delay purchases until the ex-dividend period to avoid dividends.  Institutional trading is consistent with the provision of liquidity to short-term traders that are attempting to capture both dividends and franking credits.  The introduction of a long-term capital gains tax discount in 1999 entices institutions to trade in a more tax-efficient manner by selling long-term holdings prior to the ex-dividend day.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dividends</field><field name="subject">Institutional investors</field><field name="subject">Investment Style</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44406</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Managing creative and health production processes : issues, similarities and differences</field><field name="creator">Hillier, Fleur Jane, School of Public Health &amp; community medicine. Centre for Clinical Governance Research in Health, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis I am concerned to examine the management behaviours and predilections of managers across the two settings of health and theatre considered to be divergent.  To do this I explore and map methods, similarities and differences managers employ to ???manage??? workers across the industries.  I also deconstruct creativity and its manifestations in both managerial behaviours and environmental contexts and map the complexity issues that managers face in different settings.  Further, I explore the extent to which management activity is contextual to the identity of participant organisational aims and processes and examine the level of calculated chaos experienced by managers across the settings.  Central to this approach is the utilisation of multi-method design incorporating interview, micro-ethnography, auto-ethnography and a RAND expert panel to assist with interpretation of the results.  Core findings include high degrees of similarity in the roles and functions and support systems utilised by managers across the settings despite substantial differences in environmental contexts and organisational aims and processes.  Differences were identified in the areas of: levels of chaos, interactions, purposes, and environmental characteristics.  To account for these differences I apprehended seven metafactors grounded in the data sets.  These seven metafactors can be found in each setting but emerge in different ways.  The metafactors that I apprehend are order versus disorder; creativity; experimentation and change; risk; reflection; trust and respect; and time and pressure.  While I discuss these seven metafactors as separate factors in reality they are fundamentally inter-related.

Previous work has categorised a wild type p53 gene in the majority of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cases, in which instance the p53 protein functions as a modulator of chemotherapy-induced cell death. In contrast, certain p53-induced proteins, such as p21WAF1, can act in an anti-apoptotic manner, and bestow resistance to chemotherapy. Previous studies of the p53 pathway in ALL have utilised cell lines and primary material. In this study a model of ALL was utilised that had previously been developed from a heterogeneous panel of patient biopsies established as xenografts in immune-deficient mice, and are adaptable for short term in vitro culture. A wild-type p53 protein response to etoposide and nutlin-3 exposure was a feature of the whole ALL xenograft panel, irrespective of clinical characteristics and disease biology. While a range of p53 target genes were induced in B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and T-ALL xenografts after etoposide exposure, there was negligible induction of p21WAF1 in T- ALL samples. Further work with the histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat facilitated p53-independent induction of p21WAF1 in BCP-ALL samples, yet failed to induce p21WAF1 in T- ALL. An association was observed between reduced p21WAF1 expression in the T-ALL samples and decreased histone H3 acetylation in the p21WAF1 promoter together with increased cytosine methylation in the first exon/intron of the p21WAF1 gene. These results suggest that p21WAF1 in T-ALL cells is subject to epigenetic modifications that cause transcriptional silencing. Defective induction of p21WAF1 in T-ALL xenografts was associated with increased sensitivity to the death-inducing effects of drugs, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalisation and caspase-3/-7 activity after drug exposure, indicating that p21WAF1 may exert an anti-apoptotic activity. As proof of principle, p21WAF1 was silenced in Nalm-6 cells by micro-RNA transduction and these cells exhibited increased sensitivity and rapid PS externalisation after drug exposure. A combination of a p21WAF1 inhibitory agent and vorinostat gave some pharmacological evidence to suggest that p21WAF1 inhibition could enhance drug efficacy. Overall, these investigations provide insight into the epigenetic regulation of p21WAF1 and demonstrate an anti-apoptotic role for p21WAF1 in childhood ALL cells.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cell death</field><field name="subject">Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</field><field name="subject">p21WAF1</field><field name="subject">Apoptosis</field><field name="subject">Vorinostat</field><field name="subject">p53</field><field name="subject">Xenograft</field><field name="subject">Epigenetics</field><field name="subject">Phosphatidylserine</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Matric suction response of unbound granular base materials subject to cyclic loading</field><field name="creator">Craciun, Ovidiu, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The emergence of analytically-based pavement design has encouraged investigations toward a better understanding of the behaviour of pavement layers under cyclic loading. Unbound granular base (UGB) materials are commonly placed as base course layers in the design of pavement foundations. Due to their nature and geometry they are unsaturated geo-materials and therefore, it is desirable to study their behaviour using the framework of unsaturated soil mechanics. Current literature reflects very limited achievements in this direction.  This thesis presents the development of a cyclic triaxial testing system and associated testing methodology that meets the challenges of testing an UGB material as an unsaturated soil. The testing system enables the initialisation of a specimen to target matric suction and facilitates direct measurement of its evolution under cyclic loading.  In conjunction with the use of accurate on-specimens strain measurement transducers, ???clean??? strain and matric suction cyclic responses are obtained. Two types of cyclic triaxial testing are investigated: with constant cell pressure (i.e., CSeries testing) and with varying (cyclic) cell pressure where both axial and radial stress components are simultaneously (and in phase) pulsed (i.e., V-Series testing). Different initial matric suctions, si will be imposed in the testing program and the influence of si on material behaviour is analysed. This is investigated in a similar manner for C- and V-Series testing. The influence of si appears to be significant for both cyclic and permanent strain responses. A strong stress path dependency is found to characterise the behaviour of the UGB material. Under a wide range of cyclic deviator stress magnitudes, permanent strain response is found to correlate with that of matric suction response. Both appear to indicate better the relative performance of a UGB material than the response of resilient modulus. Another particular aspect investigated is the influence of additional fines on the behaviour of the UGB material. To ???isolate??? the effects of additional fines the cyclic and permanent strain responses of ???equivalent??? specimens with equivalent compaction and unsaturation condition, but different fines content, are compared. The results showed that the relative performance of the two materials (distinguished by the different percentage of fines content) in intertwined with the strong stress path dependency. It is also found that a material compacted at higher dry density may not improve its behaviour under cyclic loading, but may worsen with load cycles. Soil-water characteristic curve tests are conducted for the UGB materials investigated, showing high sensitivity of initial matric suction to moisture content, which increases further for the material with additional fines. This explains the notion of ???sensitivity??? of UGB materials as commonly suggested by practicing pavement engineers.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Pavements : subgrades, testing</field><field name="subject">Pavements : design and construction</field><field name="subject">Pavements : materials, testing</field><field name="subject">Pavements : performance, testing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The formation of visual as concept and practice in art education</field><field name="creator">Barbousas, Joanna , Art History &amp; Art Education, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the formation of visual as discursive practice.

With a particular focus on Michel Foucault???s methods of history, archaeology and genealogy, art education as discipline is mapped through an investigation of visual as concept and practice. This research contends that the emergence of current practices in visual culture, as configured within the constraints of art education amplifies the conditions of visual to define art education as a field. It examines the mobilisation of discourse, verified by discipline formations in art education, and the way in which such formations distribute and categorise knowledge that is sequenced within power structures. Therefore, visual, as a discursive practice is one way through which to trace the conditions of the field, including the structure of discipline as knowledge and subject in art education.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Disciplinarity</field><field name="subject">Michel Foucault</field><field name="subject">Visual Culture</field><field name="subject">Discourse Analysis</field><field name="subject">Visuality</field><field name="subject">Genealogy</field><field name="subject">Discipline Formations</field><field name="subject">Art Education</field><field name="subject">Discourses of Technology</field><field name="subject">Discourses of the Child</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/43928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inorganic hydrogeochemistry, hydrogeology and geology of the Stuarts Point aquifer system : a process analysis of the natural occurrences of enriched As(III) and As(V) in an Australian coastal groundwater system</field><field name="creator">Smith, James V.  S., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Arsenic (As) in groundwater systems is a problem in many parts of the world owing to ever-increasing extraction of groundwater resources to meet the needs of growing populations. Surprisingly, the occurrence of elevated As concentrations in coastal sandy aquifers has only recently been published as a result of this research. Sandy aquifers are commonly used as a clean and reliable source of water for domestic, agricultural and industrial needs due to their high recharge rates and the filtering capacity of sands. Water quality monitoring in Australian sandy aquifers is usually limited to a small suite of major elements and salinity measurements to determine the quality of groundwater and to identify any potential problems from seawater intrusion as a result of over extraction. Minor and trace elements, particularly toxic elements, have largely been ignored in regular monitoring programs. Prompted by an emerging pattern of human health problems in a community reliant on groundwater, hydrogeochemical investigations of the Stuarts Point coastal sand aquifer, on the North Coast of New South Wales, Australia, identified elevated As concentrations of up to 337 ????g/L in the catchment's Pleistocene barrier sands. These concentrations are well in excess of the World Health Organisation and the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council water quality criteria of 10 and 7 ????g/L respectively. From research into the Stuarts Point geology, geochemistry, geomorphology, hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry, and with the assistance of environmental isotopes, the spatial distribution, occurrence and mobilisation processes of As were determined. The presence and distribution of elevated As concentrations in the regional coastal aquifer system are sporadic and involve a series of complex hydrogeochemical processes. No single hydrogeochemical process can describe the release of As from solid phase to groundwater system on the regional scale. Processes of competitive exchange with PO43- and HCO3-, reductive dissolution of Fe oxyhydroxides and arsenical pyrite oxidation, though not forming dominant correlations, are still evident and influence As chemistry at this scale. Detailed investigations of the hydrogeochemistry on the vertical scale have identified two main processes as causing As to be released and mobilised. The first process is associated with the oxidation of arsenical pyrite in Acid Sulphate Soils and metal hydrolysis reactions which mobilise As in the acidic environment. In the absence of dissolved oxygen (DO), NO3- acts as the oxyanion facilitating arsenical pyrite oxidation and releasing As into solution. The second process that mobilises As from the sediments is the liberation of As from metal-oxyhydroxides in the carbon-rich environment, where HCO3- originates from the dissolution of shell material in the Pleistocene barrier sands. The marine influenced depositional history and geomorphology of the aquifer provide opportunities for As to become incorporated into the aquifers matrix in a variety of mineral forms, which is an occurrence not considered to be unique to the Stuarts Point catchment. The findings presented here are amongst the first detailed studies of naturally occurring As in an Australian groundwater system as well as in the Pleistocene coastal sand aquifer environment. The understanding of As accumulation and mobilisation identified as a result of this research emphasises the need for potential As occurrences in similar groundwater systems in other coastal environments in Australia, and globally, to be considered.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aquifers</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Kempsey</field><field name="subject">Groundwater</field><field name="subject">Water</field><field name="subject">Pollution</field><field name="subject">Arsenic</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22349</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immunological and virological correlates of persistent illness following primary Epstein-Barr virus infection</field><field name="creator">Cameron, Barbara, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Primary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in childhood is typically asymptomatic, but infection later in life results in a mononucleosis with the illness severity ranging from asymptomatic to requiring hospitalisation. The illness is generally short-lived (four to six weeks following onset of symptoms), but persistent disabling symptoms (lasting up to 6 months or longer) are well described in around ten percent of individuals. The aim of this work was to characterise immunological and virological parameters in the peripheral blood, which correlate with persistence of symptoms following EBV-induced mononucleosis. Subjects were recruited prospectively following confirmed primary EBV infection, to allow blood samples and clinical data to be collected at multiple timepoints (baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 3 months and at least 12 months later). Subjects with 6 months or more of disabling symptoms were defined as ???cases??? with control subjects being those whose illness resolved within 6 weeks of enrolment. Cases were compared with control subjects in terms of: cellular EBV viral load in the peripheral blood by PCR; development of antibodies against EBV VCA (IgG and IgM) and EBNA-1 (IgG) by ELISA; proportions of peripheral blood leucocyte subsets and their activation status by flow cytometry; the magnitude, kinetics of development, and breadth of the CD8+ cytotoxic cell response by interferon-?? Elispot; cytokine levels in serum, and production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells ex vivo; and gene expression patterns in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by microarray. With the exception of gene expression, none of these parameters correlated with early resolution of symptoms or predicted clinical outcome following primary EBV infection. Antibody patterns suggest a tendency to Th2 type immune response may be associated with persistent illness. Preliminary analysis of the gene expression studies indicates that there are many genes involved in this complex disease requiring further investigation. Persistent illness following EBV infection is not associated with uncontrolled viral  replication, or chronic immune activation due to an aberrant primary immune response.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Epstein-Barr virus</field><field name="subject">Epstein-Barr virus diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22373</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Friction : ???the umbrella encounters the sewing machine???</field><field name="creator">Hansen, Eric Alfred, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">I intend, with this thesis, to investigate how Michel Foucault's concept of ???a positive unconscious of knowledge??? can be illustrated by overlapping narrative segments. I have coined the term ???friction???, as a writing practice, to describe the space in-between narrative conception and conscious, ordered reflection upon that narrative. Thus, the thesis comprises an exploration of Foucault's intersecting marginal zone, which is an integral aspect of his philosophic concept of ???positive unconscious???. The ???positive unconscious??? is where the overlapping sections of what Foucault calls, a ???table??? (creative narrative) and ???tabula??? (the ordering of the narrative) are situated. The frictional form is synonymous with Foucault's concept. It is as a developing narrative conception that becomes an ordered practice, and also aims to be what Jacques Derrida calls ???a new writing???. Hence, Foucault's ???positive unconscious???, Derrida's ???new writing???, and the frictional narrative process all comprise, along with and through the multiple inclusions of myriad theorists, philosophers, fiction writers, lyric poets, etc., an amalgamated whole ???new??? narrative (the frictionalised thesis). The paradox of the ???new??? (frictional) narrative is that through mimesis comes characterised difference - a ???new??? hybridised space is opened up which both fascinates and appals, railing as it does against fixed, constraining and systematised linguistic and discursive structures. Yet this is a stimulating space that ultimately brings new focus to stifling self-conformity. It is a frictional space comprised of a profusion of literary ???voices??? made singular, a singularity that is also mutiplicitous in its composite origin. It is a frictional observance that refutes the injunction of needing definite closure given its inclusion of potentially unlimited sources.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narration Rhetoric</field><field name="subject">Foucault</field><field name="subject">Michel</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22376</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Pricing and hedging S&amp;P 500 index options : a comparison of affine jump diffusion models</field><field name="creator">Gleeson, Cameron, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the empirical performance of four Affine Jump Diffusion models in pricing and hedging S&amp;P 500 Index options: the Black Scholes (BS) model, Heston???s Stochastic Volatility (SV) model, a Stochastic Volatility Price Jump (SVJ) model and a Stochastic Volatility Price-Volatility Jump (SVJJ) model. The SVJJ model structure allows for simultaneous jumps in price and volatility processes, with correlated jump size distributions. To the best of our knowledge this is the first empirical study to test the hedging performance of the SVJJ model. As part of our research we derive the SVJJ model minimum variance hedge ratio.  We find the SVJ model displays the best price prediction. The SV model lacks the structural complexity to eliminate Black Scholes pricing biases, whereas our results indicate the SVJJ model suffers from overfitting.  Despite significant evidence from in and out-of-sample pricing that the SV and SVJ models were better specified than the BS model, this did not result in an improvement in dynamic hedging performance. Overall the BS delta hedge and SV minimum variance hedge produced the lowest errors, although their performance across moneyness-maturity categories differed greatly. The SVJ model???s results were surprisingly poor given its superior performance in out-of-sample pricing. We attribute the inadequate performance of the jump models to the lower hedging ratios these models provided, which may be a result of the negative expected jump sizes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Option Pricing</field><field name="subject">Affine Jump Diffusion</field><field name="subject">Stochastic Volatility</field><field name="subject">Hedging Finance</field><field name="subject">Options Finance</field><field name="subject">Prices</field><field name="subject">Jump processes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22379</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Policy in question: from problem solving to problematology</field><field name="creator">Turnbull, Nicholas James, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the postpositivist critique of the policy sciences, policy theory has come into question. More particularly, the ???problem orientation??? upon which Lasswell defined the policy sciences has come into question because policy making does not conform to his problem solving logic. That logic is inadequate. I argue that we must reconsider the problem orientation at a philosophical level to reconstruct it upon a more appropriate foundation. This thesis does not depict how we should conduct policy making but deals with foundational concepts and issues. I draw on Michel Meyer's new philosophy of questioning, problematology, to consider policy theory in terms of questioning and to reconstruct the problem orientation on problematological grounds.  The thesis is in two parts. Part I reviews and critiques past policy theory in terms of questioning, commencing from the problem solving basis of Dewey's philosophy and Lasswell???s ???policy sciences???. I criticise this basis and outline how it made politics and argumentation residual aspects of reason. I discuss how the postpositivist critique problematised the policy sciences and how this permits us to pose policy theory itself as a question. Part II answers this question by reconstructing policy theory upon the problematological foundation of knowledge. Meyer???s logic of questioning incorporates problematicity in answering, allowing us to account for the politics of policy. I outline the dynamic nature of the logic of questioning and how it incorporates key concepts of interpretative epistemology; hermeneutics, dialectic, and rhetoric. I conclude by describing policy making as a synthesis of two questions: the policy question and the question of legitimacy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">policy sciences</field><field name="subject">problematology</field><field name="subject">philosophy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22382</field></doc><doc><field name="title">CFD modeling of heat exchange fouling</field><field name="creator">Walker, Patrick Gareth, Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heat exchanger fouling is the deposition of material onto the heat transfer surface causing a reduction in thermal efficiency.  A study using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was conducted to increase understanding of key aspects of fouling in desalination processes.  Fouling is a complex phenomenon and therefore this numerical model was developed in stages.  Each stage required a critical assessment of each fouling process in order to design physical models to describe the process???s intricate kinetic and thermodynamic behaviour.  The completed physical models were incorporated into the simulations through employing extra transport equations, and coding additional subroutines depicting the behaviour of the aqueous phase involved in the fouling phenomena prominent in crystalline streams.  The research objectives of creating a CFD model to predict fouling behaviour and assess the influence of key operating parameters were achieved.  The completed model of the key crystallisation fouling processes monitors the temporal variation of the fouling resistance.  The fouling rates predicted from these results revealed that the numerical model satisfactorily reproduced the phenomenon observed experimentally.  Inspection of the CFD results at a local level indicated that the interface temperature was the most influential operating parameter.  The research also examined the likelihood that the crystallisation and particulate fouling mechanisms coexist.  It was found that the distribution of velocity increased the likelihood of the particulate phase forming within the boundary layer, thus emphasizing the importance of differentiating between behaviour within the bulk and the boundary layer.  These numerical results also implied that the probability of this composite fouling was greater in turbulent flow.  Finally, supersaturation was confirmed as the key parameter when precipitation occurred within the bulk/boundary layer.  This investigation demonstrated the advantages of using CFD to assess heat exchanger fouling.  It produced additional physical models which when incorporated into the CFD code adequately modeled key aspects of the crystallisation and particulate fouling mechanisms.  These innovative modelling ideas should encourage extensive use of CFD in future fouling investigations.  It is recommended that further work include detailed experimental data to assist in defining the key kinetic and thermodynamic parameters to extend the scope of the required physical models.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">crystallisation fouling</field><field name="subject">computational fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">heat transfer</field><field name="subject">desalination</field><field name="subject">heat exchangers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22385</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Language identification with language and feature dependency</field><field name="creator">Yin, Bo, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of Language Identification (LID) is to identify a specific language from a spoken utterance, automatically. Language-specific characteristics are always associated with different languages. Most existing LID approaches utilise a statistical modelling process with common acoustic/phonotactic features to model specific languages while avoiding any language-specific knowledge. Great successes have been achieved in this area over past decades. However, there is still a huge gap between these languageindependent methods and the actual language-specific patterns. It is extremely useful to address these specific acoustic or semantic construction patterns, without spending huge labour on annotation which requires language-specific knowledge. Inspired by this goal, this research focuses on the language-feature dependency. Several practical methods have been proposed. Various features and modelling techniques have been studied in this research. Some of them carry out additional language-specific information without manual labelling, such as a novel duration modelling method based on articulatory features, and a novel Frequency-Modulation (FM) based feature. The performance of each individual feature is studied for each of the language-pair combinations. The similarity between languages and the contribution in identifying a language by using a particular feature are defined for the first time, in a quantitative style. These distance measures and languagedependent contributions become the foundations of the later-presented frameworks ?? language-dependent weighting and hierarchical language identification. The latter particularly provides remarkable flexibility and enhancement when identifying a relatively large number of languages and accents, due to the fact that the most discriminative feature or feature-combination is used when separating each of the languages. The proposed systems are evaluated in various corpora and task contexts including NIST language recognition evaluation tasks. The performances have been improved in various degrees. The key techniques developed for this work have also been applied to solve a different problem other than LID ?? speech-based cognitive load monitoring.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Language distance</field><field name="subject">Language identification</field><field name="subject">Language-feature dependency</field><field name="subject">Language clustering</field><field name="subject">Fusion</field><field name="subject">Audio classification</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44045</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A review of critical coning rate correlations and identifying the most reliable equation</field><field name="creator">Khalili, Ali, Petroleum engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The study of coning in oil production is important because of huge water production associated with oil production around the world each year. Estimation of critical coning rate has been the subject of numerous studies and a number of correlations have been reported.

The various methods and correlations are compared and the assumptions on which they are based evaluated. Following comparison made between the correlations, the most reliable theories are identified for both vertical and horizontal wells separately. Among the correlations for vertical wells, this study recommends two implicit methods presented by Wheatley and Azar Nejad et al. They determined the oil potential distribution influenced by water cone with a remarkable accuracy. For horizontal wells, two methods, Joshi???s equation and Rechem et al formula, are considered to be the most reliable. Joshi???s equation provides lower estimates than Chaperon???s correlation in which the water cone effect on oil potential was neglected. The Recham et al formula also gives a similar result.

However, external costs are associated with these benefits. Any increase in aircraft movement causes negative environmental impacts, especially noise pollution. Governments have reduced aircraft noise levels at their sources, or introduced aircraft noise management strategies (ANMS); however the problems have never been satisfactorily resolved. This research aims at developing a better understanding of the impacts of aircraft noise on community health and well-being by exploring two core research questions: (1) ???Is health related quality of life worse in communities chronically exposed to aircraft noise than in communities not exposed????; and (2) ???Does long-term aircraft noise exposure associate with adult high blood pressure level via noise stress as a mediating factor????. The Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport has been selected as a case study. The health survey instruments have been developed and piloted, and then translated from English into Greek and Arabic. A postal self-administrative health survey (with follow-up letters) has been implemented in the areas surrounding Sydney Airport (called ???aircraft noise exposure group???) and in the matched control group. The total sample size was 1,500 with 47% response rate. This thesis has developed a ???new??? noise index (named Noise Gap Index, NGI) to describe and assess aircraft noise in such a way that is easily understood by the layperson. Factorial analysis of covariance revealed that ???Health related quality of life, in term of physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health, of community chronically exposed to high aircraft noise level were worse than the matched control area???. Binary logistic regression analysis found that ???Subjects (aged 15 ??? 87) who have been chronically exposed to high aircraft noise level have the odds of 2.61 of having chronic noise stress. In addition person who have chronic noise stress have the odds of 2.74 of having hypertension compared with those without chronic noise stress???. Finally, the robust hypotheses of effects of aircraft noise on community health and well-being for future experimental study were proposed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Aircraft Noise</field><field name="subject">Health Related Quality of Life</field><field name="subject">Hypertension</field><field name="subject">Airport noise</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Sydney</field><field name="subject">Measurement</field><field name="subject">Airplanes</field><field name="subject">Noise</field><field name="subject">Health aspects</field><field name="subject">Public health</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22394</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mechanisms of amelioration of lipid-induced insulin resistance: role of AMP-activated protein kinase</field><field name="creator">Iglesias, Miguel Angel, University of New South Wales / Garvan Institute of Medical Research. Physiology &amp; Pharmacology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Insulin resistance is an early marker of Type II diabetes. Excessive lipid accumulation in muscle and liver leads to insulin resistance, and lowering tissue lipids causes an enhancement of insulin action. The enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is activated when cellular energy levels are compromised, such as during exercise; this enhances fuel oxidation and inhibits energy consuming processes. The hypothesis in this thesis was that activating AMPK in a lipid-induced insulin resistant state leads to tissue lipid reduction and improved insulin sensitivity. Insulin resistant high-fat fed (HF-) rats were administered 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-??-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), a specific AMPK activator. During an euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp performed 24h later, HF-rats showed increased whole body, muscle and liver insulin action, independent of changes in PKB-phosphorylation. The liver had reduced triglycerides, malonyl-CoA and increased IkB-a content. A lowering of muscle malonyl-CoA was consistent with conditions favouring increased lipid utilisation. Normal, chow-fed rats also showed improved insulin action post-AICAR. Further studies showed that basal glucose uptake was not increased 24h after AICAR, suggesting that AMPK activation had caused an increase in insulin sensitivity. Diacylglycerols and triglycerides, but not ceramides, were reduced in the liver of AICAR treated HF-rats, suggesting lipid reduction as a likely mediator of enhanced liver insulin action. These lipid species were not reduced in muscle. AICAR administration to HF-rats lowered plasma glucose and fatty acids (FA) acutely, probably due to increased muscle glucose uptake and FA oxidation. Glycogen was reduced in liver and increased in muscle, suggesting glucose mobilisation from liver to muscle. Adrenergic blockade excluded the sympathetic nervous system in the acute AICAR effects. AMPK was activated in white muscle and liver of HF-rats immediately after AICAR, the same tissues that exhibited later improved insulin sensitivity. Tracer technologies used to investigate glucose and lipid fluxes showed that AMPK activation in white muscle simultaneously increased both glucose and FA uptake and their metabolism, with glucose also being stored as glycogen. The liver showed lower lipid synthesis, consistent with reduced liver lipid accumulation observed 24h post-AICAR. In conclusion, these results suggest that activation of AMPK leads to selective tissue lipid reduction and improved insulin action, and is a potential target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type II diabetes.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">diabetes</field><field name="subject">AMPK</field><field name="subject">AMP-activated protein kinase</field><field name="subject">lipid accumulation</field><field name="subject">liver</field><field name="subject">muscle</field><field name="subject">rats</field><field name="subject">amelioration of insulin resistance</field><field name="subject">euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp</field><field name="subject">in vivo studies</field><field name="subject">physiology</field><field name="subject">syndrome X</field><field name="subject">metabolic syndrome</field><field name="subject">protein kinases</field><field name="subject">lipids</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22391</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Cognates, competition and control in bilingual speech production</field><field name="creator">Bond, Rachel Jacqueline, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">If an individual speaks more than one language, there are always at least two ways of verbalising any thought to be expressed. The bilingual speaker must then have a means of ensuring that their utterances are produced in the desired language. However, prominent models of speech production are based almost exclusively on monolingual considerations and require substantial modification to account for bilingual production. A particularly important feature to be explained is the way bilinguals control the language of speech production: for instance, preventing interference from the unintended language, and switching from one language to another. One recent model draws a parallel between bilinguals??? control of their linguistic system and the control of cognitive tasks more generally. The first two experiments reported in this thesis explore the validity of this model by comparing bilingual language switching with a monolingual switching task, as well as to the broader task-switching literature. Switch costs did not conform to the predictions of the task-set inhibition hypothesis in either experiment, as the ???paradoxical??? asymmetry of switch costs was not replicated and some conditions showed benefits, rather than costs, for switching between languages or tasks. Further experiments combined picture naming with negative priming and semantic competitor priming paradigms to examine the role of inhibitory and competitive processes in bilingual lexical selection. Each experiment was also conducted in a parallel monolingual version. Very little negative priming was evident when speaking the second language, but the effects of interlingual cognate status were pronounced. There were some indications of cross-language competition at the level of lexical selection: participants appeared unable to suppress the irrelevant language, even when doing so would make the task easier. Across all the experiments, there was no evidence for global inhibition of the language-not-in-use during speech production. Overall results were characterised by a remarkable flexibility in the mechanisms of bilingual control. A striking dissociation emerged between the patterns of results for cognate and non-cognate items, which was reflected throughout the series of experiments and implicates qualitative differences in the way these lexical items are represented and interconnected.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bilingualism</field><field name="subject">speech production</field><field name="subject">lexical access</field><field name="subject">cognate words</field><field name="subject">speech</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22397</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Preclinical and phase I studies of phenoxodiol: a translational approach for the development of a novel isoflavone for the treatment of prostate cancer</field><field name="creator">de Souza, Paul Linus, Clinical School - St George Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This work presents an investigation of the potential development of phenoxodiol, a novel isoflavone, for the treatment of prostate cancer. The literature concerning isoflavone epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical use and their effect on prostate cancer is reviewed. Isoflavone impact on signal transduction pathways is also reviewed with a particular focus on the Akt / mTOR signal transduction pathway, a key signaling pathway in prostate cancer cells. In vitro experiments and xenograft nude mice studies show that phenoxodiol inhibits the growth of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells, when used alone and in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin. Phenoxodiol in combination with cisplatin is highly synergistic when inhibiting the growth of DU145 cells in particular. We show for the first time, that phenoxodiol and cisplatin or carboplatin, inhibits phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR in DU145 and PC3 cells. A first-in-human study of single dose phenoxodiol investigating its pharmacokinetic properties in cancer patient volunteers was performed. Extensive conjugation of phenoxodiol and a short half-life was noted in this study. A Phase I study of intravenous phenoxodiol administered weekly to patients with advanced cancer was then performed to assess toxicity of a repeated dose schedule, as well as the maximum tolerated dose. This schedule was well tolerated in patients, with lymphocytopenia noted as the main toxicity. Given the short half-life of phenoxodiol and our preclinical studies suggesting that combination with cisplatin and carboplatin synergistically inhibited prostate cancer cell growth, we also undertook a Phase I dose escalation study of oral phenoxodiol administered in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin to patients with advanced cancer. The main adverse events include hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, mild transaminase rises, as well as nausea, constipation, infusion site reactions and lethargy. Three patients with ovarian cancer responded to treatment according to CA125 criteria, and there was a 45% reduction in prostate specific antigen level in one man with androgen independent prostate cancer. The bioavailability of the oral formulation of phenoxodiol was calculated to be 17.5%. Phenoxodiol shows promise for further development in the potential treatment of prostate cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Synergy</field><field name="subject">Prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">Isoflavones</field><field name="subject">Translational research</field><field name="subject">Phase I studies</field><field name="subject">Pharmacokinetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44510</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic art and recombinants: introns non-code and the proto-animate condition</field><field name="creator">Brodyk, Andr??, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines how a contemporary biological model namely genetic recombinant DNA and technologies can be interpreted to develop new creative art-based recombinant processes and media.  This question is investigated through a focus on practice-led research, on materiality and novel methodologies. The materiality centers on the development of new biologically based Genetic art media. These new methodologies entail practice-based interpretations and experimentation of literal and invented molecular recombinant DNA processes. These procedures necessitated working inside molecular biology laboratories as art studios. The idiosyncratic and problematical dimensions of working within a science domain as part of this practical paradigm are presented to contextualize the work relative to more conventional approaches.  The conceptual basis of the project is shown to emanate out of the practice. This experiential strategy was part of the overall approach adopted for this project. Accordingly that underpins the practice as research and also forms the general structure for the written chapters.  Conceptually, the broader results were the development of two main concepts for Genetic art. These are shown to be a direct consequence of a shift in the material nature of the project&#146;s mature phases of practice. These concepts are the Genetic Portmanteaux and the concept of the Protoanimate Condition. They entail reinterpretations of recombinant semi ready-mades and the notion of the inanimate applied to non-coding DNA.  This is important in relation to extant and novel DNA code scripts, especially regarding a particular form of biological inanimate material, the noncoding DNA known as introns. In the Proto-animate Condition argument, introns represent a recondite and temporal state in a pending or protoanimated condition within a recombinant environment.  The major results and conclusions expressed in creative terms are the development of several novel DNA scripts and the practical materialization of these recombinants via the agency of installation. Seven exhibitions including five installations were created and published within curated forums. Overall they imbue qualities such as the temporal, the recondite, the anticipatory and the creative recombinant complexion of DNA material. This is proffered as a fecund area for new art-based explorations and critiques of developments in both contemporary art and science.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44087</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An assessment of recent changes in catchment sediment sources and sinks, central Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Hughes, Andrew Owen, Physical, Environmental &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spatial and temporal information on catchment sediment sources and sinks can provide an improved understanding of catchment response to human-induced disturbances.  This is essential for the implementation of well-targeted catchment-management decisions.  This thesis investigates the nature and timing of catchment response to human activities by examining changes in sediment sources and sinks in a dry-tropical subcatchment of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) catchment area, in northeastern Australia. Changes in catchment sediment sources, both in terms of spatial provenance and erosion type, are determined using sediment tracing techniques.  Results indicate that changes in sediment source contributions over the last 250 years can be linked directly to changes in catchment land use.  Sheetwash and rill erosion from cultivated land (40???60%) and channel erosion from grazed areas (30-80%) currently contribute most sediment to the river system.  Channel erosion, on a basin-wide scale, appears to be more important than previously considered in this region of Australia. Optically stimulated luminescence and 137Cs dating are used to determine pre-and post- European settlement (ca. 1850) alluvial sedimentation rates.  The limitations of using 137Cs as a floodplain sediment dating tool in a low fallout environment, dominated by sediment derived from channel and cultivation sources, are identified.  Low magnitude increases in post-disturbance floodplain sedimentation rates (3 to 4 times) are attributed to the naturally high sediment loads in the dry-tropics.  These low increases suggest that previous predictions which reflect order of magnitude increases in post-disturbance sediment yields are likely to be overestimates. In-channel bench deposits, formed since European settlement, are common features that appear to be important stores of recently eroded material. The spatially distributed erosion/sediment yield model SedNet is applied, both with generic input parameters and locally-derived data.  Outputs are evaluated against available empirically-derived data.  The results suggest that previous model estimates using generic input parameters overestimate post-disturbance and underestimate pre-disturbance sediment yields, exaggerating the impact of European catchment disturbance.  This is likely to have important implications for both local-scale and catchment-wide management scenarios in the GBR region.  Suggestions for future study and the collection of important empirical data to enable more accurate model performance are made.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">137Cs depth profile</field><field name="subject">Human impact</field><field name="subject">Sediment source tracing</field><field name="subject">Floodplain sedimentation</field><field name="subject">Optical dating</field><field name="subject">Great Barrier Reef</field><field name="subject">SedNet</field><field name="subject">Model validation</field><field name="subject">Sediment yield</field><field name="subject">Total 137Cs inventory</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44093</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of super resolution techniques for finer scale remote sensing image mapping</field><field name="creator">Li, Feng, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, methods for achieving  finer scale multi-spectral classification through the  use of super resolution (SR) techniques are investigated. A new super resolution algorithm  Maximum a Posteriori based on the universal hidden Markov tree model (MAP-uHMT) is  developed which can be applied successfully to super-resolve each multi-spectral channel  before classification by standard methods. It is believed that this is the  first time that a true  super resolution algorithm has been applied to multi-spectral classification, and results are  shown to be excellent.  Image registration is an important step for SR in which misalignment can be measured  for each of many low resolution images; therefore, a new and computationally efficient image  registration is developed for this particular application. This improved elastic image  registration method can deal with a global affine warping and local shift translations based  on coarse to  fine pyramid levels. The experimental results show that it can provide good  registration accuracy in less computational time than comparable methods.  Maximum a posteriori (MAP) is adopted to deal with the ill-conditioned problem of super  resolution, wherein a prior is constructed based on the universal hidden Markov tree (uHMT)  model in the wavelet domain. In order to test this prior for MAP estimation, it is first  tested in the simpler and typically ill-conditioned problem of image denoising. Experimental  results illustrate that this new image denoising method achieves good performance for the  test images.  The new prior is then extended to SR. By combining with the new elastic image registration  algorithm, MAP-uHMT can super resolve both some natural video frames and remote  sensing images. Test results with both synthetic data and real data show that this method  achieves super resolution both visually and quantitatively. In order to show that MAPuHMT  is also applicable more widely, it is tested on a sequence of long-range surveillance  images captured under conditions of atmospheric turbulence distortion. The results suggest  that super resolution may have been achieved in this application also.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Resolution (Optics)</field><field name="subject">Image processing : mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Hidden Markov models</field><field name="subject">Remote sensing : mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Digital mapping</field><field name="subject">Algorithms</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44098</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of heteroblasty in Acacia</field><field name="creator">Forster, Michael Anthony, Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Heteroblasty defines a dramatic change in leaf form and function along a shoot and is a prominent feature of the genus Acacia (Mimosaceae). Function of different leaf types in Acacia (i.e. compound leaf versus phyllode) is well established yet it is unknown whether heteroblasty is a plastic trait. A fully factorial designed experiment established the light environment, and not nutrients or water, had a significant influence on heteroblastic development. Compound leaves, which have higher specific leaf area (SLA), are retained for longer under low irradiance and, specifically, under a low Red:Far Red light environment. Plants grown in high intraspecific density environments also retained compound leaves for longer. Blue light signals and greater ultraviolet radiation had no effect on heteroblastic development. Heteroblasty is thought to aid in seedling establishment however across all experiments there was no consistent evidence of improved plant performance. Rather, there was an optimal allocation of biomass to organs where resources were most limiting and this was more influential in assisting seedling establishment. Lastly, a meta-analysis of a global dataset of leaf traits found compound leaves to be similar to simple leaves but offset towards the cheap to construct with fast returns region of the leaf economics spectrum.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Phyllode</field><field name="subject">Light environment</field><field name="subject">Heterophylly</field><field name="subject">Compound leaves</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44100</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Electro-osmotic stabilisation of soft soils : a numerical approach</field><field name="creator">Jeyakanthan, Velautham, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">A numerical formulation for two-dimensional electro-osmotic consolidation in soft clays was derived from the basic equations of fluid flow, current flow and virtual work law. And, a well known elasto-plastic soil model, Modified Cam Clay was embedded into the formulation and implemented into the finite element program AFENA. The formulation was evaluated by comparing the predicted settlement and pore water pressure response with the values obtained from laboratory tests. The tests were conducted in an electro-osmotic triaxial apparatus, which was modified from a standard triaxial apparatus to facilitate electro-osmotic consolidation and required measurements. A series of electro-osmotic consolidation tests under different initial stress conditions were conducted to evaluate the finite element model and very good agreements between the observed and predicted results were observed. Another set of electro-osmotic tests were conducted with the similar initial stress, but different boundary conditions to examine the effects of electrochemical changes during the electro-osmosis. The study showed an apparent increase in the preconsolidation pressure and alteration in the coefficient of consolidation as a result of the electrochemical changes. A one-dimensional electro-osmotic consolidation problem was simulated and analysed, and the settlement and pore water pressure responses were compared with the solutions obtained from Esrig's (1968) one-dimensional theory. Another problem involving combined electro-osmotic and direct loading consolidation was also analysed and the results were compared with the solutions obtained from Wan and Mitchell's (1976) theory. Excellent matches were observed in both cases mentioned above for constant values of electro-osmotic and hydraulic permeabilities. However, the effects of varying electro-osmotic and hydraulic permeabilities, which are practically far more significant and not adopted in the theories mentioned above, were also analysed and the results presented. An attempt was made to simulate and analyse one of the successful field trial of electro-osmotic stabilisation conducted by Bjerrum et al (1967) on Norwegian quick clay. Good agreement between the predicted and reported settlement was observed for the first 50days of the treatment period. However, the model over-predicted the settlement after this period and the possible causes for this variation are discussed.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Modified Cam Clay</field><field name="subject">Soft soil consolidation : testing</field><field name="subject">Soft soil stabilisation : testing</field><field name="subject">AFENA</field><field name="subject">Electro-osmotic consolidation</field><field name="subject">Finite element model</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44101</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Codex : code X : a palimpsest reading of the book as a material object in a new media age</field><field name="creator">Lee, Penelope, School of Design, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research investigates the effects of new media technologies on the architecture of the book in the context of a New Media Age.

The design of the research includes historical and theoretical analysis, case studies of selected contemporary book objects and a series of studio investigations into the space, form, techniques, processes and materials of traditional and contemporary book construction. The theories and design practices of William Morris, implemented in the studio investigations, included researching the origins of book production in the fifteenth century and the traditional hand technologies of papermaking, printmaking and bookbinding. New media investigations included experimental work with laser etching and the embedding of printed, paper pages in porcelain.

It is associated with much harm, including the transmission of blood-borne bacterial and viral infections, self-harm, traumatic injury and drug overdose. All of these harms carry a risk of death, and accordingly, mortality rates in opioid-dependent people are many times higher than those in the general population of the same age and sex. One of the more commonly used strategies for reducing the risks of opioid dependence is the provision of maintenance treatment. In Australia, available maintenance treatments include methadone, buprenorphine, oral naltrexone, and the unregistered sustained-release formulation of naltrexone, naltrexone implants. This thesis reports on a range of data collections and study designs to investigate the levels, predictors and causes of mortality in opioid-dependent persons entering methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance treatment in Australia. The studies used data linkage to examine mortality rates and causes of death in a longitudinal cohort of the early entrants to the NSW methadone program, examined the predictors of mortality (particularly the impact of methadone and buprenorphine treatment) using survival analysis in a longitudinal cohort study, compared national mortality rates between methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone maintenance treatments in a cross-sectional analytic study, and used a small case series of coronial cases to examine whether death from opioid overdose was possible in a recipient of a naltrexone implant. This thesis demonstrates that mortality rates as a whole and from particular causes of death are many times higher in Australian opioid-dependent subjects than the general population, exposure to methadone or buprenorphine maintenance treatment significantly reduced mortality in a sample of opioid-dependent subjects, naltrexone treatment appears to have higher mortality than both methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments, and fatal opioid overdose while in receipt of sustained-release naltrexone treatment is possible. These results support longer retention in and repeated access to methadone and buprenorphine maintenance treatments in order to reduce mortality in opioid-dependent people, and greater regulation of the access to and more rigorous monitoring of the mortality associated with oral and sustained-release naltrexone maintenance treatments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Maintenance treatment</field><field name="subject">Opioid dependence</field><field name="subject">Mortality</field><field name="subject">Methadone</field><field name="subject">Buprenorphine</field><field name="subject">Naltrexone</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Impact of steel ductility on the structural behaviour and strength of RC slabs</field><field name="creator">Sakka, Zafer, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the effects of reinforcement ductility on the strength and ductility of reinforced concrete slabs.

The model is described and shown to accurately simulate the collapse load behaviour of reinforced concrete slabs containing reinforcement of any ductility class, including Class L welded wire fabric. Parametric studies using the numerical model to assess the effects of reinforcement ductility on structural behaviour are also presented and recommendations are made on the minimum reinforcement ductility levels appropriate for use in suspended slabs. The experimental and numerical tests investigated slabs with different types of boundary conditions (simply supported and continuous one-way slabs, corner-supported single panel two slabs and edge-supported two-way slabs), support settlement, steel reinforcement ratio, steel uniform elongation (&#61541;su), steel ultimate to yield stress ratio (fsu/fsy) and rectangularity aspect ratio in the two-way slabs. In total, thirty one slabs were tested. The one-way slabs included four simply supported slabs, seven continuous slabs, and five continuous slabs with support settlement. The two-way slabs included eleven square and rectangular corner-supported slabs and four rectangular edge-supported slabs.

Single phase specimens were prepared in an argon arc furnace and characterised  using x-ray powder diffraction, specific heat and magnetic measurements.  For the RT2Si2 series previous investigations were extended to include T = Mn  and Cr whose sub-lattices are antiferromagnetic well above room temperature. However,  the rare earth sub-lattices were confirmed to order close to liquid helium temperature.  With the assistance of the lattice electric field gradient (EFG) for isostructural GdCr2Si2  (determined elsewhere using 155Gd-Mo??ssbauer spectroscopy) and the within-rank CF  parameter ratios for HoCr2Si2 (determined elsewhere using INS), the experimental 169Tm  quadrupole interaction data were analysed to arrive at CF parameters for the Tm3+ site in  TmCr2Si2. The final CF parameters match well with the trend observed for other  members of the series RT2Si2 (T = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu). CF schemes were also determined for  Tm3+ in TmMn2Si2 and Er3+ in both ErCr2Si2 and ErMn2Si2.  For the RNiAl4 series, TmNiAl4 was determined to be antiferromagnetic below TN  = 4.7 K with the 169Tm-Mo??ssbauer spectra retaining a magnetic appearance up to 80 K  due to the effect of slow spin-lattice relaxation. The relaxation data are consistent with a  well-isolated ground state doublet (or pseudo-doublet) whose eigenfunctions have high  components of mJ = ??6 states and with the relaxation proceeding via an excited state at  350 K. Because of the relaxation effect, the 169Tm-Mo??ssbauer data could not be  interpreted in terms of CF parameters in the usual way. Instead, the INS spectra recorded  for ErNiAl4 were analysed using a novel semi-empirical approach that coupled rank 2 CF  parameters converted from the EFG tensor for isostructural GdCr2Si2 (determined  elsewhere using 155Gd-Mo??ssbauer spectroscopy) with simple point-charge model  calculations of the rank 4 and 6 within-rank CF parameter ratios. The first full set of CF  parameters for this series was then determined for the Er3+ site in ErNiAl4.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Rare earth sub-lattices</field><field name="subject">Rare earths</field><field name="subject">Crystal field interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44105</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Aspects of reductive methods in organophosphorus chemistry</field><field name="creator">Donoghue, Neil, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study is concerned with the reductive cleavage of tetracoordinated organophos-phorus compounds (either quaternary phosphonium salts R4P+ X??? or tertiary phosphine oxides R3P=O) with either the naphthalene radical (naphthalenide) anion or lithium aluminium hy-dride in THF solution at room temperature (RT). Part 1 examines the reaction of lithium naphthalenide with both phosphonium salts and phosphine oxides. The reaction was dem-onstrated to cleave phenyl groups from both bis-salts and bis-oxides in the presence of 1,2-ethylene bridges; based upon this, parallel syntheses of either 1,4-diphosphabicyclo[2.2.2]oc-tane or its P,P'-dioxide were attempted by using the commercially available ethane-1,2-bis-(diphenylphosphine) as the starting material in each case. Examination of the products ofreductive cleavage of the series of benzylphenylphosphonium bromide [PhnP(CH2Ph)4-n]+ Br???(where n = 0 to 3) with lithium naphthalenide leads to the proposal of a mechanism. Part 2 describes hydridic reductions of both quaternary phosphonium salts and ter-tiary phosphine oxides. Examination of the lithium aluminium hydride reduction of qua-ternary phosphonium salts using 31P-NMR has confirmed tetraorganophosphoranes (R4PH; R = Ph, alkyl) as intermediates in the reaction; in addition, two previously unknown classes of compounds, the triorganophosphoranes R3PH2 and the tetraorganophosphoranates R4PH2???, were also found to be intermediates. The behaviour of bis-phosphonium salts where the phosphonium centres are separated by either 1,2-ethylene or 1,3-propylene bridges are also examined. Formation of a monocation exhibiting a bridging hydride occurs when the cyclic bis-phosphonium salt 1,1,5,5-tetraphenyl-1,5-diphosphocanium dibromide is reacted with li-thium aluminium hydride. Mechanisms are proposed which are consistent with the observed experimental results.</field><field name="date">1998</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Organophosphorus compounds -- Analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22405</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Calculation of the effective permeability and simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs</field><field name="creator">Teimoori Sangani, Ahmad, Petroleum Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is aimed to calculate the effective permeability tensor and to simulate the fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs. This requires an understanding of the mechanisms of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs and the detailed properties of individual fractures and matrix porous media. This study has been carried out to address the issues and difficulties faced by previous methods; to establish possible answers to minimise the difficulties; and hence, to improve the efficiency of reservoir simulation through the use of properties of individual fractures. The methodology used in this study combines several mathematical and numerical techniques like the boundary element method, periodic boundary conditions, and the control volume mixed finite element method. This study has contributed to knowledge in the calculation of the effective permeability and simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs through the development of two algorithms. The first algorithm calculates the effective permeability tensor by use of properties of arbitrary oriented fractures (location, size and orientation). It includes all multi-scaled fractures and considers the appropriate method of analysis for each type of fracture (short, medium and long). In this study a characterisation module which provides the detail information for individual fractures is incorporated. The effective permeability algorithm accounts for fluid flows in the matrix, between the matrix and the fracture and disconnected fractures on effective permeability. It also accounts for the properties of individual fractures in calculation of the effective permeability tensor. The second algorithm simulates flow of single-phase fluid in naturally fractured reservoirs by use of the effective permeability tensor. This algorithm takes full advantage of the control volume discretisation technique and the mixed finite element method in calculation of pressure and fluid flow velocity in each grid block. It accounts for the continuity of flux between the neighbouring blocks and has the advantage of calculation of fluid velocity and pressure, directly from a system of first order equations (Darcy???s law and conservation of mass???s law). The application of the effective permeability tensor in the second algorithm allows us the simulation of fluid flow in naturally fractured reservoirs with large number of multi-scale fractures. The fluid pressure and velocity distributions obtained from this study are important and can considered for further studies in hydraulic fracturing and production optimization of NFRs.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">effective permeability</field><field name="subject">fluid flow</field><field name="subject">naturally fractured reservoirs</field><field name="subject">rocks</field><field name="subject">fluid dynamics</field><field name="subject">hydrocarbon reservoirs</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22408</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of synthetic approaches towards molecules with potential SERM activity</field><field name="creator">Da Silva, Paulo Alexandre Reis, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The primary aim of this project was to develop organometallic methodologies for the conversion of aryl benzyl ketones into aryl- and/or aroyl- substituted stilbenes related to Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs): Tamoxifen and Raloxifene, respectively. Consideration was given to target molecules that were acyclic, cyclic or heterocyclic. A secondary aim of the project was to develop methodologies that would allow combinatorial methods to be applied to the synthesis of these compounds, allowing quick access to a diverse range of SERM-candidate libraries of compounds. Primary methodologies that were examined included: Grignard, organocerium, and palladium-catalysed Negishi, Stille and Suzuki cross-coupling reactions. In addition, the rearrangement reaction of epoxides and nucleophilic ring opening of epoxides were explored as secondary means of new C-C bond construction. It was found the Grignard chemistry demanded the application of heat and suffered greatly from competing deprotonation reactions of the ketones due to the basicity of the organomagnesium reagents. The corresponding, less basic, organocerium reagents also gave low yields (0-11%). While these methodologies demonstrated some advantages, such as the direct addition of the nucleophilic components to the carbonyl groups of model ketones, they demonstrated some limitations, which were poor yields and restriction to using only carbonyl containing starting materials. Palladium-catalysed Negishi cross-coupling methodology was reliable in C-C bond formation but gave only moderate yields of isolated products. Stille reagents gave crosscoupled products readily and in high yields with sterically unhindered reactants, such as the enol triflate of ??- tetralone. However, they did not readily cross-couple with the corresponding ??-enol triflate and ??-vinyl bromide reactants. This became an insurmountable barrier to their widespread use in SERM synthesis but did provide a sequence with selectivity. The Suzuki methodology was discovered to be superior to other methods of cross-coupling and the most reliable in furnishing both ??- and ??-coupled products in high yields. The yield of the palladium-catalysed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction at the ??-position was found to follow the following order of reactivity: I &amp;gt Br &amp;gt OTf, in keeping with literature precedent, while the stability of the palladium-catalyst, and the choices of base and solvent affected the outcome of the reaction. The Suzuki reaction was also employed in a three-component carbonylative reaction to furnish unsymmetrical ketones, in model reactions towards Raloxifene-like structures, but the products were obtained in low to moderate yields. Initial investigations into the synthesis of closer model compounds through two-fold Suzuki cross-coupling reactions were limited by access to suitable precursors and this indicated a direction for future research.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogens</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of client perceived value for professional B2B services in an international context</field><field name="creator">La, Vinh Quang, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In today???s highly competitive business environment, client perceived value has become increasingly important to practitioners and business researchers as it is believed to be central to client decision-making, satisfaction and client retention. However, there are few insights as to what constitutes client perceived value and what are its antecedents, especially in the context of international, professional business-to-business (B2B) services. This study thus addressed two key questions: (i) what are the antecedents of client perceived value in an international, professional B2B service setting?; and (ii) how do these determinants influence client perceived performance and value under different contingency conditions (e.g., perceptions of country-oforigin (COO) and client experience)? The research was undertaken in two phases: Phase 1 included a literature review covering services marketing, international marketing, resource-based theory, contingency theory as well as an exploratory research amongst eight dyadic case studies. The objectives were to identify the key variables that contribute to client perceived performance and value; to fine tune the key constructs adopted from the literature; and to verify the linkage between the resource-based view (RBV) of a firm and client perceived value. By drawing on the theories mentioned above, and the results from the exploratory research, a conceptual model and a series of hypotheses were developed. The data used to test the model in Phase 2 was collected from 218 client firms in both Malaysia and Thailand. The data was collected through a mail survey with a net response rate of 32.9%, and was analysed via structural equation modelling, regression analysis and subgroup analysis. The results show that the key antecedents of perceived performance which in turn drives client value, included technical skills, customer orientation, innovation and firm reputation. The findings also suggest that COO moderates the relationships between these antecedents and perceived performance, while client experience moderates the association between perceived performance and value. The results provide a better understanding of value perceived by the B2B clients in an international setting. The academic contributions of this thesis are: the linkage of RBV and the services paradigm in an international context; the understanding of client perceived value and its antecedents; and the establishment of metric equivalence of measures employed across two countries (Malaysia and Thailand). Finally, the managerial contributions include guidance for exporting firms in terms of resource allocation to achieve competitive advantage; utilising the COO effect in promotion; and managing client value perceptions in international markets.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">international business enterprises</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22426</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic analysis and robust design of stiffened composite structures</field><field name="creator">Lee, Merrill Cheng Wei, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The European Commission 6th Framework Project COCOMAT (Improved MATerial Exploitation at Safe Design of COmposite Airframe Structures by Accurate Simulation of COllapse) was a four and a half year project (2004 to mid-2008) aimed at exploiting the large reserve of strength in composite structures through more accurate prediction of collapse. In the experimental work packages, significant statistical variation in buckling behaviour and ultimate loading were encountered. The variations observed in the experimental results were not predicted in the finite element analyses that were done in the early stages of the project.  The work undertaken in this thesis to support the COCOMAT project was initiated when it was recognised that there was a gap in knowledge about the effect of initial defects and variations in the input variables of both the experimental and simulated panels. The work involved the development of stochastic algorithms to relate variations in boundary conditions, material properties and geometries to the variation in buckling modes and loads up to first failure. It was proposed in this thesis that any future design had to focus on the dominant parameters affecting the statistical scatter in the results to achieve lower sensitivity to variation. A methodology was developed for designing stiffened composite panels with improved robustness. Several panels tested in the COCOMAT project were redesigned using this approach to demonstrate its applicability.  The original contributions from this thesis are therefore the development of a stochastic methodology to identify the impact of variation in input parameters on the response of stiffened composite panels and the development of Robust Indices to support the design of new panels. The stochastic analysis included the generation of metamodels that allow quantification of the impact that the inputs have on the response using two first order variables, Influence and Sensitivity. These variables are then used to derive the Robust Indices. A significant outcome of this thesis was the recognition in the final report for COCOMAT that the development of a validated robust index should be a focus of any future design of postbuckling stiffened panels.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Collapse</field><field name="subject">COCOMAT</field><field name="subject">Stiffened Composite Structures</field><field name="subject">Uncertainty</field><field name="subject">Robust Design</field><field name="subject">Postbuckling and Collapse</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44217</field></doc><doc><field name="title">What brand &lt;are you?&gt; : reconnoitering happiness</field><field name="creator">Bodzick, Marlo, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Today desires are often confused with needs.

By using this fast paced digital aesthetic based in motion-graphics, coupled with split as well as multiple screens, I reference the hyper-reality created by advertising and bestowed upon brands.   In my video I raise, and sometimes provoke, questions such as: What is our 'brand' as people? Are we too, objects that can and should be branded? How do we feel about that?   Why do we attach ourselves so strongly to certain things or brands? Do we believe it will make us happy? Where does happiness exist for us?

Glass as supporting material significantly complicates the fabrication process as it limits the thermal budget and the maximum temperature. In this work, the feasibility of forming large-grained pc-Si thin-film solar cells on glass by ion-assisted deposition (IAD) on aluminium-induced crystallisation (AIC) seed layers (ALICIA solar cells) is investigated. IAD allows epitaxial growth at high rate, and being based on evaporation, is of low cost (high source material usage, no toxic gases involved). High-quality epitaxy on (100)-oriented Si wafer substrates is demonstrated in a non{UHV environment, to further increase its industrial appli- cability. High{rate growth and a sacrificial protective layer control contamination problems associated with the non-UHV environment. The process is then trans- ferred to AIC-seeded glass and optimised, with particular focus on the influence of the glass. Using high-temperature rapid thermal annealing and hydrogenation as post-deposition treatments, ALICIA solar cells with a 1-Sun open-circuit voltage of 420 mV are achieved. Moreover, two novel characterisation techniques are presented. One allows the fast and non-destructive assessment of the structural quality of pc-Si films using opti- cal measurements. Furthermore, `impedance analysis', a novel capacitance-voltage measurement technique based on impedance spectroscopy, is presented. It allows the reliable determination of the absorber layer doping density and the built{in potential of non-ideal p-n junction solar cells. The latter is used to investigate the influence of post{deposition treatments on the n-type absorber layer doping of ALICIA solar cells. It is found, using temperature dependent impedance analysis, that unintentional doping and defects have a strong influence on the absorber layer doping. A maximum in the short-circuit current density of ALICIA solar cells is found for phosphorus concentrations in the absorber of 1??1017 cm??3. For such ALI- CIA cells a base difusion length in the range 600 - 950nm, a short{circuit current density in the range 10 - 13.5 mA/cm2 and an energy conversion efficiency of 2.2% are obtained.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">thin films</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22435</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Age related variations in anterior ocular characteristics and response to short term contact lens wear</field><field name="creator">Jayakumar, Jaikishan, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis was to investigate age related variations in anterior ocular characteristics and their effect on the response to short-term (one-hour) open eye orthokeratology (OK) lens wear and overnight hydrogel lens wear. Sixty-three volunteer subjects were divided into three groups comprising children (Group I), young adults (Group II) and older adults (Group III). Anterior ocular characteristics that were measured included corneal topography with the Medmont corneal topographer, total, stromal and epithelial thickness with the Holden-Payor optical pachometer, microscopic cell characteristics with the confocal microscope, corneal aesthesiometry, corneal modulus of elasticity, and tear film, palpebral and eyelid characteristics. The older cornea was found to be more spherical in shape (asphericity Q = -0.24 ?? 0.07 in group III compared to -0.34 ?? 0.09 and -0.32 ?? 0.17 in groups I and II respectively) and showed a tendency from with-the-rule to against-the-rule astigmatism. Older subjects also had a decreased endothelial cell density (2596 ?? 111 cells/mm2 in group III compared to 2793 ?? 138 cells/mm2 in group II) and reduced eyelid tension compared to the younger groups. Children were found to have lower blink rates than adults. It was concluded that these changes might have a significant impact on contact lens wear. The responses to two contact lens based techniques, orthokeratology (OK) and hydrogel overnight wear (ON), were studied. Sixty subjects (20 per group) wore reverse-geometry lenses (BE, Ultravison Aust Pty Ltd) of Boston XO material in one eye under open eye conditions for one hour in one eye only. Changes in unaided visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness and confocal microscopic variables were measured after OK lens wear. All subject groups showed statistically significant improvements (p &amp;lt 0.05) in unaided visual acuity, a trend for more positive (less prolate) corneal asphericity, increase in apical corneal radius and decrease in central total corneal thickness, after OK lens wear. When the groups were stratified, statistical significance was obtained between the older group and the other two younger groups for change in apical corneal radius (0.23 ?? 0.01 mm in group I, 0.15 ?? 0.01 mm for group II, 0.06 ?? 0.33 for group III). The change in asphericity also showed significant differences between the older age group (0.10 ?? 0.08 mm) and the young adult group (0.21 ?? 0.13). Central corneal thinning obtained after one hour of OK lens wear revealed significant differences between the older adult group (-1.9 ?? 3.2 ??m) and the other two groups (-5.0 ?? 5.9 ??m in group I, -5.0 ?? 2.0 ??m for group II). Sixty subjects wore hydrogel lenses (One-Day Acuvue, Johnson and Johnson Visioncare Pty Ltd) made of etafilcon A in one eye only overnight during sleep at their home. Changes in unaided visual acuity, corneal curvature, corneal thickness, confocal microscopic variables and slitlamp variables were measured after ON lens wear. All subjects showed significant thickening (p &amp;lt 0.05) of the cornea with ON wear, more in the lens-wearing eye. This study reported that the edema response induced by Acuvue contact lenses is stromal in origin. The edema response of the older group (33.9 ?? 11.5 ??m) was lower than the other two groups as demonstrated by the difference in the change in central stromal thickness (49.3 ?? 20.3 ??m for group I and 51.0 ?? 20.0 ??m for group II). However, a statistically significant difference in the change in thickness was not reached either for the central total corneal thickness or for other topographic locations. Corneal and visual changes found in this study confirm previous reports of the effects of short term OK and hydrogel ON lens wear. Older lens wearers showed a reduced or delayed response to short-term lens wear. Studies investigating the effects of age with long lens-wearing durations are warranted to quantify these effects further.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Contact lenses; Orthokeratology.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22443</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The balance of power in Second World War Australia :the deliberative role of Coles and Wilson in the House of Representatives from 1940</field><field name="creator">Hayman, Christopher Charles Douglas, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The problem being investigated is the historical situation relating to two independent MPs holding the balance of power in the Australian House of Representatives in 1940 and 1941. The two MPs, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson, supported the conservative Menzies and Fadden governments before shifting their support (on October 3 1941) to the Labor Party led by Curtin. The procedure followed is the examination, in the form of a historical narrative, of primary evidence in private papers (such as Coles???s), analysis of Hansard (CPD), local and metropolitan newspapers. Also examined are references to the two independents in secondary literature. The key focus of interest will be the idea that chance or serendipity played a major role in achieving all the key outcomes which many Australians (and historians like Hasluck) often otherwise depict as the triumph of good sense within a supposedly non-problematic twoparty political system which self-selected the best possible leadership during time of war. Coles took over the seat of a popular Cabinet minister who had died in an air disaster. Coles???s and Wilson???s holding the balance of power was another extreme aberration, as no House of Representatives from 1906 to 1940, and none since, has not had either of the two party blocs (Labor and anti-Labor) without a majority. Hasluck, the most influential historian of Australian politics during the 1939-1945 war, viewed the fact of Coles???s and Wilson???s serendipity as evidence, in itself, of their wider historical, ideological and political irrelevance. The general results obtained by pursuing a critical historical narrative approach is that a strong counter-argument has been developed that suggests that Hasluck (and wider historical memory) has insufficiently valued as historical factors Coles???s and Wilson???s ideological aims. Coles was a representative of business progressivism and Wilson of agrarian socialism. The major conclusion reached is that Coles???s and Wilson???s wider aims led them to adopt the tactic of timing their shift to Labor so as to maximize their ideological influence on the Labor administration that would result whenever they decided to exercise their entirely serendipitously attained balance of power.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">politics and government</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22446</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autogenous shrinkage in cementitious systems</field><field name="creator">Rajayogan, Vinod, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Autogenous shrinkage is of concern in high performance concrete mixtures, when  specific properties like strength and durability are enhanced. Factors like low watercement  ratio, low porosity and increased hydration kinetics which are associated with  high performance concrete mixtures are also responsible for the development of  autogenous shrinkage. With about two decades of research into autogenous shrinkage,  uncertainties still exist with testing procedure, effect of supplementary cementitious  materials, modelling and prediction of autogenous shrinkage.  The primary focus of this study is to understand mechanisms which have been  postulated to cause autogenous shrinkage like chemical shrinkage and self desiccation.  In addition, this study has considered properties like porosity and internal empty voids  in the analysis of the causes of bulk volume deformations of the cementitious paste  systems with and without mineral admixtures.  The study begins with an experimental investigation of chemical shrinkage in hydrating  cementitious paste systems with the addition of fly ash, slag and silica fume using the  test method recently accepted by the ASTM. This was followed by the experimental  investigation of autogenous shrinkage in cementitious paste. The autogenous shrinkage  in paste mixtures is studied from an early age (~1.5 hours after addition of water) for  cementitious systems at a water-cementitious ratio of 0.32 (w/c 0.25 for limited mixture  proportions). A non-contact measurement method using eddy current sensors were  adopted. The hydration mechanism of the cementitious paste systems was then  modelled using CEMHYD3D, which is a 3 dimensional numerical modelling method  successfully used to study, simulate and present the hydration developments in  cementitious systems. Properties like chemical shrinkage, degree of hydration, total  porosity and free water content; all of which have been obtained from the CEMHYD3D  simulation have been cross correlated with the experimental results in order to more  comprehensively understand the mechanism contributing to bulk volume change under  sealed conditions. The experimental investigations are extended to study the development in concrete with and without mineral admixtures (i.e., silica fume, fly ash and slag). Self desiccation driving the development of autogenous shrinkage has been used extensively across literature but as an alternative the author has proposed using internal drying factor in modelling autogenous shrinkage. The "internal drying factor" is described as the ratio of the empty voids (due to chemical shrinkage) to the total porosity at any point of time of hydration. Independent of the mixture proportions, a linear trend was observed between the autogenous shrinkage strain and increase in internal drying factor. Thus the internal drying factor could be incorporated into semiempirical models while attempting to predict autogenous shrinkage. An increase in the compressive strength of matured concrete at 1 year had a strong correlation to the observed autogenous shrinkage strains irrespective of the cementitious system. It is believed this could be because of the increase in gel-space ratio which is intern linked to the degree of hydration and porosity of the microstructure. The author has obtained strong evidence that the micro-structural changes associated with high strength and durable concrete have a direct impact on the autogenous shrinkage of concrete. Hence, the author suggests that autogenous shrinkage should be investigated and allowable values be stipulated as design criterion in structures that use high strength-high performance concrete.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cement composites expansion and contraction</field><field name="subject">Concrete expansion and contraction</field><field name="subject">High strength concrete expansion and contraction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44250</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting and preventing the spread of lantana into the Blue Mountains</field><field name="creator">Gold, Daniel Alexander, Biological, Earth &amp;  Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Invasive weeds inflict significant harm on native species, ecosystem processes, and natural disturbance regimes.  When managing these weed threats, some of the most useful tools are the outputs of predictive distribution models.  As they supplement existing distribution data to assess where in the landscape is most susceptible to weed invasion, they allow for more efficient weed management because the areas most suited to weed species may be targeted for control.	This research develops a habitat suitability model for the weed lantana (Lantana camara L. sensu lato) in a portion of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area at present and under forecast warmer climates.  A generalised additive model (GAM) is used, which fits the regression curve used for prediction to the calibration data themselves and allows for an exploration of which environmental conditions favour lantana as well as where in the landscape is most suitable for the weed.  Temperature was positively correlated with suitable habitat and explained over 90% of the variation in lantana presence predicted by the model.  15% of the study area was found to be suitable for lantana at present, with this figure reaching 58% after a simulated 3??C rise in temperature.  Mapping habitat suitability across the study area allowed for the identification of five distinct pathways for lantana to further invade the Blue Mountains.	Responding to calls for the integration of weed management with biodiversity conservation, the research also integrates the habitat suitability model with information regarding the distribution of vegetation communities and endangered species in the Blue Mountains.  Thirteen native vegetation communities were found to have more than 20% suitable habitat for lantana at present, and an additional three contained more than 80% suitable habitat after a simulated 3??C rise in temperature.  Five of these communities are listed as threatened under relevant legislation and harbour at least 27 endangered species, placing additional urgency on their conservation.  	This research has successfully used modelling techniques to identify areas for targeted weed management integrated with biodiversity conservation.  The methods are easily adaptable to other weeds and regions and could thus be used to illustrate the comprehensive threat weeds pose to Australia???s biodiversity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodiversity conservation</field><field name="subject">Weeds</field><field name="subject">Species distribution modelling</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The use of microsatellites as a surrogate for quantitative trait variation in conservation</field><field name="creator">Gunn, Melissa Rose, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conservation biologists are interested in maintaining genetic variation in small populations, with a view to maintaining fitness and the ability of the species to adapt to changing environmental conditions. The most important type of genetic variation is therefore that which affects fitness and reproduction, and is therefore subject to natural selection. Such fitness traits are often quantitative, i.e. are the result of a suite of loci, and are continuously variable. Microsatellite markers are a popular method of determining the level of variation present in a species??? genome. The assumption is made that microsatellites, which are neutral markers, behave in the same manner as quantitative traits. If this assumption were proved incorrect, then the use of neutral markers in conservation monitoring would have to be re-evaluated. In this study, experiments have been conducted using Drosophila melanogaster to test the assumption that variation in quantitative traits under stabilising selection declines at the same rate as heterozygosity in microsatellite markers, during a population bottleneck. Experimental population bottlenecks were of two effective population sizes (Ne), Ne=2 for one generation and Ne=60 for 35 generations. Based on the effective population size, we expected both types of bottlenecks to lose 25% of neutral genetic variation. Ten replicates of each bottleneck were maintained, along with four large control populations with Ne=320. In each population, heterozygosity (He) for eight microsatellite loci was compared with the heritability and additive genetic variance of two quantitative traits subject to balancing selection: fecundity and sternopleural bristle number. Microsatellite heterozygosity decreased in accordance with neutral predictions, whereas additive genetic variation in quantitative traits altered more than expected in both large and in bottlenecked populations relative to the initial sampling values, indicating that variation in quantitative traits was not being lost at the same rate as predicted by neutral theory. For most traits, the changes in additive genetic variance were congruent in all populations, large or bottlenecked. This congruence suggests that a common process was affecting all populations, such as adaptation. A mite infestation in early generations is a possible source of selective pressure. When bottlenecked populations were compared to the contemporaneous large populations (Ne = 320), the additive genetic variance of most traits was seen to have been lost in accordance with predictions from the loss of microsatellite heterozygosity. Loss of variation in microsatellites can thus be used to predict the loss of variation in quantitative traits due to bottlenecks, but not to predict the potentially much larger changes due to other processes such as adaptation. The effects of concurrent environmental stress and reduced population size were also evaluated. Endangered populations are often subject to environmental stress in addition to reduced population size, but the effect of stress on the additive genetic variance of fitness traits in organisms undergoing population bottlenecks is unknown. If the presence of stress alters the level of additive genetic variance in fitness traits, the viability of such populations could be substantially affected. The loss of microsatellite heterozygosity was not affected by the presence of a stress agent during a bottleneck. I found some significant effects of stress on the additive genetic variance of sternopleural bristles and fecundity; there was also a significant interaction between stress and the response to directional selection in sternopleural bristles. There was also an increase in the coefficient of variation of VA for sternopleural bristles. Stress may therefore affect the manner in which populations respond to selective pressures.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">genetic markers; microsatellites (genetics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22457</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The viable governance model (VGM) :  a theoretical model of IT governance with a corporate setting</field><field name="creator">Millar, Gary, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Empirical studies into IT governance have considerably advanced our understanding of  the mechanisms and practices used by contemporary organisations to govern their  current and future use of IT. However, despite the progress made in identifying the  various elements employed by contemporary IT governance arrangements, there has  been relatively little research into the formulation of a holistic model of IT governance  that integrates the growing collection of parts into a coherent whole.  To further advance the concept of IT governance, the Viable Governance Model  (VGM) is proposed. The VGM is a theoretical model of IT governance within a  corporate setting that is based on the laws and principles of cybernetics as embodied in  Stafford Beer's Viable System Model (VSM). Cybernetics, the science of control and  communication in biological and artificial systems, establishes a firm theoretical  foundation upon which to design a system that directs and controls the IT function in a  complex enterprise.  The VGM is developed using an approach based on design science. Given the  theoretical nature of the artefact that is being designed, the development and evaluation  activities are primarily conceptual in nature. That is, the development activity involves  the design of a theoretical model of IT governance using theoretical concepts and  constructs drawn from several reference disciplines including cybernetics, organisation  theory, and complexity theory.  The conceptual evaluation of the VGM indicates that the model is sufficiently robust to  incorporate many of the empirical findings arising from academic and professional  research. The resultant model establishes a "blueprint", or set of design principles, that  can be used by IS practitioners to design and implement a system of IT governance that  is appropriate to their organisational contingencies. Novel aspects of this research  include: the integration of corporate and IT governance; the reinterpretation of the role  of the enterprise architecture (EA) within a complex enterprise; the exposition of the  relationship between the corporate and divisional IT groups; and the resolution of the  centralisation versus decentralisation dilemma that confront designers of IT governance  arrangements.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Data protection</field><field name="subject">Information technology : management</field><field name="subject">Corporate governance</field><field name="subject">Business enterprises : computer networks</field><field name="subject">Cybernetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44262</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Finite element study of geosynthetic encased stone columns in sensitive soft clay</field><field name="creator">Zhang, Rongan, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Some normally consolidated soft soils manifest strength sensitivity, ie these soil manifest strain softening when shear in an undrained mode. These soils, referred to as sensitive soft soils, have the typical features of strain hardening in drained shearing and strain softening in undrained shearing. The consolidation lines of these soils are also curved (concave upwards) in the semi-log space. However, under high consolidation stress or upon large shearing, these soils re-gain the features of re-constituted soil. Ground improvement methods like stone columns were reported as not effective when installed in the sensitive soft clays. But mechanism of the un-effectiveness of the stone columns remains unknown because of lack of a suitable and simple model for simulating the stress-strain behaviours of sensitive soft soils. Although these soils have a meta-stable micro-structure, models that developed for simulating structured firm soils are not suitable for simulating sensitive soft soil features. Thus, a new model was formulated. The new model can degenerate back to a Modified Cam Clay model. The ability of new model in simulating a range of behaviour was verified by using the finite difference (FD) method in solving the partial differential equations of the soil model for a range of tri-axial test conditions. The model was further implemented in coupled analysis formulation and coded into FEM program AFENA. Various cases with different soil parameters were then simulated and compared with the FD solutions for various triaxial tests so as to check the stability of the FEM code. The coupled FEA was then used to simulate the performance of geosynthetic-encased stone columns. A new stone column element and a geo-encasement element were developed and coded into AFENA. The stone column simulations were then done for both non-sensitive soils (represented by Modified Cam Clay model) and sensitive soft soil (represented by the new model). Parametric study was conducted to examine the performance of the geo-encased stone columns in both types of soils. Furthermore, two different installation methods: wished-in installation and full displacement installation were studied numerically. Cross comparison was done to investigate how the sensitive soft soil features interact with the installation method in affecting the performance of the geo-encased stone columns. A range of factors that influence the geosynthetic-encased stone columns performance installed in soft soils were also made clear.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soil consolidation</field><field name="subject">Sensitive soft clays</field><field name="subject">Shear strength of soils</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Geo-encased stone columns</field><field name="subject">Soil behaviour : simulation models</field><field name="subject">Finite difference (FD) method</field><field name="subject">Soil stress</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of the effects of distributed structural modification on the dynamic response of structures</field><field name="creator">Hang, Huajiang, Engineering &amp; Information Technology, Australian Defence Force Academy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this study is to investigate means of efficiently assessing the effects of distributed structural modification on the dynamic properties of a complex structure. The helicopter structure is normally designed to avoid resonance at the main rotor rotational frequency. However, very often military helicopters have to be modified (such as to carry a different weapon system or an additional fuel tank) to fulfill operational requirements. Any modification to a helicopter structure has the potential of changing its resonance frequencies and mode shapes. The dynamic properties of the modified structure can be determined by experimental testing or numerical simulation, both of which are complex, expensive and time-consuming.  Assuming that the original dynamic characteristics are already established and that the modification is a relatively simple attachment such as beam or plate modification, the modified dynamic properties may be determined numerically without solving the equations of motion of the full-modified structure. The frequency response functions (FRFs) of the modified structure can be computed by coupling the original FRFs and a delta dynamic stiffness matrix for the modification introduced. The validity of this approach is investigated by applying it to several cases, 1) 1D structure with structural modification but no change in the number of degree of freedom (DOFs). A simply supported beam with double thickness in the middle section is treated as an example for this case; 2) 1D structure with additional DOFs. A cantilever beam to which a smaller beam is attached is treated as an example for this case, 3) 2D structure with a reduction in DOFs. A four-edge-clamped plate with a cut-out in the centre is treated as an example for this case; and 4) 3D structure with additional DOFs. A box frame with a plate attached to it as structural modification with additional DOFs and combination of different structures. The original FRFs were obtained numerically and experimentally except for the first case. The delta dynamic stiffness matrix was determined numerically by modelling the part of the modified structure including the modifying structure and part of the original structure at the same location. The FRFs of the modified structure were then computed. Good agreement is obtained by comparing the results to the FRFs of the modified structure determined experimentally as well as by numerical modelling of the complete modified structure.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Distributed structural modification</field><field name="subject">Structural analysis (Engineering) : mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Frequency response (Dynamics) : mathematical models</field><field name="subject">Complex structures : dynamic properites</field><field name="subject">Frequency response functions : mathematical models</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44275</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Illegal immigration to Singapore</field><field name="creator">Tan, Siew Hoon, History &amp; Philosophy, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Singapore is a country built entirely by migrants. The topic of migration thus forms a very important part of the history of Singapore, in which much research has been done. However, one aspect of the modern migration history of Singapore has not been wellstudied, and that is illegal immigration. Since centuries ago, people have been smuggled on the very waterways that modern Singapore owes its prosperity to. Today, people are still entering and exiting the country clandestinely using the same waterways. However, as technology develops, the methods by which these people use to enter Singapore clandestinely are constantly changing. Regardless of the change in methods, such clandestine migration often involves great danger and hardship for those who dare to embark on the journey, just as the way it was in the past. This is even more so as Singapore turns from a colony to an independent country, and as the independent government increasingly exercises more control on the type of immigrants it allows into its borders to help take the country to greater heights in terms of prosperity. Immigration policies and laws thus become fine-tuned and people who are deemed ??undesirable?? are filtered out. The strict laws did not, however, deter some people from entering the country in search of a good job and a better life. As Singapore gears itself to receive more legal migrants, it must also be prepared to take measures against illegal immigrants. Illegal immigration is therefore a continuous battle between the authorities and the illegal migrants. Through the use of official and unofficial documents and public resources, some of which are not easily obtainable, this thesis traces the development of illegal immigration from a historical context and explores the life of the illegal migrants in Singapore so as to fill in the gaps on an under-studied topic, as well as the change in mindsets migrants-turned-citizens have towards new migrants, in an attempt to use a historical approach to explain the issue of the social phenomenon of illegal migration to Singapore.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Illegal immigration</field><field name="subject">Singapore</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44279</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of low-cost carriers on regional dispersal of domestic visitors in Australia: examinations of the effects on visitors' dispersal sourced from intra-modal and inter-modal differentials</field><field name="creator">Koo, Tay Tae-Ryang, Aviation, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis was conceived in the context of post-2000 proliferation of Australian low-cost carriers and regional dispersal policy of the Australian government. The broad aim of this thesis is to examine the effects of low-cost carriers on regional dispersal of domestic visitors. Based on existing theoretical frameworks of tourists?? spatial behaviour and multi-destination travel itinerary, two theoretical constructs - intra-modal and inter-modal effects ?? were developed to conceptualise the regional dispersal effects of low-cost carriers. The former refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other models of airline business, and the latter refers to differences between low-cost carriers and other modes of transport. Logit models and national-level revealed preference data were used to examine the intra-modal effects, while stated choice method was used to examine the inter-modal effects on two representative regional tourism destinations - Ballina-Byron and Cairns - in Australia.     This thesis provides evidence that suggest low-cost carrier air arrivals tend to disperse for reasons that are different from network carrier air arrivals, supporting the significance of intra-modal effects on regional dispersal. It is claimed that the intra-modal effect is one reason why some destinations observe high growth in airport activity as a result of low-cost carrier entry, but the levels of tourism activities do not match that extrapolated from the level of growth in the incoming air traffic. Two case studies have shown that (1) ground transport policy can completely offset the negative effects on tourists?? dispersal propensity stemming from pre-determined trip characteristics, although the effectiveness of such policy variables varies significantly across destinations; and (2) significant discounts in airfares are sufficient to trigger a modal switch, even in situations when a car is the most suitable mode for the trip, suggesting a real possibility of a bypass of ground-mode-reliant regions. The findings should be of interest to regional destination managers with low-cost carrier services as much as for managers in peripheral destinations without low-cost carrier services.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44281</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Combined transcription modulating agents to overcome MycN-mediated retinoid reistance in hish risk neuroblastoma</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Tue Gia, Women's &amp; Children's Health, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common solid tumor of early infancy. Despite a significant improvement in the general survival rate for children with cancer, the prognosis of high-risk NB remains low, at about 30%, despite the use of intensive chemo-radiotherapy followed by differentiation therapy with retinoic acid (RA). Relapses in this category of NB are often due to the emergence of multi-drug and RA-resistant minimal residual cancer cells. The use of natural 13-cis RA, as a single chemo-preventive agent, has improved the survival rate to 50% for high-risk NB patients. However, the prevalence of RA-resistance is high in high-risk NB, and in solid cancers, in general. RA-resistance in cancer cells is mediated by a number of factors. Loss of RA-induced expression of the putative tumor suppressor gene, retinoic acid receptor-beta (RAR&#61621;&#946;), is one of the most common factors that have been reported in RAresistant phenotypes of a wide range of cancer cells. The transcriptional regulation of RAR(&#946;) gene and other retinoid responsive-genes is believed to be regulated by the ligand-dependent transactivation of the homo- or heterodimer complexes of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) subtypes, namely alpha (&#945;), beta (&#946;) and gamma (&#947;). It is believed that the anti-cancer activities of natural all-trans RA and 13-cis RA are mediated through activation of RAR-complexes. The loss of RA-induced RAR &#946; expression can be caused by aberrant recruitment of chromatin structure modifying enzymes, histone deacetylases (HDACs), which have major roles in the global regulation of gene transcription. However, the mechanism of RA-resistance in NB cells is unclear. This thesis set out to identify the molecular mechanism of RA-resistance and to develop a new therapeutic approach to overcome RA-resistance in NB cells. The data in this thesis demonstrated that deregulation or over-expression of proto-oncogene MYCN caused a total RA-resistance in NB cells in vitro and in vivo, despite the strong induction of RARI3 expression. The data also indicated that the activation of RAR-dependent pathways by aRA or 13RA alone is not sufficient to overcome MYCN-mediated RA-resistance in NB cells. In the light of this observation, this thesis went on to examine whether combined targeting activation of RAR and RXR subtypes with receptor specific ligands could enhance the therapeutic efficacy of the retinoid signaling pathway. NB cells were treated with a panel of receptor-specific retinoids, namely aRA, l3RA, 9RA (RAR-specific), CD 417, CD 2314 (RAR&#946;-specific), CD 666 (RAR&#947;-specific), CD 336 (RAR&#945;-specific), CD 3640, CD 2872 (RXR-specific), as a single agent or in combination at a low concentration of 0.1 ??M. The results showed that combined targeting activation of RAR&#945; and RXR was not only the most effective combination, but also overcame MYCN-mediated RA-resistance in NB cells in vitro.Collectively, these data demonstrated the combined targeting activation of RAR&#61621; and RXRs as a new approach to enhance the efficacy of retinoid therapy and overcome RA-resistance in the treatment of high-risk NB, and other cancers.  The emerging therapeutic potential of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) as front line anti-cancer agents, or adjuvants to other agents such as RA, has suggested a new approach in the treatment of cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of the remarkably specific anticancer actions of HDACi is still largely speculation. The data presented in this study was the first to demonstrate a novel sequential order and the dosage-dependent roles of basal p21Wafl expression and G2/M arrest as protective mechanisms against HDACi-induced apoptosis. In addition, this thesis also examined and compared the therapeutic efficacy of HDACi as a single agent and in combination with other anti-cancer agents such as RA, IFN&#945; and chemotherapeutic agents. Evaluation of the therapeutic effects of combinations of aRA, IFN&#61621; and HDACi showed that combination of HDACi and IFN&#945; exhibited the strongest synergy against NB cells in vitro. Treatment of MYCN transgenic mice, which consistently develop abdominal NB tumors that closely mirror the human disease in both physiological and biological aspects, with hydroxamic acid-based HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA), alone reduced tumor growth by nearly 50%, compared to the solvent control and IFN&#945; alone, which had no effect on NB tumor growth. The most exciting finding was that the combination of HDACi and IFN&#945; synergistically reduced tumor mass and angiogenesis by over 80% without any apparent systemic side-effects. The therapeutic effect of treatment with HDACi correlated with the induction of acetylation of histone 4 protein (H4) in both tumor and organ tissues, indicating a wide therapeutic index for HDACi in vivo. Collectively, the data in this study have demonstrated basal p21 Wafl expression as a potential marker of sensitivity to HDACi-based therapy, and the therapeutic efficacy of a novel combination of HDACi with IFN&#945; in vivo. These preclinical data have provided an evidence-based rationale for a clinical trial of the combination of HDACi and IFN&#945; in the treatment of high risk NB.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Tumors in children -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Neuroblastoma -- Chemotherapy.</field><field name="subject">Retinoids.</field><field name="subject">Drug resistance in cancer cells.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44285</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Banana-kids: Chineseness in the contemporary Australian community</field><field name="creator">Cham, Douglas, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">The MFA research project Banana-kids: Chineseness in the contemporary Australian community comprises a body of studio work, largely ceramic, and an accompanying document. Its aim is to investigate the effect of ??Chineseness?? inscribed on those Chinese Australians born in Australia or arriving in infancy, in contemporary Australian society. The study commences with the experience of my Australian-born mother who dressed as an Australian, talked as an Australian and thought as an Australian, but nonetheless looked physically Chinese. She was assimilated into the Australian community; however, she was not allowed to return to Australia from Hong Kong at the end of World War II, despite holding an Australian birth certificate, since she had married in Hong Kong before the war and her passport had been burnt during the period of conflict. The studio component of the study is realized as a Chinese formal dinner setting which includes chopstick-holders reconfigured as Australian animals and a Chinese labourer??s carrying device, ??Jook-sing??, as a flower vase. Narrative and parody are engaged in the work as a means of reflecting on ??Aussie culture?? through my eyes as a Chinese artist. The twelve chopstick-holders each manifest ??Chineseness?? as well as certain characteristics of Australian culture. The document applies the methodology of exegesis to record and elucidate the development of the research. It is expected that the installation of these studio outcomes will arouse in the viewer an awareness of the attitudes and responses that the Australian-born Chinese experience everyday.

For many of these conditions the pathophysiology and clinical management continue to be debated. This is particularly so for anal fissures, anal incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. Procedures Followed: A series of clinical trials was performed. Anal Fissure: Two current management regimes for chronic anal fissure, Glyceryl Trinitrate and Botulinum Toxin, were prospectively assessed for manometric and clinical outcome. A new treatment regime, inducible nitric oxide, was prospectively assessed in an animal model and a new manometric observation in anal fissure patients, the Fast Wave, was validated. Anal Incontinence: The magnitude of the problem and the relative role of several previously identified risk factors was assessed from a manometric data-base. The impact of a standard treatment for Crohn???s disease, the seton, on anal continence was assessed via a retrospective cohort study. The long-term outcome of dynamic graciloplasty and re-do anal sphincter repair, two previously accepted treatments for anal incontinence, were also assessed retrospectively. A new intervention for treating anal incontinence, the magnetic ???Chair???, was prospectively trialed in incontinent patients. Pelvic Floor Dysfunction: A new treatment option for rectocoele, the laparoscopic repair, was compared with an accepted treatment option, the transanal repair via a matched cohort study. A further group of patients with multiple symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction undergoing the same laparoscopic technique were then prospectively assessed for functional outcome across the pelvic floor compartments. General Results: Anal Fissure; The manometric effects of both glyceryl trinitrate and botulinum toxin, demonstrated in this thesis would imply that their mode of impact on the anal sphincter is other than that of anal pressure reduction. Fissure healing is dependent upon the pre-treatment anal resting pressure and fissure grade, not anal pressures following treatment. Inducible nitric oxide does not increase nitrate levels in the rat internal anal sphincter. A new manometric wave form in the hypertonic internal anal sphincter, the Fast Wave, has been validated. Faecal Incontinence; Faecal incontinence is multi-factorial. However, obstetric birth injuries are the most significant factor predisposing to faecal incontinence following age. Furthermore current government policies are failing to address the problem. The dynamic graciloplasty provides symptomatic long-term relief in only 16 percent of patients and results in significant co-morbidity in most patients. Re-do anal sphincter repair provides relief in 60 percent of patients without further side effects. The use of a seton in Crohn???s perianal disease prevents deterioration of patient continence. Extracorporeal magnetic stimulation, the Chair, may provide significant relief for patients with faecal incontinence. Pelvic Floor Dysfunction: The laparoscopic posterior compartment repair provides relief of bowel symptoms in 31 percent of patients. This does not compare favourably with the transanal long-term symptomatic improvement of 67 percent. The results of the laparoscopic pelvic floor repair in patients with multiple symptoms of pelvic floor dysfunction is disappointing, particularly for bowel and bladder symptom improvement. Major Conclusions: This thesis questions the accepted pathophysiology of anal fissure, highlights the long-term implications of obstetric childbirth injuries on faecal continence and raises concerns about current management strategies for faecal incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">defecation disorders</field><field name="subject">anus</field><field name="subject">rectum</field><field name="subject">diseases.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime in steelmaking slag and development of fluoride-free fluxes</field><field name="creator">Haji Amini, Shahriar, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">A rotating disk technique was used to determine the dissolution rate and diffusivity of CaO and MgO in slags. The dissolution rate was deduced from the measured changes in concentration of oxides in slag with respect to reaction time. The experimental set- up was initially tested with dissolution of magnesia in the CaO ??? 55 wt% Al2O3 slag at 1430 ??C and a measured rate of 2.7 ??10 -5 g/cm2.s was obtained. The dissolution rate was increased by slag chemistry and ranged from 6.5??10-5 to 2.1??10-4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rate of CaO was measured in CaO ??? 42 wt% Al2O3 ??? 8% SiO2 based slag. The measured dissolution rates were found to be strongly dependent on the slag chemistry and temperature and ranged from 5.03??10 -5 to 3.3??10 -4 g/cm2.s. The dissolution rates were strongly dependent on the rotation speed and results indicate mass transfer in the slag phase to be rate- limiting step. The diffusivity of MgO / CaO was calculated from the dissolution rate and solubility data, using known mass transfer correlations. The diffusivity of MgO in the calcium aluminate slag at 1430 ??C was found to be about 1.1??10-5 cm2/s. Additions of 5 and 10 wt% Fe2O3 increased the diffusivity by a factor ~ 1.5 to 3, respectively. However, with introduction of (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 5 wt%) and (CaF2 5 wt% + Fe2O3 10 wt%) in the slag, the diffusivity increased considerably by a factor of about 29 and 11, respectively. The diffusivity of CaO in calcium aluminosilicate was measured to be in the order of 10-6 to 10-5 over a temperature range of 1430 ??? 1600 ??C. CaF2 increased the diffusivity by a factor of 3 to 5 while MnOx and FeOx, ilmenite and TiO 2 increased the diffusivity substantially and SiO2 had an opposite effect. The measured diffusivities are in accord with published data on comparable systems and are discussed with reference to Eyring theory. It was concluded that MnOx, FeOx and ilmenite in the slag increase the dissolution rate and diffusivity of lime, showing comparable results with respect to CaF2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">slag</field><field name="subject">steel</field><field name="subject">lime</field><field name="subject">flux (metallurgy).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of the transport needs concept to rural New South Wales : a GIS-based analysis</field><field name="creator">Rostami, Shahbakhti, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">The story of transport and accessibility problems in rural Australia is very similar to other wealthy countries with low rural densities and long distances such as the US and Canada ??? little or no public transport, very high levels of car ownership, and poor service provision. During the past two decades rationalisation and privatisation of services has led to the closure of many basic services in rural Australia. The withdrawal of services has necessitated longer distance travel for many rural residents ??? a problem which has been exacerbated by the rationalisation of public transport services. As a result there have emerged severe accessibility and mobility problems in rural areas, despite the presence of high levels of car ownership in such areas. In terms of rural transportation, the situation in Australia is characterised by two different features; first, poor public transport provision (or non-existence). Second; high levels of car ownership among rural residents. However, high levels of car ownership do not reflect high levels of prosperity; this is likely to indicate a situation of &amp;quotenforced ownership&amp;quot in response to declining levels of public transport provision. Furthermore, many rural residents neither own a car nor have access to a reliable public transport system due to socio-economic and location-based circumstances. Previous research has shown that these residents generally belong to groups who include the elderly, teenagers, students, Indigenous residents, unemployed persons and low-income households. Such groups have been termed transport-disadvantaged. The contention of this thesis, however, is that such groups are in a state of &amp;quottransport need&amp;quot given their range of transport related problems. This is one dimension of the accessibility problem in rural Australia, which has yet to be investigated. This thesis is concerned with the measurement of transport need through the development of several transport need indices using available census data. The key objective of this thesis is to investigate the relevance and suitability of need indices for identifying the relative spatial distribution of transport needs in rural areas. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is used for the development, analysis and visualisation of the transport need index. This thesis examines transportation needs in rural NSW simply by measuring &amp;quotdemand&amp;quot and &amp;quotsupply&amp;quot components of transport. To measure the demand index, some socio-economic characteristics of population are involved including: the elderly, no or low car owning households, Indigenous people, students, children, unemployed persons, low-income households, and accessibility. A weight has been assigned to each component based on its relative importance among the other components. Weighted values are then standardised based on 100. To measure the supply index, six components, which represent the availability of various kinds of transport in rural NSW are involved and have been calculated by assigning weights and standardising to 100. These are: CountryLink rail services, CountryLink coach and bus services, Regional Services, Community Transport Program, Wheelchair taxi services, and School Buses. The final transport need for rural NSW is calculated by dividing demand index by supply index. It simply quantifies transportation needs across the rural Statistical Local Areas (SLAs) of NSW. In addition, this thesis discusses the potential and limitations of GIS and our transport need indices to be used as input to decisions about improvements in provision of services, and coordination of existing services to better meet identified needs, for the transport disadvantaged in rural NSW. In essence, this thesis is an attempt to make Australian transport and social services planners aware of the value of a need based transport-planning methodology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transportation</field><field name="subject">rural transportation</field><field name="subject">geographic information systems</field><field name="subject">New South Wales.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22472</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A graphic investigation of the atlas as a narrative format for the visual communication of cultural and social data</field><field name="creator">Gregory, Richard Cedric Thomas, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">Maps and atlases are traditionally convenient documents for representing the surface of the earth.

Furthermore, they capture the reader's imagination by provoking the desire for adventure and exploration. Occasionally maps are also censored because they are an efficient means of indicating strategic features.  This project concerns the historical and contemporary examples of communicating information visually by analysing a selection of conventional literary and visual sources, which informs the research. It includes graphic forms that present abundant data, for example, atlases and texts on the architectural history of Central Asia, Tibet, China and Japan. The studio works will examine illustration, draughtsmanship, rendering, and textual/visual imagery.  The outcome will be an illustrated atlas of traditional architecture in the earthquake zones of Central Asia (Xinjiang), Tibet, China, Japan and related areas. The graphic format is used as a narrative for the communication of environmental, cultural and architectural data of the region. The atlas is also intended to present the subject in a holistic form in relation to environmental influences on the structures and materiality of buildings, and the broader field of history.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44346</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reaching likeness through unlikeness: the interpretation and application of busi zhi si in contemporary drawing</field><field name="creator">Li, Wenmin, Art, College of Fine Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research started with the question of how a contemporary artist could draw an object with its form and essence in a similar way to that of Chinese traditional artists. It is based on the exploration of the interpretations of busi zhi si &#19981;&#20284;&#20043;&#20284; (likeness of unlikeness), which has searched for the answers to a question how it is possible to interpret and apply the concept of ??likeness?? and ??essence?? of an object as depicted by Chinese traditional artists. More importantly, it has led to a process in which a contemporary artist endeavours to apply a particularly traditional concept to contemporary drawing practice properly. It is this approach towards Chinese aesthetics and philosophy with proper attitudes, which has greatly oriented the research in terms of its methodology. The focus of this research has been on the application of the designed methods, including the implementation of the methods in drawing, evaluation of the outcomes and reflection of the evaluation in practice. This written work serves as documentation and explanation of how this process has been carried out, as drawing has been the major component of the research. Chinese traditional learning method has been interpreted philosophically in this research in order to set up the practical methods to reach the main goal of depicting the essential likeness of the object. However, due to the various mediums being employed, distinctive from Chinese traditional medium, the Chinese learning methods have been interpreted as being imitations of the traditional way of depicting the objects. Three aspects in depicting the object, which are observation, outer likeness and interpretative likeness, have been studied in relation to Chinese aesthetics. This process of research has provided a means to build a bridge between Chinese and western aesthetical grounds on depictions of the likeness and essence of an object. The promising future of this ongoing research therefore seems to be more exciting to drawers with particular interests in applying aesthetic concepts in practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44347</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Controlled synthetic approach to di- and trinuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes</field><field name="creator">Shearer, Timothy Kenneth, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the synthesis and characterisation of a variety of acetylide-bridged di- and trinuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes that were prepared in a controlled fashion, and the preparation and characterisation of the ruthenium(II) complexes required for these stepwise reactions. These precursor complexes, or building blocks, include dimethyl-, acetylidomethyl-, and bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes. An introduction to metal acetylide chemistry is presented in Chapter 1. The previous research in this area is briefly reviewed, and the potential applications of these complexes are highlighted. The primary aims of this course of work are outlined, namely, to develop a controlled synthetic approach to the synthesis of oligonuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes. The synthetic strategies for this aim are introduced in Chapter 2, and the synthetic routes to cis and trans-Ru(CH3)2(dmpe)2 (25/23) and cis and trans-Ru(CH3)2(depe)2 (26/24) are described. Characterisation of the novel, synthetically important trans-Ru(CH3)2(dmpe)2 (23) is completed by an examination of its X-Ray crystallographic structure. Chapter 3 describes the thermal and photochemical metathesis reactions of trans-Ru(CH3)2(dmpe)2 (23) with terminal acetylenes, and the preparation of a variety of acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complexes, trans-Ru(CH3)(C&#8801;CR)(dmpe)2 (R = Ph (30), tBu (31), SiMe3 (32), C6H4-4-tBu (33), C6H3-3,5-tBu2 (34), C6H4-4-C&#8801;CH (35), C6H4-4-OCH3 (36), C6H4-4-CH3 (37), C6H3-3,5-(CF3)2 (38)). The characterisation of these complexes by NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy and X-Ray crystallography is presented. A clean and high yielding synthesis of the synthetically significant unsymmetrical bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes was developed via the reaction of an acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complex with an excess of a second terminal alkyne in a mixture of methanol and benzene. The characterisation of the novel complexes trans-Ru(C&#8801;CR)(C&#8801;CR&#8242;)(dmpe)2 (R = Ph, R&#8242; = tBu (40), SiMe3 (41), C6H4-4-C&#8801;CH (44); R = tBu, R&#8242; = SiMe3 (42), C6H4-4-C&#8801;CH (43), C6H4-4-tBu (45), C6H3-3,5-tBu2 (46)) by NMR and IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-Ray crystallography is described in Chapter 4. Additionally, Chapter 4 describes the synthesis and characterisation of symmetrical bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes, and a number of organic butenyne compounds, which were observed as by-products from the attempted synthesis of several of the bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complexes. Dinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes were prepared by the reaction of trans-Ru(C&#8801;CR)(C&#8801;CC6H4-4-C&#8801;CH)(dmpe)2 (R = tBu (43) or Ph (44)) with an acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complex in toluene and methanol. Both symmetrical and unsymmetical dinuclear complexes could be prepared in this way, and were characterised by a range of techniques including NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-Ray crystallography, and are described in Chapter 5. In addition, an electrochemical study of one of the dinuclear complexes was undertaken using cyclic voltammetry. The symmetrical trinuclear ruthenium(II) complexes, trans,trans,trans- (RC&#8801;C)Ru(dmpe)2(&#956;-C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C)Ru(depe)2(&#956;-C&#8801;CC6H4C&#8801;C)Ru(dmpe)2(C&#8801;CR) (R = Ph (80), tBu (81), SiMe3 (82)) was prepared by the reaction of two equivalents of an acetylidomethylruthenium(II) complex with the symmetrical bis(acetylido)ruthenium(II) complex, trans-Ru(C&#8801;CC6H4-4-C&#8801;CH)2(depe)2 (54), in toluene and methanol. These syntheses, and the subsequent characterisation of the products are also reported in Chapter 5. The primary aim of this thesis, viz. the synthesis and characterisation of acetylide bridged di- and trinuclear ruthenium acetylide complexes in a controlled fashion, was successfully achieved.

Fertile patches are created and maintained by processes that modify soil topography and interrupt the flow of resources across the landscape. These processes may be abiotic or biotic in origin. Species that modify, maintain or create habitat have been termed ecosystem engineers. One group of soil disturbing ecosystem engineers creates fertile patches by modifying soil microtopography through foraging for food and creating habitat. This thesis examines the effects of soil foraging animals on resource concentration in arid environments and how effects are moderated by species and landscape. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the importance of fertile patches in arid systems and describes previous research on the effects of ecosystem engineers in arid environments. Chapter 2 examines how fertile patch creation by a well-studied arid zone engineer, the ant, varies between ant species and landforms, demonstrating that while we can generalise about the effects of ant nests on water flow and nutrient levels, differences in soil type, nest density and ant species across sites are likely to moderate these effects. Chapters 3, 4 and 5 compare the engineering effects of reintroduced native species, the Greater bilby (Macrotis lagotis) and Burrowing bettong (Bettongia lesueur) with the Sand goanna (Varanus gouldii) and the invasive European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) across three Australian landforms, revealing differences between reintroduced and invasive engineers at the both patch and landscape scales. At the landscape scale, differences in pit densities and resource concentration in foraging pits between landforms suggest that fertile patch development is not uniform. Chapter 6 examines whether the structure of the pit or the presence of litter per se explains observed increases in plant germination in foraging pits, and compares temperature and soil moisture conditions in bilby and bettong pits to the soil surface. Chapter 7 is a review that builds upon previous chapters, published and unpublished literature of the potential for reintroductions of ecosystem engineers to restore ecosystem function in degraded environments. Chapter 8 summarises the research presented in this thesis and its implications, and suggests directions for future work.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecosystem engineer</field><field name="subject">Arid</field><field name="subject">Ecology</field><field name="subject">Disturbance</field><field name="subject">Fertile patch</field><field name="subject">Mammal</field><field name="subject">Bilby</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The potential function of ATP-binding cassette A7 in the brain: implications for Alzheimer's disease.</field><field name="creator">Chan, Lai Ling Sharon, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">ABCA7 is the closest homologue of ABCA1, which is established to play a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. ABCA1 deficiency causes Tangier disease and several ABCA1 modulations have been recently associated with Alzheimer&#146;s disease. Prior research on ABCA7 focused on its role in macrophage lipid efflux and phagocytosis, however, tissue expression studies in mice revealed that ABCA7 is highly expressed in the brain. The function of ABCA7 in the brain is unknown and the purpose of this thesis was therefore to investigate the potential function of ABCA7 in the brain and the possible implications for Alzheimer&#146;s disease. This was achieved by using in vitro models that transiently express ABCA7 and in vivo models including ABCA7 knockout (ABCA7 KO) mice and human APP transgenic (APPSwInd Tg) mice. ABCA7 was shown to potently stimulate cholesterol efflux from cells to extracellular apoE acceptors. Additionally, apoE expression was decreased by 20% in the brains of ABCA7 KO mice compared to wild type littermate controls and by 46% in ABCA7-deficient macrophages. In vitro models that stably express human APP protein demonstrated that the transient expression of ABCA7 increased intracellular APP targeting, which led to the inhibition of APP processing and a resultant decrease in the production of A&#946;. In addition, ABCA7-deficient macrophages displayed impaired capacity to endocytose and degrade A&#946; oligomers. Finally, in aged APPSwInd Tg mice where abundant amyloid plaques were present, ABCA7 expression was significantly decreased by 48%. Since cholesterol homeostasis modulates APP processing, the findings of this thesis suggest that ABCA7 may have a role in maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis via cholesterol efflux to apoE acceptors and possibly by regulating intracellular trafficking of specific membrane proteins. In summary, ABCA7 was clearly shown in this thesis to have an effect on A&#946; generation, clearance and degradation. Furthermore, ABCA7 expression was also affected by A&#946; deposition in the brain. Even though more work is required to further elucidate the exact function of ABCA7, the findings presented in this thesis provide the first clues to the function of ABCA7 in the brain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Amyloid beta</field><field name="subject">ABCA7</field><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">APP processing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/44409</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The best laid plans: medical students' responses to new curricula</field><field name="creator">Balasooriya, Chinthaka Damith, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis explores whether a carefully designed educational program can impact unfavourably on a proportion of students, what the magnitude of this proportion may be, whether previously identified ???deep enhancing??? features could stimulate surface approaches in some students, and the possible reasons for such paradoxical impact. These questions are set within a context of continuing efforts to find the ???ideal??? medical curriculum, and where evaluation studies of these curricular methods have failed to demonstrate the expected degree of positive impact. This leads to the final question of the thesis, which is whether the phenomenon of different responses by different students, could help explain the less-than-expected positive impact of curricular innovations reported in the literature. The questions were explored through a series of three studies. The First study consisted of individual student interviews and surveys (using the R-SPQ-2F, Biggs et al 2001) during a traditional program in medicine and upon conclusion of an educational program designed along currently accepted principles associated with higher quality learning outcomes. The two follow up studies included surveying students in two other settings in medical education. These studies were useful to overcome some of the limitations of the First study, and to explore the possible wider prevalence of the findings of the First study. The findings of the First study indicated that one-third of the student group did respond unfavourable to a carefully designed educational program. The interview findings highlighted this phenomenon, and illustrated how these students responded to ???deep enhancing curricular features??? by changing to more surface approaches. The survey findings supported these findings, and helped cluster and categorise students into subgroups who responded to the Pilot program in distinct ways. The two follow up studies indicated similar patterns of response in the other settings of medical education, and suggested that this phenomenon may be more widely prevalent. The findings suggest an area of research that requires further exploration. If confirmed and extended by further work, the findings could have significant theoretical and practical implications for medical education. From a theoretical perspective, the findings enrich the current theory of student approaches to learning by beginning to unravel the complex interaction between student and context factors that lead to approaches. The thesis further contributes to the literature by its finding that some previously identified ???deep enhancing??? context factors could stimulate change to more surface approaches in some students, and by the finding that different students??? approaches could change in different directions, when measured before and after the same ???deep enhancing??? educational context. From a practical perspective, the findings could be relevant to designers and evaluators of medical curricula, and to facilitators of small group learning. An understanding of the different patterns of response that may be expected, and an understanding of different strategies that may better support these different subgroups, may help optimise the benefits of curricular design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">medical education</field><field name="subject">curricula</field><field name="subject">curriculum planning</field><field name="subject">medical students</field><field name="subject">attitude</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Prediction of offshore gravity from bathymetry</field><field name="creator">Sproule, David, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">The definition of the shape of the geoid is a fundamental objective of geodesy, since it allows for the conversion between orthometric and ellipsoidal height systems. The geoid can be computed from gravity values measured over the surface of the earth, and considerable effort continues to achieve a global coverage of gravity values. One technique that has been very successful in recent years in providing gravity coverage in areas which previously have been too difficult to access is airborne gravimetry. This technique has proved very useful in covering near offshore regions, for example. The coastal regions of Australia are recognised as locations where airborne gravimetry has the potential to fill in missing gravity data. A pilot survey using an airborne gravity meter was undertaken off the north east coast of Australia. In areas that remain unsurveyed it is sometimes useful to fill in the missing gravity data values with predicted gravity values. Previous research has examined the possibility of predicting gravity values from other observed quantities. The best success has been achieved by using the gravity effect calculated from bathymetric information. Often the corresponding isostatic compensation is computed, and the combined bathymetric-isostatic gravity effect is used. However, the type and extent of compensation that exists in any particular region mostly remains unknown. Theoretical considerations indicate that the short wavelength part of the gravity field may be adequately modelled by the gravity effect of the bathymetry alone, without reference to an assumed compensation mechanism. With this in mind, a prediction scheme has been developed which utilises the short wavelength gravity field information implied by the bathymetry, combined with the long wavelength gravity field information from existing observed gravity. This scheme allows the prediction of ???fill-in??? gravity values in areas with limited observed gravity. The prediction technique was used on a test set of data off the east coast of Greenland. The prediction technique was seen to outperform a simple interpolation of gravity values by approximately ten percent. Geoid computations performed with the predicted gravity values indicate that the prediction technique can provide significant improvements in computed geoids.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">gravity</field><field name="subject">measurement</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22481</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Art of place and displacement: embodied perception and the haptic ground</field><field name="creator">King, Victoria, School of Art History &amp; Theory, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the relationship between art and place, and challenges conventional readings of the paintings of the late Aboriginal Anmatyerr elder Emily Kame Kngwarray of Australia and Canadian/American modernist artist Agnes Martin. In the case of Kngwarray, connections between body, ground and canvas are extensively explored through stories told to the author by Emily???s countrywomen at Utopia in the Northern Territory. In the case of Agnes Martin, these relationships are explored through personal interview with the artist in Taos, New Mexico, and by phenomenological readings of her paintings. The methodology is based on analysis of narrative, interview material, existing critical literature and the artists??? paintings. The haptic and embodiment emerge as strong themes, but the artists??? use of repetition provides fertile ground to question wholly aesthetic or cultural readings of their paintings. The thesis demonstrates the significance of historical and psychological denial and erasure, as well as transgenerational legacies in the artists??? work. A close examination is made of the artists??? use of surface shimmer in their paintings and the effects of it on the beholder. The implications of being mesmerized by shimmer, especially in the case of Aboriginal paintings, bring up ethical questions about cultural difference and the shadow side of art in its capacity for complicity, denial, appropriation and commodification. This thesis challenges the ocularcentric tradition of seeing the land and art, and examines what occurs when a painting is viewed on the walls of a gallery. It addresses Eurocentric readings of Aboriginal art and looks at the power of the aesthetic gaze that eliminates cultural difference. Differences between space and place are explored through an investigation of the phenomenology of perception, the haptic, embodiment and ???presentness???. Place affiliation and the effects of displacement are examined to discover what is often taken for granted: the ground beneath our feet. Art can express belonging and relationship with far-reaching cultural, political, psychological and environmental implications, but only if denial and loss of place are acknowledged.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">art</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australian</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22495</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Spatial order and sense of community in high-rise apartment developments in Bundang, the metropolitan area of Seoul, Korea</field><field name="creator">Lee, Seok Heon, Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis aims to investigate the relationship between the provision of spatial order and perceived sense of community in high-rise housing developments in Korea from a socio-spatial and architectural perspective. It also considers relationships between the perception of neighbourhood, provision of facilities, design aspects, and socio-economic characteristics and sense of community. The study uses a questionnaire survey as the main research instrument conducted across four case studies in Bundang new town, in metropolitan Seoul, Korea. Two of the cases were selected as having a high provision of spatial order and the other two low provision according to the concepts of Altman (1975) and Newman (1972, 1975). Quantitative analysis is carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis/Mann-Whitney test and Spearman???s rank correlation to identify differences and correlations between cases. The results indicate that there is no clear evidence that a sense of community has a direct relationship with the provision of spatial order in the selected cases. However, in the high provision cases outdoor common spaces appear to have a role in contributing to social interaction. Among Buckner???s (1988) three sub-variables of his concept of neighbourhood cohesion, ???neighbouring??? appears to be more associated with the provision of spatial order rather than ???attraction-to-neighbourhood??? or ???psychological sense of community.??? A greater number of opportunities for social interactions occur in an intermediate space located between private dwelling units and public open space in cases with a high provision of spatial order. However, this is likely to be due to the location of shared facilities and their frequency of use. In terms of the relationship between design and a sense of community, ???landscaping??? was found to be the most important variable, followed by the ???design of streets/footpath??? and ???facilities for children???, ???parking???, and ???recreational activities???. Despite the lack of a clear relationship between design and a sense of community, a strong demand was found for improved outdoor amenity and greater provision of facilities. Socio-economic status appears not to be a significant factor directly influencing the sense of community however, age and the existence of children are associated with the perception of neighbourhood.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">high rise apartment buildings</field><field name="subject">architecture</field><field name="subject">human factors</field><field name="subject">Korea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22498</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stones, ripples, waves: refiguring The first stone media event</field><field name="creator">Taylor, Anthea, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This interdisciplinary study critically revisits the Australian print media???s engagement with Helen Garner???s controversial work of ???non-fiction???, The First Stone (1995). Print news media engagement with the book, marked by intense discursive contestation over feminism, has been constituted both by feminists and other critics as a significant cultural signpost. However, the highly visible print media event following the book???s publication raised a plethora of critical questions and dilemmas that remain unsatisfactorily addressed. Building upon John Fiske???s work on media events as sites of maximum visibility and discursive turbulence (Fiske: 1996), this study re-theorises the public dialogue following The First Stone???s publication in terms of four constitutive elements: narrative, celebrity, audience, and history and conflict. Through an analysis of these four diverse yet interconnected aspects of the media event, I create a critical space not only for its limitations to emerge but also the frequently overlooked possibilities it offers in terms of the wider feminism and print media culture relationship. As part of its central aim to refigure The First Stone media event, this thesis argues against prior characterisations of the debate as constitutive of either a monologic articulation of conservative, antifeminist voices or an unmitigated attack on its author by a homogenous feminism. In particular, I use this media event as indicative of the sophistication and complexity of media engagement with contemporary feminism, despite both continued derision and overly simplistic celebration of this relationship. Texts subject to analysis here include: The First Stone, various ???mainstream??? media representations and self-representations of three ???celebrity feminists??? (Helen Garner, Anne Summers and Jenna Mead), letters to the editor of newspapers and magazines, ???popular??? feminist books by Kathy Bail and Virginia Trioli, and a number of media texts in which those claiming a feminist subject position and those sympathetic to feminism act as either news sources or columnists/commentators. Although Garner???s narrative is throughout identified to be deeply problematic, I argue that the media event it precipitated provides valuable insights into both the opportunities and the constraints of the print media-feminism nexus in 1990s Australia.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Garner</field><field name="subject">Helen</field><field name="subject">First stone; Women novelists</field><field name="subject">Australian; Mass media -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22506</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corneal response to overnight orthokeratology</field><field name="creator">Alharbi, Ahmed A, Optometry &amp; Vision Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Orthokeratology (OK) is the reduction, modification or elimination of myopia through application of contact lenses. With the development of high Dk/t lens materials, overnight therapy has become the modality of choice for OK. Overnight OK lens wear has been previously investigated in terms of its efficacy to reduce myopia. However, the underlying effects of overnight OK lens wear on the human cornea have received less attention. As well as the clinical efficacy of overnight OK, this study investigated the effects of overnight OK on topographical corneal thickness and the overnight corneal edema response, and corneal tissue changes with overnight OK. Eighteen subjects participated as the OK lens-wearing group, wearing BE lenses (UltraVision, Brisbane, Queensland) in both eyes. A further ten subjects participated as control subjects, wearing conventional rigid lenses (J-Contour, UltraVision) in the right eye (RE) only. The left eye (LE) acted as a non-lens-wearing control. Both groups wore lenses overnight only, with no lens wear during the day. Measurements were conducted at baseline then on day 1, 4, 10, 30, 60, and 90 for the OK lens-wearing eyes; and up to day 30 for the control group, in the morning (after overnight lens wear) and in the evening (after 8-10 hours of lens removal). Variables measured included best vision sphere (BVS), unaided logMAR visual acuity (VA), refractive astigmatism, apical corneal power (ACP), simulated K readings (Medmont E300 corneal topographer), topographical corneal thickness (Holden-Payor optical pachometer), and keratocyte and endothelial cell densities (ConfoScan2 confocal microscope).  Approximately 75% of myopia was corrected after the first night of OK lens wear and the changes in refractive error stabilised by day 10. By day 90, myopia reduction averaged 2.54 ?? 0.63 D. This was associated with significant improvement in unaided VA of about 82% after the first night of lens wear. There was no change in refractive astigmatism over the 3-month period. There was significant reduction in ACP in the OK lens-wearing eyes after the first night of lens wear, which accounted for more than 70% of the total ACP change over the 3-month period (RE: -2.16 ?? 0.53 D; LE: -2.11 ?? 0.86 D). There was significant central epithelial thinning (about 30%) and significant thickening (about 3%) in the mid-peripheral stroma in the OK lens-wearing eyes. Significant central epithelial thinning was found after the first night of lens wear while thickening in the mid-peripheral stroma reached statistical significance by day 4. Further analysis suggests that topographical corneal thickness changes account for the refractive error changes with overnight OK lens wear, rather than corneal bending. The central overnight stromal edema response was significantly reduced in the OK lens-wearing eyes (1.2 ?? 0.5%) to a level lower than in the conventional RGP (6.2 ?? 1.2%) and non-lens-wearing eyes (2.5 ?? 0.9%) in the control group. Mid-peripheral and peripheral stromal edema responses showed similar levels to those predicted based on lens Dk/t. A single overnight wear of BE and Paragon Corneal Refractive Therapy (CRT) lenses showed that the edema response to BE lens wear is significantly less than in the CRT lens-wearing eyes (BE: 2.5 ?? 0.7%; CRT 3.5 ?? 1.3%) immediately on eye opening.  No significant changes were found in either central stromal keratocyte or endothelial cell densities in either OK or control groups over the study period. In conclusion, overnight OK lens wear induces significant reductions in myopia after the first night of lens wear associated with improvement in unaided VA. Overnight OK lens wear causes significant thinning in the central epithelium and significant mid-peripheral stromal thickening which results in flattening of the central cornea and steepening in the mid-periphery. Although there were no significant changes in central stromal keratocyte and endothelial cell densities, thinning of the central epithelial layer raises concerns regarding the safety of the procedure, especially with the alarming number of corneal infections reported recently in the literature.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orthokeratology</field><field name="subject">myopia</field><field name="subject">corneal thickness</field><field name="subject">corneal curvature</field><field name="subject">contact lenses</field><field name="subject">cornea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22515</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The strategic use of prior-period benchmark disclosures in management earnings forecasts</field><field name="creator">Coulton, Jeffrey James, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">I investigate the way in which Australian managers issue their earnings forecasts, and the impact this has on the reaction of equity investors and security analysts. Using a sample of 233 management earnings forecasts issued from 1994 to 2001, I find that managers are more likely to issue earnings forecasts when they have bad earnings news than good earnings news. I find that a vast majority of forecasts are ???framed??? by the use of an accompanying earnings benchmark. Forecasts are issued with varying degrees of specificity (or precision) and also with variation in additional accompanying disclosures. Forecasts issued with negative framing (forecast earnings less than benchmark earnings) are more likely to be accompanied by statements about factors external to the firm in explaining performance, while forecasts issued with positive framing (forecast earnings greater than benchmark earnings) are more likely to be accompanied by additional verifiable forecasts of components of earnings.

Developing countries themselves allocate significant sums out of their own budgets in order to stimulate development. Development is concomitantly a major goal and enterprise of the global economy. Developed countries through aid (Official Development Assistance) spend large sums purportedly to improve the development status of developing countries. Recently voices from within the developed world???s establishment have derided the performance of aid and by default the performance of state organisations charged with managing aid delivery. Australia has not been immune from this criticism. Its aid program while modest by global standards still consumes A$1.5 billion in taxpayers money each year. Australian aid is delivered primarily by the Australian International Aid Agency (AusAID) with smaller contributions through the Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Defence and Australian Federal Police. AusAID has recently faced severe criticism over failure of the aid investment in the South Pacific to engender development. Most South Pacific countries (excluding Fiji and Samoa) have failed to show desired development. A number have faced bankruptcy (Naru, Solomon Islands), while others have increasing lawlessness (Papua New Guinea). It is important in the above milieu to examine the delivery mechanisms of Australian aid through its chosen vehicle (AusAID) and determine whether aid has really been effective or not. This thesis reviews the development effectiveness of Australian aid in one Pacific island nation ??? Samoa. In this context, the effectiveness of Australian development assistance is reviewed in terms of the results of four case studies of project aid to Samoa. The four case studies cover a range of project activity in differing sectors and offer specific insights into aid policy and delivery and the effects other variables such as culture, history and development status have on development outcomes. The thesis tests the hypothesis that Australian aid to Samoa has resulted in only limited development success and then in ways that are not generally sustainable. In confirming the hypothesis, this thesis identifies that while variables such as the procedural and policy underpinnings of the Australian aid program, aid design/delivery and management, and the history, culture and development status of Samoa impact on the development outcomes, they do not prohibit development. This thesis concludes that development outcomes will be maximised when there are good macro policies present, sound sector policies and real commitments of the government and people to development. Moreover, this thesis finds that while development theories inform the debate over aid none successfully encapsulates  the actual development process.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22896</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The relationship between ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity under threat</field><field name="creator">Gonsalkorale, Karen, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ingroup bias, which refers to people???s tendency to evaluate and treat members of their ingroups better than members of outgroups, is a central feature of intergroup relations. Conceptually, ingroup bias can be comprised of ingroup positivity, outgroup negativity, or both. However, research has often confounded these components on the assumption that they are reciprocally related. The aim of this research project was to examine the relative dominance of ingroup positivity versus outgroup negativity in ingroup bias and the relationship between them. Two approaches were employed. First, a series of laboratory studies examined the effect of threat on implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes. In Study 1, ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity were assessed in the domains of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination in a context where threat appeared to be salient. Analyses within and across measures revealed that ingroup positivity was more dominant than outgroup negativity, and that ingroup and outgroup attitudes were unrelated or positively related. Experiments that manipulated the salience of realistic threat (Studies 2 and 3), symbolic threat, (Studies 6 and 7), or both (Studies 4 and 5) similarly produced nonsignificant or positive correlations between ingroup and outgroup attitudes. However, in Studies 4, 5, and 7, perceptions of symbolic threat significantly influenced intergroup attitudes. Overall, the findings of the laboratory studies suggest that although threat can shift outgroup attitudes, it does not necessarily lead to reciprocity between ingroup positivity and outgroup negativity. The second approach employed in this dissertation involved content analysis of messages posted on an Internet hate site. In contrast to the laboratory experiments, Studies 8 and 9 found that ingroup positivity significantly predicted outgroup negativity. Implications of these findings are discussed, including the possibility that ingroup positivity will be linked to outgroup hostility when people are highly identified with their ingroup and when the outgroup defines the ingroup. This dissertation contributes to the intergroup relations literature by providing a more detailed account of implicit and explicit ingroup bias, and by identifying potential conditions leading to a negative relationship between ingroup and outgroup attitudes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Small groups</field><field name="subject">social psychology</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22916</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for sustainable building tools</field><field name="creator">Liu, Yu, School of the Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">Sustainable building (SB) tools have been recognized and explored in different regions as among the most effective means to encourage, regulate and assist SB development. A large variety of SB tools have been developed and applied in the marketplace, while a number of new tools emerge each year. While the early-developed SB tools provide general references and resources, it is still not easy either to select from existing tools, to develop new tools, or to customize existing tools for any specific region. On the one hand, the quickly expanding number of tools is developed with different styles, contents, functions, underlying assumptions as well as limitations relating to the specific conditions in their origin regions. Without a comprehensive framework to classify the tools, it is difficult to select the right ones out for any specific task in hand. On the other hand, the conditions and requirements for developing SB tools in a specific region are multi-faceted and complex. Without a proper understanding of them from a holistic point of view, it is difficult to say which tools or which type of tools are indeed needed and appropriate in a region. Recognizing the demand for developing and applying specific SB tools in different regions and the confusion surrounding existing tools, this research establishes two comprehensive conceptual frameworks to classify SB tools and SB issues. The framework for SB tools includes four related categories that focus on building stakeholders, building activities, buildings, and building performances. The framework for SB issues constitutes two combined hierarchy structures each for the performance (P) factors and the decision-making (D) factors respectively. These two frameworks not only serve as guides toward identifying the types of tools (existing or not) that are needed and suitable in a specific region, but also facilitate the selection and customization of existing tools for specific regions.  Guided by the two generic frameworks established in the research, China specific conditions and requirements for SB tools are investigated. China specific SB issues are first identified from three preliminary SB tools in the country and classified according to the generic frameworks for SB issues. A questionnaire survey targeting local architects is then conducted in four selected cities. Answers in the replied questionnaires are analysed with the SPSS software and the Content Analysis method. Local architects??? perception about the relative importance of SB issues and their preferences and expectation about the characters, orientations, functions and styles of SB tools are identified and compared with that in existing SB tools. Accordingly, similarities and contradictions between existing tools and local architects??? perceptions, preferences, and expectations regarding China specific SB tools are summarized and discussed. Synthesizing the above research and investigation about the generic and regionally specific aspects of SB tools, this thesis finally proposes a holistic approach to developing generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools. First, a more balanced approach for developing SB tools in both the broad and narrow senses is proposed and discussed; second, a suite approach for developing SB tools in both the functional and spatial dimensions is proposed and discussed. Conceptual frameworks are established in the discussions; examples are provided to illustrate the concepts; and recommendations are made for further development of the generic vs. regionally specific frameworks for SB tools in China.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sustainable buildings</field><field name="subject">sustainable architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22919</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Intersemiosis in film: a metafunctional and multimodal exploration of colour and sound in the films of Wong Kar-Wai</field><field name="creator">Pun, Betty Oi-Kei, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study explores two stylistic features in the films of contemporary Hong Kong film-maker Wong Kar-Wai: colour and sound. In particular, it focuses on how transitions in colour palettes (e.g. from a natural colour spectrum to a monochromatic effect of black-and-white) and specific sound resources (such as silence) function as important semiotic resources in the films, even when they appear to create a disjunctive effect. The study draws on two perspectives on communication to explore film. The first is the metafunctional hypothesis of Systemic-Functional Linguistics, which theorises that the communicative dimensions of texts can be explored from three simultaneous ???macro-functions???: the ideational, the interpersonal and the textual metafunction. The second is multimodal communication, which stresses that multiple semiotic resources are used for meaning-making purposes and that meanings created multimodally are multiplicative in essence. From this theoretical basis the study aims to illuminate two inter-related objectives. First, that the meaning potentials of colour transition and sound are construed and enabled by the co-ordinations of meanings across different co-present semiotic resources ??? known as intersemiosis in the study. Second, that the semiotic capacities of the two resources can be usefully explored from a functional perspective. Drawing especially the notions of intersemiosis and resemiotisation the study shows that colour transition and sound are multivalent resources in Wong???s films. In other words, their meaning potentials are metafunctionally complex and are never static. The thesis argues that colour transition and sound should not be seen as having ???a??? meaning, but rather, that it is the semiotic complexities among the co-patterned resources that shape the meaning-making potential of the resources, and in turn, help contribute meaning potentials to the films.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wong, Kar-Wai</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22922</field></doc><doc><field name="title">???A CROWDED HOUSE??? Using an action research approach to address the problem of access block at Tertiary Referral Hospital. January to July 2003</field><field name="creator">Daly, Barbara, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Issue Addressed: Access block (the prolonged wait for an inpatient hospital bed after emergency department (ED) treatment) is regarded as one of the major issues currently facing emergency medicine both in Australia and internationally. At this tertiary referral hospital review of existing data has indicated that access block has continued to increase in recent years, with a sharp rise in emergency access problems since July 1999 and is now identified as a system wide problem. Objective: This research thesis sought to explore four main areas of inquiry concerning access issues within this hospital. The first objective was to determine the current bed capacity of this hospital and identify the percentage of access block within this system. The second objective was to seek an understanding of hospital clinicians??? experiences of access block and to identify the factors they perceive directly influence patient access to acute in-patient care. The third objective was to identify change strategies to improve patient access. The final objective was to determine whether collaborative participation and involvement of clinicians would lead to a change in hospital culture and foster a collective ownership of access block as a hospital wide problem. Method: In a participatory action research inquiry, hospital clinicians within this hospital were invited to be co-researchers. The process of concurrent investigation and action followed a five- part sequence of entry, issue identification, planning, action and reflection. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used including in-depth semi structured interviews, focus groups, process mapping, control charts and statistical analysis. Results: The research findings revealed a consistently high level of access block experienced by this hospital with bed occupancy rates in excess of 90%. During the study, hospital clinicians??? became actively involved in identifying major access issues. Six main delay categories evolved: Access delays due to limited imaging and diagnostic services, patient transport delays, barriers within the patient discharges process, insufficient access and availability to transitional, hostel, rehabilitation and nursing home beds and delays due to poor internal processes within the wards. Multi-disciplinary working parties were formed to implement six intervention strategies identified by the hospital clinicians. These included: the development of a patient access database and hospital wide alert system for code red status, the design of a pharmacy discharge prescription tracking system, the establishment of a patient discharge lounge, a quality study of the aged care assessment team within the ED and the formation of a transport working group to evaluate an electronic transport booking system within the hospital. Conclusion: In recording the qualitative process involved in gaining hospital clinicians??? perceptions of the problem of access block some indicators of engagement and empowerment were documented. The success of this participatory action approach is based on the simple principal that those that are doing the job are in the best position to change or improve it.</field><field name="date">1995</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Biological oceanography of larval fish diversity and growth off eastern Australia</field><field name="creator">Syahailatua, Augy, BEES, UNSW</field><field name="description">Fish larvae in Australian waters have been studied progressively in the last 2-3 decades including the distribution and abundance of taxa, growth and age, their prey and predators.  However, the effect of nutrient limitation on ichthyoplankton is unstudied, particularly in the oligotrophic Australian waters.  My study was aimed to examine the effect of natural or anthropogenic nutrients on the abundance, distribution, growth and condition of fish larvae along-shore of the NSW coast (latitude 30-34S), where the East Australian Current departs the NSW coast and generates local upwelling of cool nutrient-rich water.  This study shows no significant difference in the total abundance or diversity of either larval fishes amongst the 112 taxa (111 families and 1 order), among regions within or upstream of the upwelling.  However in both months, there were distinctive ichthyoplankton assemblages at the family level.  The Carangidae, Labridae, Lutjanidae, Microcanthidae, Myctophidae and Scombridae were more abundant in the EAC or oceanic water masses, while the Callionymidae, Clupeidae, Platycephalidae, Sillaginidae and Terapontidae were mostly found in the surface or deep upwelled/uplifted water masses.  This pattern is observed in other ichthyoplankton studies and may be a general and useful method to determine mixing of water masses.  Larvae of silver trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) and yellowtail scad (Trachurus novaezelandiae) were generally larger and less abundant in the topographically induced upwelling region, than north of the region in pre-upwelled conditions of the East Australian Current. Both species were mostly at the preflexion stage (less than 4.3 mm in body length and less than 10 days old) in the pre-upwelled conditions, particularly during November, and proportionally more larger and older larvae in the upwelled waters (mostly post-flexion, greater than 4.3 mm in body length and greater than 10 days old).  Ages from sagittal otoliths ranged from 2-25 increments (~days) and exhibited linear growth for both species and months over the size range (3-15 mm standard length).  The otolith radius-length relationship and the growth rates were similar between species and months, despite the 3-4C difference between months.  Overall growth rates of the younger larvae were uniform throughout the entire sampling area (0.5-0.6 mm.d-1), while older larvae grew significantly faster in the upwelled water (0.41 mm.d-1) compared to the non-upwelled conditions (0.34 mm.d-1).  Both species tended to be depleted in 13C in the upwelling region (from ???18.5 to ???19.0), consistent with expected ratios from deeper water, whereas the 15N composition tended to increase in Pseudocaranx, but decrease in Trachurus indicating different diets and possibly trophic level.  The early life history of both species indicates spawning in pre-upwelled waters, but larval transport into upwelled waters is necessary for faster growth in the post-flexion stage. The assemblage of larval fishes did differ between the upwelled region and a region south of Sydney???s deepwater outfalls, but the difference was ascribed to a latitudinal effect and the EAC.  Both larval carangids were enriched in 15N, possibly due to the enriched dissolved organic matter of primary treated sewage. In summary, this study found that the larval fish community can provide a biological means to trace water masses, and estimate their degree of mixing.  Remarkably there was no significant effect of upwelling or sewage addition to the abundance or diversity of larval fish, in the nutrient poor waters of the East Australian Current.  Larval carangids and pilchards were abundant in late spring off northern NSW, and their early life histories were inferred.  Both larval carangid species seem to be spawned in the EAC waters, but as post-flexion larvae grew faster in the upwelled zone.  Pre-flexion (less than 10 day old) larval carangids of both genera indicated spawning in the EAC, and the rarer post-flexion (greater than 10 days old) carangids grew faster in the upwelled waters.  Here, both genera had stable isotope signatures characteristic of upwelled waters for carbon, but had different nitrogen signatures, indicative of different diets and trophic level status.  Larval pilchards actually grew more slowly in the upwelling region, as observed in coastal waters off Japan, and their nursery grounds may be further offshore in the Tasman Front, analogous to their early life history in the Kuroshio Extension.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">biological oceanography</field><field name="subject">ichthyoplankton</field><field name="subject">eastern Australia</field><field name="subject">Tasman Sea</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22791</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Essays on macoroeconomics and macroeconomic forecasting</field><field name="creator">Heidari, Hassan, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation collects three independent essays in the area of Macroeconomics and Macroeconomic forecasting. The first chapter introduces and motivates the three essays. Chapter 2 highlights a serious problem of the Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) models with Litterman???s prior cannot be used to get accurate forecasts of the driftless variables in a mixed drift models. BVAR models with Litterman???s prior, because of the diffuse prior on the constant, do not perform well in the long-run forecasting of I(1) variables either, if they have no drift. This is interesting as in practice most of the macro models include both drift and driftless variables. One solution to this problem is using the Bewley (1979) transformation to impose zero drift to driftless variables in a mixed drift VAR models. A novel feature of this chapter is the use of g-prior in BVAR models to alleviate poor estimation of drift parameters of the Traditional BVAR model. Chapter 3 deals with another possible explanation for the poor performance of the Traditional BVAR models in inflation forecasting. BVAR with Litterman???s prior have the disadvantage of a lack of robustness to deterministic shifts, exacerbated by the ill-determination of the intercept. Several structural break tests show that Australian inflation has breaks in the mean. Chapter 3 uses the Kalman filter to allow parameters to vary over time. The novelty of this chapter is modifying the standard BVAR model, where deterministic components evolve over time. Moreover, this chapter set aside the assumption of diagonality in the prior variance-covariance. Hence, another novelty of this chapter is using a BVAR model with modified non-diagonal variance-covariance matrix similar to the g-prior, where the deterministic components are the only source of variation, to forecast Australian inflation. Chapter 4 moves onto DSGE models and estimates a partially microfunded small-open economy (SOE) New-Keynesian model of the Australian economy. In this chapter, structural parameters of the rest of world (ROW), SOE, and closed economy, are estimated using Australian data as the small economy, and the US as the ROW, with the full information maximum likelihood.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Macroeconomics</field><field name="subject">Macroeconomics -- Forecasting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22800</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A search for transiting extrasolar planets with the automated patrol telescope</field><field name="creator">Hidas, M??rton Gergely, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past decade some 150 planets have been detected outside our Solar System, mostly via precise radial-velocity measurements of their host stars. Using an alternative method, transit searches have recently added 6 planets to the tally, and are expected to make more significant contributions in the future. The transit method is based on the detection of the tiny, periodic dip in the apparent brightness of a star when an orbiting planet passes in front of it. It requires intensive photometric monitoring of ??? 104 stars, with a precision better than ??? 1%. The 0.5 m Automated Patrol Telescope (APT) at Siding Spring Observatory, Australia, with its wide field of view and large aperture, is ideal for this task. This combination is also somewhat unique among telescopes used in transit searches. Since 2001, the APT has been semi-dedicated to a search for extrasolar planets. In this thesis work, observing, data reduction and analysis procedures were developed for the project. A significant fraction of the initial effort was focused on reaching the required photometric precision. This was achieved by implementing a new observing technique, and robust data reduction software. In the first two years of regular observations (starting in August 2002), 8 crowded Galactic fields were monitored, with photometric precision reaching 0.2% for the brightest stars. We searched the lightcurves of the brightest stars (V &amp;lt13) and selected 5 planet candidates. Follow-up photometry and spectroscopy revealed all of these to be eclipsing binary stars. To date, no planets have been detected by this project. A detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the observations, using the currently known frequency and properties of extrasolar planets, resulted in a low calculated detection rate, consistent with the lack of detections. Using this simulation, we have investigated the observational and target star/planet parameters that determine the sensitivity of transit searches. The results highlighted the factors limiting our detection rate, and allowed us to significantly improve our observing strategy. According to the simulations, we should now detect ??? 2 planets per year. This will increase by a factor of a few when a new camera, currently under construction, is installed on the APT in early 2006.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22803</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Improving mobile IP handover latency on end-to -end TCP in UMTS/WCDMA networks</field><field name="creator">Lau, Chee Kong, Electrical Engineering &amp; Telecommunications, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Due to terminal mobility and change of service area, efficient IP mobility support is an important aspect in UMTS networks in order to provide mobile users negligible packet loss rate and low handover latency, and thus some level of guaranteed quality-ofservice (QoS) to support real-time applications. 3G/UMTS has been specified and implemented as an end-to-end mobile communications system. The underlying WCDMA access systems manage radio access handover (layer 1) and provide linklayer mobility (layer 2) in terms of connection setup and resource management. For the UMTS nodes to have seamless connectivity with the Internet, the UMTS core networks need to be able to support continuous and no network service session handover (layer 3 and above). A long IP handover latency results in high packet loss rate and severely degrades its end-to-end transport level performance. Network-layer handover latency has therefore been regarded as one of the fundamental limitations in IP-based UMTS networks. Therefore, it is crucial to provide efficient network-layer mobility management in UMTS/WCDMA networks for seamless end-to-end TCP connection with the global Internet.  Mobility of UMTS nodes necessitates extra functionalities such as user location tracking, address registration and handover related mechanisms. The challenge to provide seamless mobility in UMTS requires localised location management and efficient IP handover management. Mobile IPv6 protocol offers a better mobility support as the extended IPv6 features with mobility mechanism are integrated to the mobile nodes. To mitigate the effect of lengthy IP handover latency, two well-known handover reducing mechanisms based on Mobile IPv6 support have been proposed in the literature. They are designed with hierarchical network management and address pre-configuration mechanism. Hierarchical management aims to reduce the network registration time, and fast-handover attempts to minimise the address resolution delay. S-MIP (Seamless Mobile IP) integrates the key benefits of the above IP mobility mechanisms coupled with local retransmission scheme to achieve packet lossless and extremely low handover latency, operating in WLAN environments.  In this thesis, we explore the possible Mobile IP solutions and various IP handover optimisation schemes in IPv6 to provide seamless mobility in UMTS with the global Internet. It aims at developing an optimised handover scheme that encompasses the packet lossless and extremely low handover latency scheme in S-MIP, and applying it into the UMTS/WCDMA packet data domain. Therefore, the hybrid UMTS-SMIP architecture is able to meet the requirements of delay sensitive real-time applications requiring strict delay bound, packet lossless and low handover latency performance for end-to-end TCP connection during a UMTS IP-based handover. The overall seamless handover architecture in UMTS facilitates integrated, scalable and flexible global IP handover solution enabling new services, assuring service quality and meeting the user???s expectations in future all-IP UMTS deployment. The viability of the seamless mobility scheme in UMTS is reflected through and validated in our design model, network protocol implementation, and service architecture. We illustrate the performance gained in QoS parameters, as a result of converged UMTS-SMIP framework compared to other Mobile IPv6 variants. The simulation results show such a viable and promising seamless handover scheme in UMTS on IP handover latency reduction on its end-to-end TCP connection.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile IPv6; Seamless Mobility; IP Handover; UMTS/WCDMA.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/22806</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Long-term outcomes after severe, traumatic brain injury</field><field name="creator">Hill, Heather B, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Predominant theories regarding adjustment and adaptation from the 1960s to mid 1980 are examined. Medical literature relating to outcomes after traumatic brain injury is examined. The gloom in major texts is surprising. The lack of definition of the commonly used term ???long-term??? is discussed. The relative lack of research to guide advice about very long-term prognoses remains a major concern. There are a number of ways of defining reality. Some come from an observer???s view of a person???s life. Some come from the reports of a significant other in the life of the person with TBI. Others come from the words or writings of the person who sustained a serious TBI. Quantitative research excels at summarising data and reaching generalisations based on statistical projections. Qualitative research excels at telling the story from the person???s viewpoint, providing the rich descriptive detail that sets quantitative results into their human context. An opportunistic sample of people who suffered a very severe TBI in 1981 was traced and narratives of their experiences since their injury obtained, either written or converted to text from interview. The texts were analysed using a qualitative technique based on grounded theory. The results of the analysis, the fact that a variety of approaches were used by people to deal with their problems, possible reasons for negative prognoses, and the limitations of the study are highlighted.

The  fact  that  the  Malaysian  school  system  has  offered  school  music  since  1983  with  very  few  attempts  to  understand  the  impact of  this  subject  among  the  children  themselves  highlights  the  need  for  investigations  which  can  clarify  the  extent  to  which  school  music  education  has  influenced  children???s  perceptions  of  learning  music.   The  purpose  of  this  dissertation  was  to  examine  the  personal  and  external  factors,  which  help  shape  Malaysian  children???s  valuing  for  the  formal  learning  of  music  both  in  and  out  of  school.   Surveys  of  1,060  primary  school  children  aged  9  to  12,  as  well  as  interviews  with  a  smaller  sample  of  music  learners,  were  undertaken  to  investigate  children???s  motivation  to  learn  music.  The  Expectancy???Value  theory  of  Jacquelynne  Eccles  and  Allan  Wigfield  acted  as  a  framework  to  investigate  motivational  constructs  dealing  with  ttainment,  intrinsic  interest,  and  utility  values,  in  addition  to  the  cost  factor  related  to  learning  music.   In  the  first  part  of  the  analyses,  survey  results  were  categorized  according  to  the  three  main  ethnic  groups  in  Malaysia,  subdivided  into  five  ethnic???religion  groups  (i.e.,  Malay  Muslims,  Chinese  Buddhists,  Chinese  Christians,  Indian  Hindus  and  Indian  Christians),  musical  experience  (learners,  non???learners  and  those  who  had  ceased  learning)  and  gender.   The  second  part  of  the  analyses  focused  on  the   responses  of  20  music  learners  in  order  to  enrich  the  data  obtained  in  the  first  part  of  the  analyses.  Results  revealed  that  most  children,  regardless  of  ethnicity,  were  intrinsically  motivated  to  learn  music  in  school.   Moderately  high  perceptions  of  enjoyment  and  interest,  as  well  as  recognition  for  music???s  utility  value  were  prominent  among  all  ethnic  groups.   However,  most  children,  regardless  of  ethnicity,  musical  experience  and  gender  did  not  perceive  learning  music  in  and  out  of  school  as  having  high  attainment  value,  with  a  majority  indicating  moderately  low  responses  for  the  importance  of  learning  music.   Differences  among  ethnic  groups  revealed  that  Chinese  and  Indian  children  perceived  the  utility  value  of  musical  training  mor  than  Malay  children,  who  were  also  more  inclined  to  perceive  learning  music  as  difficult  and  involving  more  cost.   Significant  differences  for  gender  also  revealed  that  girls  recognize  more  intrinsic  and  utility  value  of  learning  music  bothin  and  outside  school.

The Utility Industry has used GIS software to place their assets relative to these digital cadastres, and are now finding their assets placed incorrectly when viewed against these upgraded digital cadastres. This thesis examines the processes developed in the software program called the ???Spatial Adjustment Engine???, and documents a holistic approach to semi-automating the upgrading of the digital cadastre and the subsequent upgrading of the utility assets. This thesis also documents the various pilot projects undertaken during the development of the Spatial Adjustment Engine, the topological scenarios found in each pilot, their solution, and provides a framework of definitions needed to explore this field further. The results of each pilot project are given in context, and lead to the conclusions. The conclusions indicate the processes and procedures implemented in the Spatial Adjustment Engine are a suitable mechanism for the upgrade of digital cadastre and of spatially dependant themes such as utility assets, zoning themes, annotation layers, and some road centreline themes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">parametric least squares adjustment</field><field name="subject">GIS</field><field name="subject">spatial upgrade</field><field name="subject">relative position</field><field name="subject">absolute position</field><field name="subject">spatial adjustment engine</field><field name="subject">SAE</field><field name="subject">digital cadastre</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23003</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Smokescreen : black/white/male/female bravery and southeast Australian bushfires</field><field name="creator">Finlay, Christine, School of Sociology &amp; Anthropology, UNSW</field><field name="description">Black/white/male/female struggles over knowledge correctness and who is brave are examined inductively in the field of bushfires. The paradoxes of a white male icon are linked to contradictions in gender theories in disaster. In mainstream literature, assumptions of innate white male superiority in bravery justify white women???s diminution and white male domination. In feminist theory, women???s diminution is the problem and their bravery for struggling against hegemony applauded. Philosophies of bravery are explored in 104 semistructured interviews and 12 months??? fieldwork as a volunteer bushfirefighter. There is great variety in the ways volunteers cope with bushfires. However, evidence of white male hegemony emerges when volunteers complain of state and territory indifference to preventing property and environmental damage and injury and death. Evidence is examined that Indigenous Australians once managed bushfires better than a sprawl of bureaucracy. Bushfire service claims that Aborigines knew nothing about hazard reductions are contradicted. This debate over bushfire management leads to the discovery of a third epistemology breaking with claims of white male iconic bravery and bureaucratic mastery. To generalise about the habitus of claims to knowledge and bravery, I analyse Newcastle Herald articles from 1881-1981. Three competing knowledge fields and their associated struggles are examined; Indigenous Australians and white womens??? emancipatory struggles confront data on bushfirefighting. Bushfires emerge as a serious problem, a bureaucratic power base and a white male icon from the 1920s.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Forest fires - Australia</field><field name="subject">Forest fighters - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The conservation and management of small mammals and lizards in a disturbed forest ecosystem</field><field name="creator">Penn, Angela Mary, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">The conservation of biological diversity has become one of the most important goals of managing forests in an ecologically sustainable way. In this thesis, I report a comprehensive study designed to examine the long-term effects of commercial logging and high-intensity fire, and the ability of Population Viability Analysis (PVA) models to predict these effects to aid in the conservation and management of multiple species. Initially, I compared the abundance of small mammals (A. agilis, R. fuscipes, A. swainsonii), and lizards (L. delicata, L. guichenoti, E. heatwolei), in sites with different disturbance histories: 18-19 yearold logging regrowth, 28-29 or 33-34 year???old clearfelling regrowth and unlogged forest. All sites had previously been burnt by bushfires. No evidence of long-term effects of logging or fire was found for A. agilis, R. fuscipes, L. delicata or L. guichenoti, and there were not enough data to make conclusions for A. swainsonii and E. heatwolei. Then the effects of a hazard-reduction burn were investigated. There was variation between the species in the effects of the burn, with interactions between year, aspect and burning for A. agilis and R. fuscipes, and interactions between year, disturbance and topography for the Lampropholis species. A. swainsonii became extremely scarce in the forest after the burn and E. heatwolei were generally unaffected. Next, PVA metapopulation models were used to predict the likely abundance and patch occupancy of these species based on historical data. Retrospective testing showed the models were accurate for all species, but best for A. agilis and R. fuscipes. Lastly, PVA modelling was used to rank management options; no management action, a hazard-reduction burn in 2005 or a logging event in 2005. The models predicted that future management is likely to result in the extinction of A. agilis, R. fuscipes and L. guichenoti by 2010. However, no one management scenario was most detrimental to all species. The current management regime for this forest involves commercial logging on a 40-year cycle and regular hazard-reduction burning. PVA modelling predicts that A. swainsonii and L. delicata are at the greatest risk of extinction under this regime, but that it is also likely to lead to the extinction of A. agilis, R. fuscipes and L. guichenoti in the near future. The results of this research indicate that the conservation of multiple species under one management regime is unlikely to be successful.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">logging</field><field name="subject">environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">mammals</field><field name="subject">ecology</field><field name="subject">lizards</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23012</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Metal complex catalysed C-X (X = S, O and N) bond formation</field><field name="creator">Vuong, Khuong Quoc, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the catalysed addition of X-H bonds (X = S, O and N) to alkynes using a range of novel rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes containing hybrid bidentate phosphine-pyrazolyl, phosphine-imidazolyl and phosphine-N heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donor ligands. The synthesis of novel bidentate phosphine-pyrazolyl, phosphine-imidazolyl (P-N) and phosphine-NHC (PC) donor ligands and their cationic and neutral rhodium(I) and iridium(I) complexes [M(P N)(COD)]BPh4, [M(PC)(COD)]BPh4, [Ir(P-N)(CO)2]BPh4 and [M(P-N)(CO)Cl] were successfully performed. An unusual five coordinate iridium complex with phosphine-NHC ligands [Ir(PC)(COD)(CO)]BPh4 was also obtained. Seventeen single crystal X-ray structures of these new complexes were determined. A range of these novel rhodium and iridium complexes were effective as catalysts for the addition of thiophenol to a variety of alkynes. Iridium complexes were more effective than rhodium analogues. Cationic complexes were more effective than neutral complexes. Complexes with hybrid phosphine-nitrogen donor were more effective than complexes containing bidentate nitrogen donor ligands. An atom-economical, efficient method for the synthesis of cyclic acetals and bicyclic O,O-acetals was successfully developed based on the catalysed hydroalkoxylation. Readily prepared terminal and non-terminal alkyne diols were cyclised into bicyclic O,O-acetals in quantitative conversions in most cases. The efficiency of a range of rhodium and iridium complexes containing bidentate P-N and PC donor ligands as catalysts for the cyclisation of 4-pentyn-1-amine to 2-methyl-1-pyrroline varied significantly. The cationic iridium complexes with the bidentate phosphine-pyrazolyl ligands, [Ir(R2PyP)(COD)]BPh4 (2.39-2.42) were extremely efficient as catalysts for this transformation. Increasing the size of the substituent on or adjacent to the donor led to improvement in catalytic activity of the corresponding metal complexes. The mechanism of the catalysed hydroalkoxylation was proposed to proceed by the initial activation of the alkyne via ?? coordination to the metal centre. The ?? binding of both aliphatic and aromatic alkynes to [Ir(PyP)(CO)2]BPh4 (2.44) was observed by low temperature NMR and no reaction between 2.44 and alcohols was observed. In contrast, the facility in which thiol and amine oxidatively added to 2.44 led the proposal that in the hydrothiolation and hydroamination reaction, the catalytic cycle commences with the activation of the X-H bond (X = S, N) by an oxidative addition process.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">homegeneous catalysis</field><field name="subject">hybrid ligands</field><field name="subject">P-N ligands</field><field name="subject">NHC ligands</field><field name="subject">hydroamination</field><field name="subject">hydroalkoxylation</field><field name="subject">hydrothiolation</field><field name="subject">spiroketals</field><field name="subject">rhodium catalysts</field><field name="subject">iridium catalysts</field><field name="subject">metal complexes</field><field name="subject">alkynes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23015</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A dialogue: Hobbes and his perception of the role and development of the common law</field><field name="creator">Milgate, Michael Andrew, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis has three parts. The purpose of the first part is to analyse the origin, general characteristics, context and meaning of A Dialogue. I also include a history of the editions of this work, and a discussion on how the scholars have understood it. My intention is to explore the possibility of adding to their comments some additional reasons for Hobbes??? intentions in writing A Dialogue. In order to do all this, I have to take into account two main questions: ??? First, the relation between Hobbes (his life, ideas, aspirations, enemies) and A Dialogue; and ??? Second, the specific problem posed to Hobbes by common law. These issues correspond to the three chapters of Part One of the thesis. The second part of the thesis is divided into nine chapters; it analysis the content of A Dialogue section by section, trying to explain Hobbes??? interpretation of English law and legal history. According to Hobbes, an analysis of the rational principles expressed by both common and civil (Roman) law in England shows the indivisible nature of sovereignty. History, supposedly, confirms this. In the third part of the thesis I locate Hobbes??? legal philosophy as a science, according to the same deductive principles, which he states, are applied to geometry. Hobbes intends to make jurisprudence a form of scientific knowledge to reinforce the idea that sovereignty cannot be shared. While pursuing this philosophical enterprise, Hobbes wants to square his science of politics with English legal history. Hobbes argues that in England, except for the period during the civil wars, there has always been only one absolute ruler of the country. By taking this stand, Hobbes, indirectly calls for changes in the English constitutional order, to be made by advocating the authority of the past, and not only by advocating the application of reason.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">common law</field><field name="subject">Thomas Hobbes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23053</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Ion exchange equilibria of the gold cyanide complex in aqueous and mixed solvent environments</field><field name="creator">Jayasinghe, Nivari, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Ion exchange equilibria are presented for [ ]??? ??? Au(CN)2 / Cl , [ ]??? ??? Au(CN)2 / SCN and SCN??? / Cl??? in aqueous solution, and in various mixed solvents, at 303K using Purolite A500 as the ion-exchanger. The mixed solvents investigated include water-acetone, water-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and water-N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). In aqueous solution, the selectivity of Purolite A500 for a given anion increases in the order: [ ]??? ??? &amp;lt ??? &amp;lt Cl SCN Au(CN)2 . This selectivity sequence confirms the high affinity of the ion exchange resin for the [ ]??? Au(CN)2 species. In mixed solvents, however, the selectivity of Purolite A500 for [ ]??? Au(CN)2 decreases with an increase in the composition of the organic solvent in the external solution. Mixed solvents containing greater than 60 mol% organic solvent are preferred for the displacement of [ ]??? Au(CN)2 from the resin. The effectiveness of a given type of mixed solvent generally increases in the following order: DMSO &amp;it acetone &amp;it NMP. The ion exchange equilibria are correlated using the Law of Mass Action, modified with activity coefficients, to determine the equilibrium constant for each binary system. The fitted values of the equilibrium constants are consistent with the trends observed in the ion exchange isotherms. The accuracy of the correlation results in the mixed solvent systems range from 1 to 10% and this is similar to the level of accuracy obtained for the ion exchange equilibria in aqueous solution. From these results it can be concluded that the Law of Mass Action is equally valid in mixed solvent systems. The variation in the equilibrium constant with mixed solvent composition, for a given binary system, correlates well with the dielectric constant of the mixed solvent. For a given value of the dielectric constant, however, the equilibrium constant, however, the equilibrium constant is dependent on the type of mixed solvent. A fundamental relationship is derived between the equilibrium constants and the Gibbs energies of transfer associated with the solvation of the ions in the mixed solvents. Based on this relationship, the redistribution of ions between the pore solution and the bulk mixed solvent, appears to be the most significant factor that governs the selectivity of the resin in mixed solvent systems.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gold</field><field name="subject">cyanide proces</field><field name="subject">ion exchange resins</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23056</field></doc><doc><field name="title">High efficiency metal stencil printed silicon solar cells</field><field name="creator">Yao, Guoxiao, Centre for Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis work demonstrates the feasibility to fabricate high-efficiency crystalline silicon solar cells by using metal stencil printing technique to replace screen printing or electroless plating techniques for implementing crystalline silicon solar cell front metallization. The developed laser-cut stainless steel stencils successfully challenge two of the cell performance limitations associated with commercial screen printing technology: the wide and non-uniform front gridline fingers and low height-to-width aspect ratio of the fingers. These limitations lower the short circuit current density, the fill factor and, in turn, the efficiency of a screen printed solar cell. Metal stencils are capable of printing fine, high and continuous features on the cell front that have a high aspect ratio. Both single-level and double-level structured stainless steel stencils for solar cell front metallization have been developed, with laser-cut double-level stainless steel stencils being demonstrated for the first time worldwide. Both of them are able to print fine, high and continuous gridline pattern to the front surfaces of solar cells in one step, with a certain number of special short bridges being put at the places where fingers meet busbar and along fingers and busbar. The deformation issue of the very thin stainless steel foils due to its thermal expansion in the process of laser cutting is solved by increasing the energy content in each laser pulse that impinges upon the stainless steel foil with changed Q-switch frequencies, while maintaining the laser average output energy in unit time to an optimum value. A chemical etching process has been developed to etch the dross that results from laser cutting, resulting in well formed metal stencils suitable for printing. By a comparison between the metal stencil printed and conventional mesh screen printed silicon solar cells, which are fabricated on similar Cz silicon wafers with a almost identical cell processing sequence except for using different front contact printing masks, the following conclusions are reached: Fired Ag finger lines with 75-??m width on finished solar cells, using a doublelevel stainless steel stencil can be achieved. In contrast, the fired Ag finger line on finished solar cells using a traditional mesh screen is 121-??m wide. The stencil printed finger is smoother and more uniform than by screen printing and the former has a 25-??m fired finger height with a 0.33 height-to-width aspect ratio, compared to a 10-??m fired finger height with a 0.08 height-to-width aspect ratio for the later. With these advantages, the 4-cm2 stencil-printed silicon solar cells has an averaged 1.28 mA/cm2 higher short circuit current and an averaged 5.9% higher efficiency than the 4-cm2 screen printed silicon solar cell, which identifies one of the key advantages of solar cell metallization schemes by using metal stencil printing in place of screen printing. Using a ???feedback alignment??? method for registration of the laser-formed metal stencil printed pattern and the laser-formed groove pattern, Ag paste can be printed and filled into wafer grooves by using a hand-operated without an optical vision system. The fired finger profile is 50-??m wide and 22-??m high. The best metal stencil printed, selective emitter silicon solar cell demonstrates a 34.2 mA/cm2 short circuit current density, 625 mV open circuit voltage, 0.77 fill factor and 16.4% efficiency, with an excellent spectral response at short wavelengths due to its selective emitter cell structure. It is believed that the performance of this type of solar cell can be enhanced with a screen printer that has an optical vision system and an automatic alignment device. The successful development of metal stencil printed silicon solar cells demonstrates the feasibility of the metal stencil printing as a beneficial technology for the PV industry.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23062</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Theoretical and experimental study of energy selective contacts for hot carrier solar cells and extensions to tandem cells</field><field name="creator">Jiang, Chu-Wei, School of Photovoltaic Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Photovoltaics is currently the fastest growing energy source in the world. Increasing the conversion efficiency towards the thermodynamic limits is the trend in research development. ???Third generation??? photovoltaics involves the investigation of ideas that may achieve this goal. Among the third generation concepts, the tandem cell structure has experimentally proven to have conversion efficiencies higher than a standard p-n junction solar cell. The alternative hot carrier solar cell design is one of the most elegant approaches. Energy selective contacts are crucial elements for the operation of hot carrier solar cells. Besides the carrier cooling problem within the absorber, carrier extraction has to be done through a narrow range of energy to minimise the interaction between the hot carriers in the absorber and the cooler carriers in the contacts. Resonant tunnelling through localised states, such as associated with atomic defects or with quantum dots in a dielectric matrix, may provide the required energy selectivity. A new model in studying the properties of resonant tunnelling through defects in an insulator is proposed and investigated. The resulting calculations are simple and useful in obtaining physical insight into the underlying tunneling processes. It is found that defects having a normal distribution along the tunnelling direction do not reduce the transmission coefficient dramatically, which increases the engineering prospects for fabrication. Silicon quantum dots embedded in an oxide provide the required deep energy confinement for room temperature resonant tunnelling operation. A single layer of silicon quantum dots in the centre of an oxide matrix are prepared by RF magnetron sputtering. The method has the advantage of controlling the dot size and the dot spatial position along the tunnelling direction. The presence of these crystalline silicon dots in the oxide is confirmed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). A negative-differential resistance characteristic has been measured at room temperature on such structures fabricated on an N-type degenerated silicon wafer, a feature that can be explained by the desired resonant tunnelling process. A silicon quantum dot superlattice can be made by stacking multiple layers of silicon quantum dots. A model is proposed for calculating the band structure of such a silicon quantum dot superlattice, with the anisotropic silicon effective mass being taken into account. It suggests a high density of silicon quantum dots in a carbide matrix may provide the bandgap and required mobility for the top cell in the stacks for the recently proposed all-silicon tandem solar cell. The resonant tunnelling modeling and silicon quantum dot experiments developed have demonstrated new results relevant to energy selective contacts for hot carrier solar cells. Building on this work, the modeling study on silicon quantum dots may provide the theoretical basis for bandgap engineering of all-silicon tandem cells.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">photovoltaic cells</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23065</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Catalytic distillation for the synthesis of tertiary butyl alcohol</field><field name="creator">Safinski, Tomasz, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Catalytic Distillation for the synthesis of tertiary butyl alcohol (TBA) is investigated in this thesis. The solvent, ethylene glycol, is proposed as a means of overcoming challenges, which limit the potential benefits of the application of reactive separation for TBA. The proposed action of the solvent is that of extractive distillation entrainer, thus a new unit operation of Catalytic Extractive Distillation (CED) is suggested. The solubility of isobutylene in water, TBA, and ethylene glycol and their binary and ternary mixtures, at different temperatures, is measured and correlated. The solubility is found to be highly non-linear in solutions containing TBA. The kinetics of isobutylene hydration over Amberlyst 15 is characterised in the presence of ethylene glycol. The solvent is found to promote reaction rate, however it is also found to compete for reaction with isobutylene. Water is found to strongly inhibit the reaction of ethylene glycol and isobutylene. The selectivity ratio of TBA to by products is determined and found to improve with increased temperature and lower solvent concentration. Bale packing is chosen as catalytic distillation hardware for the containment of Amberlyst 15 and its two-phase fluid dynamics characterised for the first time. Raschig rings are used as a benchmark for the study. Bale packing is found to exhibit two ranges of backmixing behaviour in the pre-loading regime. This behaviour is attributed to the three levels of porosity of the hardware and indicative of low rates of catalyst/liquid renewal. The effectiveness of ethylene glycol as extractive distillation entrainer for the separation of the TBA/water azeotrope over Bale packing is investigated and the solvent found to be highly effective. The mass transfer resistances to isobutylene transport are determined for countercurrent fixed bed reactor (CFBR) application of Bale packing. It is found that ethylene glycol improves mass transfer coefficients attainable. Catalytic Extractive Distillation is implemented over Bale packing and the ability of the solvent to improve reaction rates and purity of TBA demonstrated. However, the reaction rates achieved have much scope for improvement through increased isobutylene availability. In response to poor liquid renewal of static packing such as Bale packing and the necessity of improved isobutylene transport a new form of catalytic distillation reactor design is proposed, the Basket Impeller Column (BIC). The BIC combines the mass transfer benefits of a rotating basket reactor with that of a dual flow column. Capacity of the new hardware is determined and correlated. Separation and reactive separation are demonstrated to be feasible. It is found that Damk??hler number can be varied directly using the additional process variable of speed of rotation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">butanol</field><field name="subject">distillation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23068</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The multiple experiences of migrancy, Irishness and home among contemporary Irish immigrants in Melbourne, Australia</field><field name="creator">O???Connor, Patricia Mary, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines the experiences of post-1980 Irish immigrants in Australia using Greater Melbourne as a case study. It has three main but interrelated objectives. Firstly, it establishes the origins, characteristics, dynamics and outcomes of contemporary Irish migration to Australia. Secondly, it explores informants??? multiple experiences of Irishness in both Ireland and Australia. Thirdly, it examines how migrancy and identity issues were related to informants??? sense of belonging and home. Identity is approached in this study from a constructivist perspective. Accordingly, identity is conceptualised as dynamic, subject to situational stimuli and existing in juxtaposition to a constructed ???other???. Prior to migration, a North/South, Protestant/Catholic ???other??? provided the bases for identity constructions in Ireland. The experiences of immigrants from both Northern and Southern Ireland are examined so that the multiple pre- and post-migration experiences of Irishness can be captured. Face-to-face interviews with 203 immigrants provide the study???s primary data. Migration motivation was found to be multifactorial and contained a strong element of adventure. Informal chain migration, based on relationship linkages in Australia, was important in directing flows and meeting immigrants??? post-arrival accommodation needs. Only 28 percent of the sample initially saw their move as permanent and onethird were category jumpers. A consolidation of Irish identity occurred post-migration. This was most pronounced among Northern Protestants and was largely predicated on informants??? perceptions of how Britishness and Irishness were constructed in Australia. For Northern respondents, the freedom to express Irishness may have masked an enforced Irishness that evolved in response to perceived negative constructions of Britishness, and their experiences of homogenisation with Southern immigrants. Hierarchies within white privilege in Australia, based on origin and accent, were indicated by the study findings. Movement and identity were related through the transnational practices of informants. Separation from familial and friendship networks prompted high levels of return visitation and telephone contact with their homeland, establishing the group as a highly transnational in relational terms. Examining the experiences of this invisible immigrant group through a constructionist lens contributed to the broader understanding of whiteness, transnationalism and the Irish diaspora generally.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Irish Australia</field><field name="subject">Ireland emigration and immigration</field><field name="subject">Australia emigration and immigration</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23071</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market reaction to audit opinions of companies listed on the Shanghai stock exchange</field><field name="creator">Wang, Yi, Accounting, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study extends research on the information content of qualified audit opinions in more developed markets to the emerging capital market in China. It investigates the market reaction to audit opinions of listed Chinese companies on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A sample of 3128 company/year observations was included, with 386 modified audit opinions and 2742 unqualified audit opinions during the investigation period 1999 to 2003. The variable of interest is audit opinions. Control variables include those used in studies of developed countries, such as earnings surprise, concurrent bad news disclosure, audit report delay, leverage, the presence of loss and firm size. Also included are variables controlling for specific Chinese institutional characteristics, such as ???special treatment???, as well as bull and bear market indicators. When all modified audit opinions are combined, this study does not find evidence that the modified audit opinions have significant information value to Chinese investors. However, when modified audit opinions are classified by type, the market is found to significantly react to qualified audit opinions with explanatory notes and disclaimer audit opinions, which are the severest audit opinions investigated in this study. When the entire sample is partitioned by year, a significant stock price revision to modified audit opinions is documented in 2003. This study also examined in the Chinese context the Melumad and Ziv (1997) model of stock price response to avoidable and unavoidable modified audit opinions. Consistent with Melumad and Ziv (1997) predictions, the market reaction to avoidable audit reports is unclear, while investors view unavoidable audit reports as necessarily negative information. In conclusion, this study finds mixed evidence in support of the notion that the Chinese stock market views audit opinions as valuable information.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23021</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Contingent corporate governance: a challenge to universal theories of board structure</field><field name="creator">Rogers, Meredith, Australian Graduate School of Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Agency theory proposes that the role of the board of directors is to control management (Fama &amp; Jensen 1983). A structurally independent board, one with a high percentage of non-executive directors and a chairperson who is not the CEO, has been used as a proxy for the control role. Therefore, agency theory predicts a positive relationship between independent board structure and firm performance. These predictions have not been confirmed by meta-analytic reviews (Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand, &amp; Johnson 1998; Rhoades, Rechner, &amp; Sundaramurthy 2000). This thesis applies structural contingency theory to provide an alternative explanation for the relationship between board structure and firm performance. Structural contingency theory (Donaldson 2001) proposes that the relationship between an organization???s structure and its performance is moderated by contingencies. In this study the contingency is the salience of the board???s control role. I argue that structural independence of the board has a beneficial effect on performance only if it is in fit with control salience. For example, a firm with an independently structured board that gives high prominence to the control role will perform well. On the other hand, another firm with a less independently structured board that does not see its main role as controlling management will also prosper. Survey data were analyzed to measure the control salience for 98 Australian listed companies. Archival data provided measures of board structure and firm performance. Consistent with the meta-analytic reviews, there was no association between independent board structure and firm performance. There was some evidence that high control salience resulted in high performance, but this effect was evident chiefly when performance was measured by total shareholder returns.

This thesis evaluates the service demand, accessibility, utilisation, and coverage of Australia???s first DCR, the Sydney Medically Supervised Injecting Centre (MSIC), located in an area with a history of illegal shooting gallery operation. MSIC impact on injecting practices and injecting related health, and referral to drug treatment were also examined. Methods included cross-sectional IDU surveys, key informant interviews, staff focus groups, analysis of client registration and surveillance data and routinely collected data on needles and syringes - including multiple indirect prevalence estimation, and prospective follow-up of MSIC referrals. Shooting gallery users expressed demand for and willingness to use the MSIC. Injecting episodes previously occurring in shooting galleries appear to have been transferred to the MSIC, although shooting galleries continued to operate at a reduced level. The MSIC service model was accessible, with few refusals of entry, high levels of client satisfaction and limited non-use for reasons relating to the model. MSIC engaged high risk IDUs - regular injectors, sex workers, and those injecting in public places and shooting galleries - who were also more likely to be frequent attendees. MSIC clients were more likely than other IDUs to inject in public places and shooting galleries, be HCV seropositive, have riskier injecting practices and more severe injecting related health problems. MSIC achieved good coverage of the local IDU population (70.7%, range 59.1%-86.7%) and modest coverage of their estimated total injecting episodes during its operating hours (8.8%, range 7.3%-10.8%). MSIC use was associated with improvements in injecting practices and health. Frequent MSIC use was also associated with higher rates of referral to drug treatment than less frequent use. Drug treatment referral uptake was positively associated with a recent history of daily injection and sex work and negatively associated with a lifetime history of psychiatric treatment and/or self harm. This research was confounded by substantial changes in heroin availability during the study period but provides new evidence on DCR coverage, impact on injecting practices and health, and referral to drug treatment. Implications for future research are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Narcotics addicts - Services for - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="subject">Injections, Intravenous - Health aspects - New South Wales - Sydney</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23038</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Role of resistant starch and probiotics in colon inflammation</field><field name="creator">Amansec, Sarah Gracielle, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">An imbalance of the T cell immune response is observed in inflammatory bowel disease. Intestinal microbes have been linked to the disease and the disease process leads to severe mucosal injury and systemic translocation of bacterial products. Aminosalicylates, corticosteroids and immunomodulators reduce these aggressive activities but are associated with potentially serious adverse events. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of administration of prebiotics and probiotics that modulate the gut microflora and modulate the immune response, in ameliorating severity of colitis. The prebiotic, high amylose maize resistant starch was used at two different concentrations. A number of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains were used as probiotics. BALB/c mice were administered the prebiotics and probiotics and intrarectally infused with 2.5 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in 45% ethanol, thereby generating colitis. Mucosal cytokine responses, colonic microbial profiles and disease activity indices were monitored. The 5% concentration of high amylose maize resistant starch delayed progression of TNBS colitis as evidenced by reduced weight loss, lesser tissue damage, abrogation of the expression and synthesis of IFN-?? and upregulation of IL-4 and IL-10. The 30% concentration of high amylose maize resistant starch exacerbated the inflammatory response with an increase in acetic acid, coliforms and endopores in the colonic contents. Three strains of bifidobacteria and 3 strains of lactobacilli were individually screened for their activity against TNBS colitis. Each strain had a distinctive effect on the course of colon inflammation. Lactobacillus fermentum VRI 003 was selected for further study as it provided most protection. The ratio of immunosuppressive cytokines to pro-inflammatory cytokines was restored closer to the normal T cell cytokine levels. It also reduced the incidence of translocation of enteric bacteria into the spleens.  Dosing a minimum daily dose of 6x109 CFU L. fermentum VRI-003 to ulcerative colitis patients in remission and maintained on standard therapy for 6 months prevented the exacerbation of symptoms, including diarrhea and abdominal pain, and improved the patient general well being. It also suppressed production of IFN-?? and sustained IL-10 levels. Moreover, absence of endospores and lower numbers of coliforms were detected in the faeces of UC patients during L. fermentum VRI-003 treatment. In summary, 5% high amylose maize resistant starch and L. fermentum VRI 003 prevented colon inflammation by changing the nature of the T cell immune response and modifying the colonic microflora in the murine model. The clinical evidence supported these findings.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Inflammatory bowel diseases</field><field name="subject">Bacteria - Health aspects</field><field name="subject">T cells</field><field name="subject">Starch</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23041</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Don DeLillo's promiscuous fictions:the adulterous triangle of sex, space, and language</field><field name="creator">Jenkins, Diana Marie, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis takes up J. G. Ballard's contention, that 'the act of intercourse is now always a model for something else,' to show that Don DeLillo uses a particular sexual, cultural economy of adultery, understood in its many loaded cultural and literary contexts, as a model for semantic reproduction. I contend that DeLillo's fiction evinces a promiscuous model of language that structurally reflects the myth of the adulterous triangle. The thesis makes a significant intervention into DeLillo scholarship by challenging Paul Maltby's suggestion that DeLillo's linguistic model is Romantic and pure. My analysis of the narrative operations of adultery in his work reveals the alternative promiscuous model. I discuss ten DeLillo novels and one play - Americana, Players, The Names, White Noise, Libra, Mao II,Underworld, the play Valparaiso, The Body Artist, Cosmopolis, and the pseudonymousAmazons - that feature adultery narratives. I demonstrate that these narratives resist conservative models of language, space, and sex by using promiscuity as a method of narrative control. I argue that DeLillo's adultery narratives respond subversively to attempts to categorise his work, and that he extends the mythologised rhetoric of the adulterous triangle by adopting sexual transgression as a three-sided semantic structure that connects language, sex, and space. I refer to theories of narrative, postmodernity, space, desire, and parody to show that DeLillo's adultery narratives structurally influence his experiments with linguistic meaning. My analysis reveals that contradiction performs at several spatial, sexual, and dialogical levels to undermine readings that suggest DeLillo's language models pure meaning. I identify the sexualised fissure within DeLillo's semantic style that is exposed by the operation of contradiction. I believe this gap distinguishes DeLillo from postmodern fiction's emphasis on the placeless, because it is a meaningful space that emphasises the reproductive adulteration of signification. I expose several sites of dialectic rupture, including the hotel/motel room, oppositional and metaphorical description, the journey, the image, and the secret. I contend that sex in these transgressive narratives is a model for something else: promiscuous meaning. This thesis demonstrates that DeLillo's fiction charts the typography of the mythical third side of the adulterous triangle in order to respond to language's own promiscuity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DeLillo, Don - Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Adultery in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Protein engineering of DNA polymerase I: thioredoxin dependent processivity</field><field name="creator">Chiu, Joyce, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">DNA polymerases are found in a diverse range of organisms, prokaryotes, eukaryotes, viruses and bacteriophage. T7 DNA polymerase is a replicative enzyme from E. coli bacteriophage T7. It relies on the thioredoxin binding domain (TBD) of phage gene 5 protein (gp5) and E. coli thioredoxin (Trx) for processive replication of phage DNA. Although T7 DNA polymerase is processive, it is also thermolabile. In order to design a thermostable and processive DNA polymerase, the structural stabilities of the TBD and Trx were studied in respect to their binding affinity and affect on enzyme processivity. An artificial operon was designed for coexpression of subunits of T7 DNA polymerase. By means of a 9??His-tag at the amino terminus of gp5, T7 DNA polymerase complex was purified by one-step nickel-agarose chromatography, with subunits gp5 and Trx co-eluting in a one to one molar ratio. Purified T7 DNA polymerase was assayed for polymerase activity, processivity and residual activity and compared to the commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The two enzymes were not identical with commercial T7 DNA polymerase being less processive at 37??C. Mass spectrometry of the two enzymes identified a mutation of Phe102 to Ser in the Trx subunit (TrxS102) of commercial T7 DNA polymerase. The Ser102 mutation, was found near the carboxyl terminal helix of Trx. TrxS102 was less stable than wild type Trx. In the study of the TBD structural stability, a hybrid polymerase was constructed by inserting the TBD motif into the homologous position in the Stoffel fragment of Taq DNA polymerase. The hybrid enzyme was coexpressed with Trx from an artificial operon; however, the TBD inserted retained a mesophilic binding affinity to Trx. The chimeric polymerase required 100 molar excess of Trx for processive polymerase activity at 60??C. TBD structural deformation at elevated temperatures was hypothesized to be the cause of the change in the subunit stoichiometry. Mutagenesis of TBD would be required to increase its thermostability. An efficient, rapid high throughput mutagenesis method (SLIM) was invented and would be appropriate for further studies.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA polymerases</field><field name="subject">protein engineering</field><field name="subject">thioredoxin</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23077</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representing the human body ??? science as social meaning</field><field name="creator">Daly, Tricia, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">Representing the human body ??? science as social meaning adopts and develops systemic functional social semiotics to analyse the popular science texts, The Human Body, Superhuman, Human Instinct, Brain Story, The Secret Life of Twins and How to Build a Human. These are predominantly produced through the resources of the Wellcome Trust and/or the BBC/TLC (The Learning Channel), and feature celebrity doctors (Robert Winston) or scientists (Susan Greenfield) as presenters. Adopting a modified and expanded systemic functional semiotics derived from Kress and van Leeuwen (1996, 2001), it is argued that these texts share a logic that displaces social/historical time (including broader historical and social struggles) by constructing the apparent timelessness of middle-class families, by metaphor and abstraction. Central to the temporalities of these programmes is the notion of ???going back??? to the familial in which conscious (patriarchal) time is seen as ???male??? and the unconscious timeless is seen as ???female???. Second, the penetrative digital modes of the programmes imagine different, if conventional, genders, emphasising the interior and inertial female. The popular medical science discourses highlighted in the analysis constitute an unconscious set of taken-for-granted socio-political contexts in which medical and bioscientific knowledge is paraded and celebrated. Narrative resolution of the contradictions inherent in the contextual refrain of contemporary global capitalism is largely achieved through time by the semiotic realisation of ???going back??? to evolutionary, genetic, and (hence to) essential time and to abstracted spatial metaphors.

Most of the research on the outcome of these high-risk infants has concentrated on the prevalence of major disability. The majority of high-risk children at school age have normal intelligence and no sensorineural disability. Despite this, these ???apparently normal??? high-risk children have a higher incidence of minor morbidities. Motor coordination problems are frequently reported, yet further investigation into the emergence of minor motor dysfunction, or its impact on academic achievement and everyday activities is seldom explored. The aim of this thesis was to provide a comprehensive investigation into motor dysfunction, which is commonly found in ???apparently normal??? high-risk children. This was addressed in a series of five studies that intended to provide insight into the emergence, prevalence, nature, and prediction of motor dysfunction in otherwise ???normal??? high-risk children. Study 1 examined the development of gross and fine motor skills from infancy to school age using a longitudinal cohort study design. ???Apparently normal??? high-risk children (n=58) were assessed with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales at 18 months corrected age, 3 and 5 years. A significant proportion continued to have fine motor deficits to school age (64%), reflecting a persistent problem with fine motor skills throughout this period. The proportion of infants with gross motor deficits significantly increased from 18 months to 5 years (81.1%), particularly for the ???micropreemies???. Whilst there was no gender difference found, the development of gross and fine motor skills appeared to be influenced differently by the home environment.  Study 2 examined the impact of motor dysfunction on performance at school age. The prevalence of Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) in ???apparently normal??? high-risk children was determined using a controlled cohort study design. In addition, the nature of DCD in this population was explored by testing sensorimotor abilities that possibly underlie the motor dysfunction. Fifty (50) high-risk children with IQ&amp;lt85 and no identified sensorineural disability were assessed at 8 years of age along with a matched control from their respective class at school. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children and a battery of sensorimotor tests were administered. Results indicated a significantly higher prevalence of DCD (42%) in the high-risk group in comparison to the control group (8%). In relation to sensorimotor abilities that may influence motor performance, the high-risk group scored significantly lower on most of tests, however it was neurological ???soft signs???, postural praxis, and sequencing praxis that contributed to DCD in the high-risk group. Study 3 was designed to investigate the impact of motor dysfunction on a motor-based task performed within the school setting. Specifically, this study described handwriting skills in ???apparently normal??? high-risk children, determined the prevalence of handwriting dysfunction, and investigated sensorimotor abilities that may be associated with problematic handwriting. The high-risk cohort and matched controls described in study 2 were also administered a number of handwriting tests. High-risk children were found to have poorer handwriting legibility and speed in comparison to their classmates. The prevalence of handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk group was 46%, significantly higher than controls (18%). Hand preference, pencil grasp used, and pain whilst writing were comparable to the control group. The contribution of underlying sensorimotor abilities to handwriting dysfunction in the high-risk population however was not evident. By using the same subjects in studies 2 and 3, the co-morbidity of handwriting dysfunction with DCD could be determined. Of those high-risk children identified with DCD, 43% had co-morbid handwriting dysfunction.  Study 4 explored the relationship between perinatal and environmental variables to Developmental Coordination Disorder and handwriting dysfunction in high-risk children. Perinatal and environmental variables of the 50 ???apparently normal??? high-risk children that participated in the previous study were analysed. Results indicated prolonged rupture of membranes (PROM) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) were significantly and independently associated with DCD, perhaps reflecting the impact of the antenatal infection process and visual development related to ROP on motor outcome in high-risk children. Perinatal variables were not associated with handwriting dysfunction, but high-risk males were more likely to have handwriting dysfunction. Maternal education and paternal occupation were associated with aspects of handwriting. Whilst handwriting is a motor-based activity, it appears to be influenced by environmental variables, similar to other academic areas for the high-risk population. Study 5 sought to determine whether a motor assessment at an earlier age could predict DCD in the ???apparently normal??? high-risk population at school age. Motor assessment at 12 months, 3 and 5 years for the high-risk subjects who participated in study 2 were analysed using Receiver Operator Curves (ROC curves). The 3 year assessment with the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales was the best predictor of DCD at 8 years, with the Griffiths Locomotor Scale at 3 years yielding a similar result. Findings suggest that high-risk children who scored below the specified cut-off points on 3 year motor assessments and who had a history of PROM or ROP were at greater risk of having motor-based problems that had the potential to interfere with functioning at school.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">infants (premature)</field><field name="subject">motor ability in children</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23296</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A competency based theory of business partnering : an empirical study of Australian business-to-business partnerships</field><field name="creator">Gray, David Michael, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This research, conceptualizes, operationalises and empirically tests a competency-based theory of business-partnering performance within an Australian business-partnering context. Drawing on theory from social psychology and marketing, the research integrates a number of theoretical approaches including resource-based theory, competency based theory, relational factors view, relational interaction theory, and competitive advantage theory to explain why some business partnerships are more successful than others are. The results use a ???process model of business-partnering??? performance to explain the interaction process through which business partners exploit the available partnering related ???operant resources??? and how these resources influence the performance of business partnerships and their ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Specifically, this research investigates a number of important internal resources, which facilitate the building, and maintaining of external businesspartner relations including ???joint alliance competence???, ???joint alliance structure???, ???interpersonal relational competence??? and ???market orientation???. This research shows that an adequate understanding of how these ???operant resources??? are deployed/accessed and co-created by the business partners to achieve a competitive advantage requires integration of ???relational interaction theory??? into ???resource-based theory??? and ???competency-based theory???. The results of this research show that those firms that pursue business partnerships as a competitive strategy can improve performance by engaging in a range of activities, which facilitate the building of ???relational capital??? of the partnership. The results provide support for conclusion that ???communication behaviour??? is a central and important mediating variable in the performance of business partnerships. Overall, the findings are consistent with the literature in finding support for the notion that ???joint alliance competence??? is a direct antecedent of businesspartnering performance. There is support for the notion that the partnership???s ability to govern and manage itself is an important determinant of ???communication behaviour??? and ???co-ordination behaviour???. The results identified ???market orientation???, ???co-ordination behaviour??? and ???relational capital??? as all having a direct influence on business-partnership profitability. Finally, given the relatively high failure rates of business partnerships this research provides greater opportunity for a discussion of the kinds of intervention strategies that could be used to minimise the risk of failure and/or to improve partnership performance.

It addresses a number of research questions, namely: In what ways do forms of intersubjectivity created in classroom talk shape the learning for children in two socioeconomically disadvantaged classrooms? How do teachers??? variant readings of official curriculum documents impact on classroom practices? How might the role of the teacher in such classrooms be usefully understood and articulated? The research described in the thesis draws on socio-cultural approaches to language, learning and pedagogy. Systemic functional linguistics, which models cognition as meaning, provides the major theoretical position together with tools for close linguistic analysis (Halliday 1994, 1999). Vygotsky???s complementary view of learning as the consequence of joint activity in semioticised environments highlights the role of the mediating agent (1978). Bernstein???s theory of pedagogic relations provides a useful framework for understanding the circulation of cultural dynamics through locally situated pedagogic settings (1990, 1996, 2000). The research adopts a case study approach; data comprises talk produced during a complete curriculum cycle in each primary classroom as well as interviews, written texts and official curriculum documents. The analysis proceeds through phases; that is, it initially describes the curriculum macrogenres (Christie 2002) then moves to more detailed linguistic analyses of prototypical texts from each setting. Mood, speech function and appraisal (Eggins &amp; Slade 1997, Martin &amp; Rose 2003) are systems recognised in the SFL model as those which enact intersubjective relations. Close attention to their deployment in classroom interactions reveals much about how broad social roles are enacted, how the moral regulation of the learners is accomplished and how subtle differences in learning take place. The analysis reveals considerable difference in the educational knowledge under negotiation. In one classroom, learners are stranded in localised, everyday discourses; while in the other, learners are given access to more highly valued curriculum discourses. It is argued that the interactive practices which produce such difference result from teachers??? readings of the official curriculum; readings which are shaped by particular philosophical orientations to curriculum, together with features of the local settings and their relations to the official pedagogic field.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">intersubjectivity</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">discussion</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23306</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Influence of operating conditions on lifetime performance of membrane systems in whey processing</field><field name="creator">D???Souza, Nisha Maria, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">Statistically designed experiments were conducted on a bench-scale ultrafiltration (UF) system using 10 kDa and 100 kDa polyethersulphone membranes to study the effect of operating conditions on membrane performance during whey processing. Experiments have underlined the importance of and provided a deeper understanding of factors influencing rejection. During filtration, a dynamic layer controlled protein fouling, reducing the effective molecular weight cut-off of the 100 kDa membrane and resulting in partial rejection. As pressure increases, the cake becomes denser allowing fewer and smaller passages for permeation, thereby increasing rejection of smaller solutes. Whey should be processed at high UF cross-flow velocities, relatively low transmembrane pressures, low feed concentrations and low temperatures. Low pressures help improve fractionation efficiency; high cross-flow velocities limit cake build-up and control cake thickness, thereby reducing specific cake resistance. Temperatures less than 10??C and pH values away from the protein iso-electric point inhibit bacterial growth and are compatible with protein, mineral and membrane stability. An existing model of dairy UF plants enabled determination of factors that affect membrane age and operational measures that minimise the effect of ageing. No significant effect of ageing was observed on performance at different volume concentration ratios (VCR). Operation at VCR 37 and 38 was capable of producing 80% whey protein concentrate (WPC). The effect of diafiltration water is improved when introduced over two loops with reallocation. Prevention of reallocation will dilute the total solids concentration in the retentate producing product that is out of specification. High protein rejections, lactose and ash rejection values between 5-15%, and non-protein nitrogen rejections below 50% are essential for producing 80% WPC. Fat rejection did not influence product quality although experimental studies show that fat concentration in liquid whey affects performance. Flux was the most influential measure of membrane life. Membrane elements in loops 11-12 did not require as frequent replacement compared to elements in loops 5-7 which are most susceptible to ageing. Emphasis should be placed on these elements for cleaning routines and operating conditions that minimise the effects of fouling in order to produce 80% WPC.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">whey</field><field name="subject">ultrafiltration</field><field name="subject">membrances (technology)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23309</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Women and modernity in interior design: a legacy of design in Sydney, Australia from the 1920s to the 1960s</field><field name="creator">Morrow, Carol A., Built Environment, Faculty of Built Environment, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that women were seminal to the development of interior design as a discipline and profession in Sydney, Australia. Covering the period from the 1920s to the 1960s, this study identifies Thea Proctor, Nora McDougall, Margaret Lord, Phyllis Shillito and Mary White as foundational leaders who progressively advanced interior design in Sydney through individual and collective understandings of design. Focussing on their contributions to this development, this study explains complex interrelationships between women and modernity in interior design. This emergence of the discipline and profession in Sydney situates the initiatives of these five women at a transitional phase of the field???s global development when ???interior decoration??? is challenged by modern attitudes and artistic theories of ???design???. Working as individuals, Proctor and her successors advance the profession???previously characterised as a ???natural??? pursuit for women of ???taste??? and ???style??????by their artistic, rational and practical approaches to interior design. At a time when no distinct discipline exists in Sydney, the women offer instruction and forge new directions by reformulating previous overseas traditions: incorporating a wide-range of aesthetic and theoretical conceptions of design, demonstrating common and different approaches to practice, and integrating changes in requisite knowledge and skills in response to their times. The women???s programs are conventional and progressive, common and diverse, universal and particular in content and meaning. Working within a variety of settings, the women importantly establish professional jurisdiction situating interior design in a modernist context. Significantly, their contributions challenge past readings that have diminished the early women of interior design, and at the same time, embody all the conflicts, ruptures, paradoxes and contradictions that are cental to modernity. This research redresses the lack of institutional history of interior design in Sydney and links theories of modernism and modernity to issues of gender and profession to explain the women???s significant contributions to interior design at a critical juncture of the field???s development. As such, their stories and legacy of design in Sydney contribute to a wider picture of women and modernity in interior design.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">interior decoration</field><field name="subject">women interior decorators</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23312</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Leadership behaviours of heads of schools and departments in Australian and Pakistani universities</field><field name="creator">Zaidi, Atiya H., Education, Faculty of Arts &amp; Social Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study examines transformational and transactional leadership behaviours of heads of schools/departments, and the individual level cultural dimensions idiocentrism-allocentrism, as perceived by academic staff in Australian and Pakistani universities. The principal research aim was to investigate the relationships between academics??? attributions concerning leadership behaviours of heads of schools/departments and cultural norms in a collectivistic and an individualistic culture. Samples of academic staff were randomly selected from Australian and Pakistani universities. The Australian sample consisted of 117 academics, and the Pakistani sample comprised 120 academics. Analysis was carried out using exploratory factor analysis, multiple regression analysis, and discriminant analysis. Within the context of the research, the results suggested that Australian and Pakistani university academics had similar attribution patterns for entities related to transformational, transactional, and passive leadership behaviours, and the cultural dimension allocentrism. The results also suggested that the academics of both samples did not differentiate between various transformational leadership behaviours, and perceived the transactional leadership behaviour contingent reward as part of the transformational leadership behaviour proactive leadership. Further, the academics of both samples perceived the transactional leadership behaviour passive management-by-exception and laissez-faire leadership as a single dimension, passive leadership. Analyses identified some critical relationships between perceived leadership behaviours of heads of schools/departments and idiocentrism-allocentrism variables for the two samples. The transformational leadership behaviour participative leadership was positively related to allocentrism and self-reliance for the Australian sample. The transactional leadership behaviour active management-by-exception was positively related to positive-competitiveness and negatively related to negative-competitiveness for the Pakistani sample. Passive leadership was negatively related to leadership outcomes for the Pakistani sample. Moreover, active management-by-exception and positive-competitiveness discriminated between the two samples.

Rh(1wt%) doped Fe2O3/Cr2O3, exhibits the highest activity for WGS over a wide temperature range. 5wt%CuO/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/Fe2O3-Cr2O3, 1wt%Pt/U3O8, 1wt%Pt/10%U3O8-Al2O3 and 1wt%Pt/5%V2O5-TiO2 fall into the second most active catalysts group, with an improved activity compared to commercial Fe2O3-Cr2O3 catalyst. It is clear that both the support/catalyst and the promoter can affect the efficiency of the WGS, leading to the obvious inference that the reaction rate is controlled at the promoter ??? support interface. Further kinetic studies and characterisation (TPR, TPD, pulse-adsorption (reaction)) on Rh/Fe3O4/Cr2O3 have been conducted. The study, conducted under conditions without inhibition from products of both forward and backward reactions, shows that the overall reaction rate expression is described as: 2 22 ??? =0.0041exp(???4042.6 ) 0.64 0.5 ???0.024 exp(???6022.9 ) 0.46 0.73 CO CO H O CO H r PP P P T T . Kinetics studies carried out under fuel reforming gas compositions shows that reaction rate expression changed when the temperature of reaction varied. The reaction rate equations at temperatures of 573K, 623K and 673K are derived as: 573K: 2 2 2 - 2.84 10-6 0.6 0.12 - 9.08 10-7 0.09 0.52 rCO = ?? PCO PH O ??

TPR, TPD, TPO characterisation studies and reoxidation of catalysts by CO2 or H2O show that the active site for high temperature WGS reaction on Rh/Fe2O3/Cr2O3 is reduced magnetite Fe3O4 which dissociatively breaks down the H2O to form H* and OH* and adsorbs CO2. The deposited metal, Rh, acts as a promoter by facilitating the uptake of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO), desorption of H2 (at high temperature) and CO2.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hydrogen</field><field name="subject">iron oxides</field><field name="subject">chromium</field><field name="subject">catalysts</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23321</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-?? in vascular smooth muscle cells</field><field name="creator">Bonello, Michelle Rita, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular occlusive disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis, in part due to its regulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotype. The molecular mechanisms regulating the expression of PDGF-receptor-?? (PDGF-R-??), which binds all known dimeric forms of PDGF except PDGF-DD, are poorly understood. Here it is demonstrated that PDGF-R-?? protein and transcriptional regulation in SMCs is under the positive regulatory influence of the zinc finger nuclear protein, Sp1. An atypical G-rich Sp1-binding element from -61 to -52 bp (-61G10 - 52) upstream of the transcriptional start site, was identified in the PDGF-R-?? promoter via electrophoretic mobility shift, competition and supershift analysis. Mutation of this sequence ablated endogenous Sp1 binding and activation of the PDGF-R-?? promoter. In addition to Sp1 regulation of PDGF-R-??, it was shown that fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) represses PDGF-R-?? transcription, mRNA and protein expression in SMCs. The FGF-2-induced inhibition of PDGF-R-?? was rescued by block of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. Interestingly, mutation of the aforementioned novel Sp1-response-element blocked FGF-2-induced repression of PDGF-R-?? transcription. FGF-2 was also shown to stimulate Sp1 phosphorylation in an ERK1/2-dependent manner, enhancing its interaction with the PDGF-R-?? promoter. Further analysis revealed that mutations of residues Thr453 and Thr739 in Sp1 resulted in loss of FGF-2-mediated repression of PDGF-R-?? transcription. These findings demonstrate that FGF-2 stimulates ERK1/2- dependent Sp1 phosphorylation, thereby repressing PDGF-R-?? transcription via Sp1 binding the -61/-52 element in the PDGF-R-?? promoter. Thus, phosphorylation triggered by FGF-2, switches Sp1 from an activator to a repressor of PDGF-R-?? transcription, a finding previously unreported in any Sp1-dependent gene. It is also shown in this thesis that the proto-oncogene Ets-1 controls PDGF-R-?? transcription and mRNA expression in SMCs. Mutational, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed the existence of a reverse Ets binding motif (-45TTCC-42) in the proximal region of the PDGFR- ?? promoter which bound both recombinant and endogenous Ets-1. Ets-1- inducible PDGF-R-?? expression was dependent upon the integrity of both the - 45TTCC-42 motif and the previously identified -61G10 -52 element, which resides upstream of -45TTCC-42 and mediates Sp1 induction. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at nanomolar concentrations, stimulated levels of Ets-1 and increased PDGF-R- ?? transcription and mRNA expression without affecting Sp1 expression. Disruption of the -45TTCC-42 motif or -61G10 -52 element blocked H2O2 activation of the PDGF-R-?? promoter. These studies identify a functional Ets motif in the PDGF-R-?? promoter which plays a pivotal role in agonist-inducible PDGF-R-?? transcription. The interplay between transcription factors such as Sp1 and Ets- 1 in the promoter of genes can exert profound influences on gene regulation. Modulating gene expression affects biological processes such as SMC proliferation and phenotype changes, which contributes to changes in vessel integrity, a hallmark of atherosclerosis. This study provides a greater insight in the functional consequences of Sp1 and Ets-1 interplay in PDGF-R-?? gene regulation and in general, provides a greater understanding of the functional regulation of cooperating transcription factors.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An empirical investigation of maintainer behaviour occurring during software maintenance</field><field name="creator">Parkin, Peter, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">In recent years many tools and techniques have been proposed and even implemented which support maintenance programmers to gain an understanding of existing source code. However, studies have found that some tools are of marginal benefit and not appropriate for all maintenance tasks. This may be due to tools having been designed with little regard to the common behavioural practices that occur during software maintenance tasks because the current state of knowledge of such practices is quite limited. The aim of this study is to alleviate the above situation by performing a detailed behavioural analysis of software maintenance tasks undertaken under laboratory experiment conditions. To support this aim an experiment was conducted in which twenty-nine student subjects experienced in C programming independently undertook one of two maintenance tasks on the same C program in a university environment. The data produced from the experiment included subjects??? interactions with documents and code and their responses to program comprehension questions at the end of the task. The results indicate that maintenance task success is associated with a heightened concentration on high-level procedures that control the execution of lower level procedures. Among subjects, IT industry experience was linked to efficient comprehension of program and task documentation and the performance of more code searches. In general, code searches mainly involved searches for procedure name references. Compared to subjects undertaking the enhancement task, subjects performing the complex corrective task utilised program documentation more but also obtained a greater understanding of the elementary operations and control-flow of the program. In addition, this study illustrates a method to identify common information usage strategies from the recorded maintenance behaviour of subjects. Largely unsuccessful attempts were also made to sequentially analyse maintenance behaviour. This lack of success is possibly attributable to the as-needed comprehension approach adopted by subjects. The results of this research suggest that cost-effective maintenance of software is best supported using tools implementing facilities for feature location and visualisation of the control-flow of a program. The former facility would be most helpful to maintainers undertaking corrections, whereas the latter would particularly assist maintainers undertaking enhancements.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software maintenance</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23336</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The origins of the banlieue rouge: politics, local government and communal identity in Arcueil and Cachan, 1919-1958.</field><field name="creator">Burgess, Jasen Lewis, School of History, UNSW</field><field name="description">By elucidating the origins of the banlieue rouge, a belt of communist-dominated suburbs surrounding Paris that arose during the interwar years and reached its apogee under the Fourth Republic, this thesis addresses the problem of why twentieth-century France was home to a pro-Soviet communist party with mass support. Specifically, a local study of the PCF in Arcueil and Cachan, two neighbouring communes south of Paris with divergent political evolutions since World War I, is used to discern how and why the Parti communiste fran??ais (PCF) came to exert hegemony in the working-class suburbs of Paris. After surveying the historiography of communism in France and beyond, this thesis concludes that the communist banlieue rouge was born of working-class alienation from bourgeois society that was nourished by a communist counter-society that was contingent upon the PCF???s capacity to adapt and respond to local circumstances. Using archival sources and statistical analysis, it demonstrates that in Arcueil and Cachan rapid suburbanisation and an attendant proletarianisation created the pre-conditions for the rise of the PCF. This study finds that during the interwar period the PCF rapidly emerged as an electoral force in both suburbs as it set about laying the foundations of a communist counter-society, especially in Arcueil where it won control of local government in 1935. In Arcueil, the PCF spearheaded the local Resistance movement during World War II and then under the Fourth Republic went on to consolidate a nascent communist communal identity, while in Cachan its influence fell victim to Cold War politics. The pre-conditions for the rise of communism were apparent earlier and to a greater degree in Arcueil, an industrialised, working-class suburb with long-standing radical traditions, than in the traditionally conservative Cachan. In Arcueil, the PCF was more successful than its counterpart in Cachan at exploiting an alienation that was not only part of the deep-seated historical traditions of the French working class but was also part of everyday life f or workers forced to live in miserable conditions. In suburbs such as Arcueil, suburban working-class pride at being a social outcast was conflated with communism to create a durable communist communal identity.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effects of polyethylene wear debris and oestrogen deficiency on fracture healing in a rodent model</field><field name="creator">Rajaratnam, Rema Antonette, Prince of Wales Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Patients who suffer from severe joint destruction caused by arthritis often undergo total joint arthroplasty (TJA). A major limitation of this treatment and common long-term complication is the development of aseptic loosening of the prosthesis in as many as 20% of patients. The current paradigm to explain aseptic loosening proposes that wear debris generated from the prosthesis initiates a macrophage-mediated inflammatory response by resident macrophages, leading to osteoclast activation and bone resorption at the implant interface. This can then lead to the development of a peri-prosthetic fracture. The principal aim of fracture healing is to restore the bone to its original form and strength. However, this ultimate goal can be altered if the healing is impaired. This impairment may be due to bone disease (osteoporosis) or even the introduction of a foreign material such as PE wear debris that could have migrated from the articulating surface to the fracture site. A standard closed unilateral fracture of the right femur was performed in both normal and oestrogen deficient rats following fixation with a k-wire. Ceridust (PE wear debris) was combined with hyaluronic acid and saline and injected directly into the fracture site. Femurs were assessed using radiographs, histology and immunohistochemistry. Histological analysis revealed that complete remodelling was achieved in all control groups by 6 weeks post-fracture with mechanical strength returning to normal values. The mechanical properties of the fractures were not influenced by the presence of PE wear debris in the dose and timing examined. Histology and immunohistochemistry however, did reveal a local effect of the presence of PE wear debris. The histology adjacent to the PE particles was inferior to the controls but did not manifest itself in a reduction in the mechanical properties except in the oestrogen deficient bone at 6 weeks post-fracture. The levels of MMP-1 and TNF-?? correlated to the presence of PE particles. In this thesis, I have shown the mechanism by which bone remodelling in fracture healing could be retarded due to the presence of PE wear debris, by increased matrix degradation in both normal and oestrogen deficient animals.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">estrogen</field><field name="subject">wound healing</field><field name="subject">biomedical materials</field><field name="subject">artificial implants</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23351</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Hope and abundance: the counter globalisation movement as multitude ??? breaking the logic of pathological modernity</field><field name="creator">Arvanitakis, James, History of Philosophy &amp; Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Using the theoretical work of Hardt and Negri???s Empire and Beck???s Risk Society, I define current experiences of modernity as ???pathological???. The term ???pathological modernity??? is used because it portrays a modernity dominated by ???spirals of crisis??? that are aggravated by the solutions proposed to solve them. Like the ???war on terror??? and environmental degradation, I argue that many crises facing the world today reflect the characteristics of capital as they globalised, branded, hybridised, boundless and endless.  ???Pathological modernity??? has various dimensions including a Cartesian logic underscored by an ???eternal truth???, free-market fundamentalism, certainty in decision making, and a scientism which believes all  challenges can be overcome. Additional dimensions include an operational form of biopower, pathological reflexivity, and a frontier disposition that continually encloses non-commodified spaces (or commons) creating a crisis of scarcity.  Despite its dominance, pathological modernity is being challenged on many fronts. Amongst these is the ???counter-globalisation??? movement (CGM). A heterogenous movement, it represents a qualitatively different form of globalisation and logic that brings it into conflict with pathological modernity.  Using participatory research I investigate this movement grounding it within Hardt and Negri???s (2004) ???multitude???. Extending Hardt and Negri???s descriptions, I propose that the multitude ???works in common??? to establish new commons in both the physical and cultural spheres. Concentrating on the ???cultural commons??? I argue that these represent a new form of biopolitics and promote abundance where scarcity once existed. The four cultural commons identified are hope, trust, safety and intellect. Based on the work of Marcel Mauss, I argue that the reciprocal, free and open exchange and sharing of these cultural commons creates ???authentic??? communities based on openness, alterity and abundance. While the CGM works to establish new commons, pathological modernity encloses and commodifies them, turning hope into material aspirations; trust into anxiety; safety into security; and intellect into intellectual property.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">globalisation</field><field name="subject">Empire</field><field name="subject">commons</field><field name="subject">multitude</field><field name="subject">hope</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23357</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transcriptional regulation of the human cytochrome P450 2J2 gene by activator protein-1</field><field name="creator">Marden, Nicole Yvonne, Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes catalyses the oxidative metabolism of lipophilic xenobiotics such as drugs and environmental chemicals, and also plays an essential role in the biosynthesis and metabolism of endogenous compounds such as cholesterol and bile acids, vitamins, steroids, arachidonic acid and eicosanoids. Cytochrome P450 2J2 (CYP2J2) is a recently identified member of the human CYP protein family that is highly expressed in the heart, vasculature, liver and other tissues. CYP2J2 metabolises arachidonic acid (AA) into epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which have a number of potent biological activities including cytoprotective, vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory effects. Given its widespread tissue distribution and the biological actions of EETs, CYP2J2 is likely to play an important role in cellular physiology, and altered expression of CYP2J2 may have pathophysiological consequences. Indeed, recent literature studies have indicated that CYP2J2 protein levels are decreased in vascular endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia and reoxygenation, and that maintenance of CYP2J2 expression enhances cell survival. Thus, CYP2J2 expression may be impaired in diseases or conditions associated with decreased oxygen availability, such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke and atherosclerosis, and this may contribute to their pathogenic consequences. Despite its likely importance in human physiology and pathophysiology, very little is known about the regulation of CYP2J2 gene expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms that control expression of the CYP2J2 gene. In particular, this study was designed to identify factors that regulate the expression of the CYP2J2 gene in the liver-derived HepG2 cell line during normoxia and hypoxia. A 2.4 kb fragment of the 5???-flanking region of the CYP2J2 gene (corresponding to nucleotides -2341 to +98, relative to the translation start site) was isolated from a human genomic library. Automated searching of the upstream regulatory region of CYP2J2 identified several putative binding sites for the transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1). Because AP-1 activity is altered in hypoxia, the possibility that AP-1 may participate in the regulation of CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia was explored. Cell culture studies examined the relationship between the expression of CYP2J2, and the  AP-1 genes c-fos and c-jun, in HepG2 cells cultured in normoxia and hypoxia. Down-regulation of CYP2J2 mRNA and protein in hypoxic HepG2 cells was associated with the pronounced up-regulation of c-Fos protein from an undetectable level in normoxic cells; c-Jun protein levels were readily detectable in normoxia, and were also increased in hypoxia. Transient transfection studies revealed distinct effects of Fos and Jun proteins on CYP2J2 promoter activity. While the CYP2J2 promoter was strongly activated by c-Jun, c-Fos was inactive, and also abolished gene transactivation elicited by c-Jun. These results suggest that the constitutively expressed c-Jun is important in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia stimulates the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which do not support CYP2J2 transcription, leading to gene down-regulation. Experiments with CYP2J2 promoter deletion constructs revealed that the region between -152 to -50 bp relative to the translation start site was crucial for activation of CYP2J2 by c-Jun. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and transfection studies identified two distinct elements within this region that were involved in c-Jun-dependent transactivation: an AP-1-like element at -56 to -63 bp, and an atypical AP-1 element at -105 to -95 bp. c-Jun homodimers interacted specifically with both elements. Separate mutagenesis of either element significantly impaired c-Jun-dependent transactivation of CYP2J2, while mutagenesis of both elements eliminated c-Jun-responsiveness. EMSAs established that c-Jun, but not c-Fos, interacted with both elements in normoxic HepG2 cells. Furthermore, mutagenesis of either c-Jun-response element significantly decreased the basal transcriptional activity of the CYP2J2 promoter in HepG2 cells, while mutagenesis of both elements almost completely suppressed basal promoter activity. These findings indicate a pivotal role for c-Jun in the maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. Transfection studies indicated that c-Fos suppresses c-Jun-dependent activation of CYP2J2 at both the -56/-63 bp and -105/-95 bp c-Jun-response elements. However, c-Fos-dependent inhibition appears to be mediated by distinct mechanisms at these two regulatory elements. While both elements interacted with c-Jun homodimers, only the -105/-95 bp element was able to interact with c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers. Thus, the up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia, and the shift from c-Jun homodimers to c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, directly decreased c-Jun binding and transactivation at the -56/-63 bp element. In contrast, up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia altered the composition of proteins bound at the -105/-95 bp element from c-Jun to c-Fos/c-Jun. Inhibition of promoter activity occurs because c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers can occupy, but not transactivate, the CYP2J2 promoter via the -105/-95 bp element.  In summary, this thesis provides novel information on the molecular mechanisms that control the differential expression of the human CYP2J2 gene in normoxia and hypoxia. In particular, this study has established that the AP-1 proteins c-Jun and c-Fos play a crucial role in modulating the transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter in response to cellular stress. Binding of c-Jun to two distinct c-Jun-response elements within the CYP2J2 proximal promoter induces transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 gene and is essential for maintenance of CYP2J2 expression in normoxic cells. The up-regulation of c-Fos in hypoxia promotes the formation of c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimers, which inhibit transcriptional activation of the CYP2J2 promoter by c-Jun, thus contributing to decreased CYP2J2 expression in hypoxia. Impaired expression of CYP2J2 may contribute to cellular injury in diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms responsible for mediating altered CYP2J2 expression may eventually lead to therapeutic strategies that manipulate the expression of this important human gene.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">protein</field><field name="subject">cytochrome P-450</field><field name="subject">genetic transcription</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23360</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The nature of error, error detection and automaticity in skilled behaviour</field><field name="creator">Baker, Troy Andrew, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This series of research attempted to clarify a number of issues relating to highly skilled performance including the frequency and nature of errors, the error detection capabilities and the purported role of automaticity in the production of skilled behaviour. The first study applied Rasmussen???s (1980) skill-, rule- and knowledge-based behaviour taxonomy to examine the frequency and nature of errors in skilled and highly skilled behaviour. Results provided an estimate of the frequency of skill-based errors, which has been unavailable in previous diary studies. A significantly lower proportion of skill-based errors were reported by elite compared with recreational golfers, suggesting that a characteristic of highly skilled behaviour is a reduction in the tendency toward minimal levels of cognitive control exhibited in everyday tasks and by those of lesser skill. In order to establish the level of insight skilled performers have into their actions, the second study manipulated visual feedback to examine the detection of error in elite and recreational golfers. Results indicated that an increase in skill was associated with an increase in the ability to detect error, however the error detection capability of elite players was far from perfect with fewer than 60% of marginal errors detected. Visual confirmation of the outcome is apparently necessary for precise error detection even in highly skilled golfers. In addition, both elite and recreational golfers attributed errors to poor concentration, yet this result appeared to be dependent upon observation of the error. Elite and recreational golfers reported attending to cues relating to the target, rhythm and technique during execution of the golf swing. The final series of experiments examined the effect of a sudden irrelevant sound on the performance of elite and recreational golfers. The first phase of this series of experiments demonstrated that an irrelevant sound occurring during the golf swing could disrupt the performance of elite and recreational players. The second experiment suggested that, in elite golfers, the disruption of performance was most likely an orienting response to the sudden noise. The results of these studies suggest that although attentional resources become available with the progression to skilled behaviour, even a highly proceduralised movement sequence, such as the golf swing, never becomes completely resource free. The final experiment suggested that increasing the attentional engagement of elite golfers could attenuate the negative impact of a sudden irrelevant sound on performance. Whilst there is no question of a tendency towards automaticity with extended practice, overall the research questions the proposition that highly skilled behaviour is characterised by a literal interpretation of automaticity, either in the planning or execution of movement, or in relation to error detection.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">errors</field><field name="subject">golf</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23363</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Can government influence the effective development and implementation of hospital admission policy?</field><field name="creator">Wolk, Jael, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">It has consistently been documented in many countries and sectors that there are difficulties in implementing public policy effectively. A priori, the Australian health care system is no exception to this general proposition. While governments issue directives with particular goals in mind these goals are not always met, because of the modifications, interpretations or lack of uptake by targeted populations. However it is not clear the extent to which these difficulties occur in the public hospital sector, and we lack clear empirical data on this phenomenon. This thesis investigates the effects of a state government directive on the development and implementation of elective admission policies in New South Wales public hospitals. It did this by three separate but related studies that examined the impact of the directive at the hospitals??? management and staff levels. The first two studies were quantitative and qualitative surveys of hospital managers and admission staff. The management survey aimed to ascertain the extent to which managers responded to the directive in terms of developing and implementing hospital policies. The staff survey sought to investigate staff awareness and knowledge of the developed policies. The third study was a qualitative analysis of the policy contents to determine the extent to which they reflected the aims and objectives of the government directive guidelines. All three studies found a general lack of relevance and applicability of the government directive and its guidelines to individual hospital organisations. The manager survey showed a disconnection between the central government office responsible for implementing the directive and hospital managers??? perspectives. This was apparent by the lack of response to the directive by many hospitals and the fact that managers often passed on the task of implementing the  directive and its guidelines to other hospital staff. The findings of the qualitative analysis of policies showed evidence of hospital strategies to manage pressures created by the directive. These difficulties were corroborated by the surveyed staff that reported difficulties in translating the directive???s requirements (as reflected by the hospital policy), into the reality of their daily work; a lack of organisational commitment to policy enforcement; and a suspicion regarding the directive???s political motives. The findings of this thesis show that, as with other public service sectors effective policy implementation in the public hospital arena is problematic, with government agendas frequently not aligned with the requirements of stakeholders, and inadequate understanding of implementation barriers. Recommendations are made regarding methods to improve the synchronicity of political directives with organisational realties in the public hospital sector.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">hospitals</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">admission and discharge</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23398</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Time, quasi-temporal change and imaginary numbers</field><field name="creator">Wiszniewski, Witold Roman, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The thesis is mainly concerned with the argument for dynamic time. Accepting McTaggart???s proof of the unreality of time, it is argued however, that any description of dynamic time involving static concepts must lead to a contradiction. It is shown that the contradiction arising from this proof is equivalent to the contradiction posed by Aristotle???s definition of change: change is the possession of incompatible properties. A special case of such a change is quasi-temporal change, defined as the possession of incomparable properties at the same time. Furthermore it is claimed that change is a primitive entity. The Block Universe view that three-dimensional dynamic and four-dimensional static representations of the world are equivalent to each other is rejected because of the unknown nature of imaginary numbers describing the time-like dimension of spacetime. It is proposed that the imaginary number i is an mathematical embodiment of change, expressed in the form of quasi-temporal variable: i = [1,-1]. As such i is a scalar variable with two numbers, 1 and ???1, assigned to it. To develop further this idea the Special Theory of Relativity and Hamilton???s theory of the complex numbers are used. It is claimed that the natures of imaginary numbers the time-like dimension are the same. It is shown that this dimension can be given by two opposite displacements of light occurring at the same time. To use Hamilton???s theory a pair of two times is proposed: normal time and dimensional time. The moments of these times are identified with the Hamilton???s primary and secondary moments of time respectively. It is shown that Hamilton???s theory is invariant upon such identification. This allows the extension of the argument forming the theory of the complex numbers. The second theme of the thesis is an argument for multiplicity of times. It is proposed that every being of a natural kind exists in its own time. Individual time is taken as a composition of topologically open time and topologically closed time. Such a composition allows an explanation of the convolution of change and permanence and also formulation of a new interpretation of Quantum Mechanics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">time.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23401</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Trust and power-distance: cross-cultural issues in juvenile justice conferencing</field><field name="creator">Sivasubramaniam, Diane, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Conferencing is a Restorative Justice practice operating in juvenile justice systems in Australia. Some conferences are convened by police, despite research demonstrating that ethnic minority youth often view police as biased or untrustworthy. Justice research in evaluative legal procedures indicates that perceived third party bias and outcomes delivered by a third party affect fairness judgments. Many disputants regard conferences as more fair than court. However, psychological mechanisms underlying fairness judgments in conferences, where offenders participate in outcome decisions, have not been directly investigated. This research program examined the effects of outcome and perceived convenor bias on procedural and distributive justice ratings in conferencing. Past research indicates that people high and low on Hofstede??s power-distance dimension differ in their emphases on outcome and third party bias when forming fairness judgments. This thesis investigated whether power-distance moderated the interactive effect of trust and outcome on fairness judgments in conferences. Study 1 established power-distance variation in a university sample, and similarity with a community sample on perceived police bias. Study 2 confirmed that high power-distance people who consider police biased against them may nonetheless choose to participate in police-convened conferences. Studies 3 and 4 extended previous research examining interactive effects of trust and outcome on justice judgments in evaluative procedures, investigating whether power-distance moderated this effect. No significant effects of power-distance and trust emerged, but the findings demonstrated the importance of outcome fairness (correspondence between outcomes and beliefs) in determining procedural justice. Studies 5, 6 and 7 extended this investigation to conferencing procedures. Studies 6 and 7 employed a computer-simulation, allowing participants to interact with a conference transcript and select outcomes, thereby investigating the effects of trust and power-distance on outcome choice, as well as the effects of trust, power-distance, and outcome on justice evaluations. Studies 5 and 6 were unsuccessful in manipulating bias by varying convenor identity (police versus civilian). Study 7 successfully manipulated bias according to convenor behaviour and revealed that third party bias in conferencing affected outcome choices but not fairness judgments. Results are discussed in terms of implications for culturally-relevant police practices, procedural justice theory and conferencing policy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Juvenile justice</field><field name="subject">administration</field><field name="subject">trust</field><field name="subject">restorative justice</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23404</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Facilitation of action learning groups: an action research investigation</field><field name="creator">Ball, Dianne Lesley, School of Industrial Relations &amp; Organisational Behaviour, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis is to better understand the role of the facilitator in action learning groups. In particular, it focuses on groups established within an organisation, in which the facilitator is a member of the organisation. The two central research questions are: (1) How did the facilitator influence problem solving and group interactions, and how did this vary over time and between each group, and (2) How did the facilitator's role in the organisation impact on the action learning groups? The methodology of action research and a number of principles of grounded theory are employed. The investigation was conducted within a large public teaching hospital over a two year period. Four groups volunteered to participate in the project. Two of these groups were already established and two were newly created for the purpose of the research project. The groups came from different departments and members represented a range of professional backgrounds. The size of the groups ranged from 5 to 12 participants. Each group identified a real and significant project to work through using an action learning approach. The researcher negotiated with each group what it wanted from a facilitator role, and then facilitated each meeting. All group meetings and individual interviews were audiotaped and the facilitator kept journal notes after each meeting or interview. Two potential methodological issues arose. The first related to the application of some of the principles of grounded theory to the action research investigation. The second was that the study was conducted in the researcher???s own organisation while the researcher was employed full-time, and this posed particular issues. Literature related to action learning, process consultation and small group facilitation was explored in the literature review. The purpose of this review was to critically evaluate different perspectives and approaches by frequently cited authors in these subjects, and to understand the uses and limitations of existing models. This gave the researcher an understanding of gaps in the literature related to (1) the role of the facilitator of action learning groups, and (2) conducting research in one???s organisation.  Data were analysed for each group separately and then compared and contrasted in the final chapter. The objectives of the analysis were to (1) examine how the findings for each individual group address the research questions, (2) explore how the findings in each group change over time, and (2) examine how and why the findings in the groups were similar and different to each other. The findings across each of the groups have similarities and differences. There were seven interventions used by the facilitator that were common across the groups. The interventions changed over the duration of the project. Process skills were required to different degrees and at different times. Nine hypotheses were developed as the theory. Some key findings are as follows. First, it was found that groups that have not had prior experience in action learning do not understand the concept and process of facilitation and are unable to articulate in advance what they want from the facilitator. Second, the role of the facilitator cannot be separated from the skills, values and understandings of the individual facilitator. Third, a major role of the facilitator in this investigation was sharing knowledge of the organisation, the broader health care sector, and general management. In each group the facilitator performed both process and content roles, and a further role that can be called ????????????contextualising???. The findings show there is a distinction between the theoretical role and the role of an individual facilitator in practice. Further research opportunities are identified. These include (1) understanding how participants who have been involved in a facilitated action learning group may be able to apply their experience in a non-facilitated action learning group; (2) comparing the needs and expectations of participants in a facilitated action learning group within an organisation with action learning participants who are not part of an organisation; (3) understanding how facilitation of an action learning group within an organisation may change if the facilitator is in a management role, or in a peer position with participants.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">group facilitation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23407</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept</field><field name="creator">Dickman, Nancy Margaret, School of Health &amp; Sports Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigated the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on self-concept in the context of older women. Very little research in this area has focused on older women. At the same time it attempted to identify possible mechanisms underpinning exercise-induced change in self-concept, including the effect of the group and change in real and perceived body condition and real and perceived fitness. Adherence issues and the hierarchical structure of self-concept were examined in an exploratory manner. An extensive literature review was undertaken. It concluded with a preliminary exercise-self-concept model which would be used to explain and evaluate the thesis??? hypotheses. Two studies were undertaken. Study 1 validated the English version of the Self-perception in Exercise Questionnaire (SPEQ) (Sorensen, 1999) and examined relationships between exercise status, age, body size, and physical self-perceptions in a sample of older Australian women. The SPEQ was found to be a valid and reliable instrument to be used in Study 2 to measure self-perceptions relevant to exercise in older Australian women. Study 2, a randomised controlled trial, examined the effect of exercise and the exercise setting on older women???s self-concept. It comprises the main body of work for this thesis. It compared a group of older women exercising together in a group to a similar group of women who performed exactly the same exercise alone. Then both groups were compared to a similarly motivated group of women who did not exercise, but were waiting to start an exercise program. Using a pre-posttest design it measured exercise-induced change in self-concept, selfperceptions, satisfaction, and 13 physiological measures. Following a 12-week exercise treatment, the older women who walked regularly either alone or in a group thrice weekly experienced significantly improved total, physical, and social self-concept, more positive perceptions of their body and fitness, increased satisfaction with self and with life in general, and improved aerobic fitness compared to controls. When the three experimental conditions were compared, however, these outcomes were significant only for group exercise compared to controls; not for alone exercise compared to controls. Of greater importance, when the two exercise settings, walk alone and walk in a group, were compared, the women who walked in a group experienced significantly improved physical self-concept, satisfaction with life, and more positive perceptions of their body and fitness compared to the women who walked alone. Unexpectedly, aerobic fitness also increased significantly for the women who walked in a group relative to controls, but not for the alone walk condition. Taken together these findings suggest group exercise offers considerable psychological and aerobic fitness benefits to older women. These are valuable and unique findings. They are reinforced by the high adherence (91%) and participation rates (95%) achieved in the walk trial. Partial support was found for the proposed exercise-self-concept model and the hierarchical structure of self-concept was demonstrated. Perceived change accounted for more of the variance in self-concept than real body and fitness change. Effect sizes were larger for certain physical self-perceptions than for global self-concept. In conclusion, this thesis has extended current knowledge of exercise effects on selfconcept to older women, added a systematic exercise-self-concept review, added a useful instrument for measuring older women???s self-perceptions in exercise in future studies, and added to current knowledge of mechanisms underpinning improved self-concept following exercise. Exercise, moderate-intensity walking, was found to positively and significantly affect older women???s self-concept. The exercise setting differentially affected older women???s selfconcept; effects were significantly greater when the exercise was performed in a group with similar others. The group exercise setting and its effect on self-perceptions is suggested as a possible mechanism underpinning the positive exercise-self-concept association.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">older women</field><field name="subject">exercise.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23413</field></doc><doc><field name="title">International finance: issues related to law and financial development</field><field name="creator">Wu, Qiongbing, The school of banking &amp; finance, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation examines three distinctive issues that concern the regulators and policy makers in the development of financial markets. It contains three stand-alone research projects within the context of law, finance and economic growth. Chapter 2 examines the dynamic relationship between banks and economic growth from the points of view of market efficiency and asset pricing theory. Publicly traded banks are broadly representative of a country???s banking sector, so that banking industry stock prices will broadly reflect the performance of a country???s banking sector. Because previous research has established that the institutional framework, as well as the aggregate size, of the banking sector can significantly affect economic growth, this chapter investigates whether the stock returns on a country???s banking sector contain information about future economic growth, and whether the specific country and institutional characteristics that affect the functioning of the banking system and market efficiency also influence this relationship. Using the data from 18 developed and 18 emerging markets, the chapter finds a significant and positive relationship between bank excess return and future economic growth in both the time-series and panel analyses. The chapter also finds that this positive relationship is significantly strengthened by the enforcement of insider trading law, by banking crises, by bank disclosure regulations and financial development, but is weakened by government ownership of banks. Chapter 3 investigates the role of bank idiosyncratic volatility in economic growth and systemic banking crises. Using the same dataset from Chapter 2, this chapter finds an ambiguous relationship between bank volatility and economic growth in the time-series studies, which suggests that the effect of bank volatility on economic growth is more country-specific. In the panel analyses, the chapter finds a negative but very weak relationship between bank volatility and future economic growth. This negative relationship is magnified by banking crises and bank disclosure standards, but is alleviated by the government ownership of banks, the enforcement of insider trading law and financial development. The chapter goes further to examine whether bank volatility leads to the occurrence of systemic banking crises, and finds that the marginal effect of bank volatility on the probability of banking crises is very weak for the sample of all markets, and this result is mainly driven by the data from the emerging markets. However, bank volatility is a significant predictor of banking crises even after being controlled for macroeconomic indicators, which implies that market forces are more powerful in promoting the soundness of the banking system in developed markets. We also find that those macroeconomic and banking risk management indicators have different impacts on the probability of banking crises for the emerging and developed markets. Therefore, caution needs to be taken in interpreting the cross-country results of the studies on banking crises. Chapter 4 studies the corporate governance issues in China, a significant developing country that has been neglected by the current law and finance literature. Incorporated with the legal environment and ownership structure of China???s listed companies, the chapter develops a simple game model to study a neglected aspect of current corporate governance literature: the expropriation arising from the mixture of weak investor protection, ownership concentration coexisting with ownership dispersion, and the absence of a controlling shareholder. The last two chapters find that government ownership undermines the positive link between bank excess return and economic growth, but alleviates the negative impact of bank volatility on growth as well. This chapter shows that government ownership is also a two-edged sword in corporate governance in China: it leads to a double-agency problem; however, the strong legal protection of State assets also increases the cost of expropriation. Using the data from 1996 to 2003, the chapter finds the empirical evidence consistent with the model. By analysing the puzzles in China???s stock market, the chapter suggests that improving the legal protection of investors is the key issue in the future development of the financial market.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">banks and banking</field><field name="subject">financial development</field><field name="subject">economic growth</field><field name="subject">market efficiency</field><field name="subject">law and finance</field><field name="subject">corporate governance</field><field name="subject">investor proctection</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">international finance.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23416</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A quality-driven decision-support framework for architecting e-business applications</field><field name="creator">Al-Naeem, Tariq Abdullah, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Architecting e-business applications is a complex design activity. This is mainly due to the numerous architectural decisions to be made, including the selection of alternative technologies, software components, design strategies, patterns, standards, protocols, platforms, etc. Further complexities arise due to the fact that these alternatives often vary considerably in their support for different quality attributes. Moreover, there are often different groups of stakeholders involved, with each having their own quality goals and criteria. Furthermore, different architectural decisions often include interdependent alternatives, where the selection of one alternative for one particular decision impacts the selections to be made for alternatives from other different decisions. There have been several research efforts aiming at providing sufficient mechanisms and tools for facilitating the architectural evaluation and design process. These approaches, however, address architectural decisions in isolation, where they focus on evaluating a limited set of alternatives belonging to one architectural decision. This has been the primary motivation behind the development of the Architectural DEcision-Making Support (ADEMS) framework, which basically aims at supporting stakeholders and architects during the architectural decision-making process by helping them determining a suitable combination of architectural alternatives. ADEMS framework is an iterative process that leverages rigorous quantitative decision-making techniques available in the literature of Management Science, particularly Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods and Integer Programming (IP). Furthermore, due to the number of architectural decisions involved as well as the variety of available alternatives, the architecture design space is expected to be huge. For this purpose, a query language has been developed, known as the Architecture Query Language (AQL), to aid architects in exploring and analyzing the design space in further depth, and also in examining different ???what-if??? architectural scenarios. In addition, in order to support leveraging ADEMS framework, a support tool has been implemented for carrying out the sophisticated set of mathematical computations and comparisons of the large number of architectural combinations, which might otherwise be hard to conduct using manual techniques. The primary contribution of the tool is in its help to identify, evaluate, and rank all potential combinations of alternatives based on their satisfaction to quality preferences provided by the different stakeholders. Finally, to assess the feasibility of ADEMS, three different case studies have been conducted relating to the architectural evaluation of different e-business and enterprise applications. Results obtained for the three case studies were quite positive as they showed an acceptable accuracy level for the decisions recommended by ADEMS, and at a reasonable time and effort costs for the different system stakeholders.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">software architecture evaluation and design</field><field name="subject">design of e-business applications</field><field name="subject">optimization-based evaluation</field><field name="subject">quality-driven design</field><field name="subject">electronic commerce</field><field name="subject">decision support systems</field><field name="subject">computer architecture.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23419</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume: Astrolabe Park, Sydney, Australia</field><field name="creator">Jorstad, Lange B., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spatial and temporal variation in inorganic contaminant concentration and distribution in a landfill leachate plume is examined to determine the mechanisms responsible for the observed variation, and to provide an assessment of the implications of this variation with respect to the interpretation of monitoring data, specifically with regards to its application to geochemical modelling. An integrated approach to field investigation was utilised in this study, including sample collection from a network of standard and bundled piezometers, surface and borehole geophysical investigation techniques, and a manometer board for the measurement of hydraulic head in bundled piezometers. Nine groundwater sampling events were conducted over a 12 month period, with sample analyses comprising field measurement of water quality parameters and redox sensitive elements, and laboratory analysis for major and trace elements and stable isotopes (??18O, ??2H, ??13C-DIC, ??15N). The vertical position of the centre of mass of the leachate plume was observed to vary up to 2 metres between monitoring events, and concentrations of key indicator parameters were observed to fluctuate by as much as 160%. The electrical images created by surface resistivity transects along a groundwater flow path between the landfill and a groundwater-fed pond a short distance downgradient suggest a plume configuration characterised by discrete pulses of concentrated leachate migrating in a conservative manner between the landfill and the pond. It is hypothesized that these leachate slugs are flushed into the aquifer during sustained periods of rainfall, presumed to be a significant driver of leachate mobilisation into the underlying aquifer. The most significant hydrogeochemical processes affecting contaminant mobilisation, transport and attenuation in the leachate-impacted shallow aquifer included microbial degradation of organic waste, dissolution of inorganic waste, ion exchange, precipitation of sulfide and carbonate minerals, mixing with rainfall recharge along flow path, and redox transformations along the plume fringe. These processes are supported by hydrogeochemical data analysis, and generally agree with the results of inverse geochemical modelling. While analysis of detailed groundwater monitoring appears to provide a plausible description of the plume dynamics, the results of the electrical resistivity transects indicates a more varied and complex plume configuration than is suggested by the borehole data alone. This integration of investigation techniques underscores the inherent inadequacy of even a high-resolution monitoring well network to accurately describe the full extent of variation in time and space within a contaminant plume, even in a relatively simple aquifer environment, and accentuates the potentially significant limitations of site-scale hydrogeochemical interpretation based solely on borehole monitoring data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sanitary landfills</field><field name="subject">leachate</field><field name="subject">plumes (Fluid dynamics).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23427</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Integrating subsurface ocean temperatures in the statistical prediction of ENSO and Australian rainfall &amp; streamflow</field><field name="creator">Ruiz, Jose Eric, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As a global climate phenomenon, the El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) involves the coupling of the ocean and the atmosphere. Most climate prediction studies have, by far, only investigated the teleconnections between global climatic anomalies and the ???surface??? predictors of ENSO. The prediction models resulting from these studies have generally suffered from inadequate, if not the lack of, skill across the so-called boreal ???spring barrier???. This is illustrated in the first part of this thesis where the applicability of the SOI phase for long-lead rainfall projections in Australia is discussed. With the increasing availability of subsurface ocean temperature data, the characteristics of the Pacific Ocean???s heat content and its role in ENSO are now better understood. The second part of this thesis investigated the predictability of ENSO using the thermocline as a predictor. While the persistence and SST-based ENSO hindcasts dropped in skill across the spring barrier, the thermocline-based hindcasts remained skillful even up to a lag of eighteen months. Continuing on the favorable results of ENSO prediction, the third part of this thesis extended the use of the thermocline in the prediction of Australia???s rainfall and streamflow. When compared to models that use ???surface??? predictors, the model that incorporated thermocline information resulted in more skillful projections of rainfall and streamflow especially at long lead-times. More importantly, significant increases in skill of autumn and winter projections demonstrate the ability of the subsurface ocean to retain some climatic memory across the predictability barrier. This resilience can be attributed to the high persistence of the ocean heat content during the first half of the year. Based on weighting, the model averaging exercise also affirmed the superiority of the ???subsurface??? model over the ???surface??? models in terms of streamflow projections. The encouraging findings of this study could have far-reaching implications not only to the science of ENSO prediction but also to the more pragmatic realm of hydrologic forecasting. What this study has demonstrated is an alternative predictor that is suitable for the long range forecasting of ENSO, rainfall and streamflow. With better hydrologic forecasting comes significant improvement in the management of reservoirs which eventually leads to an increase in the reliability and sufficiency of water supply provision.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">ocean temperature</field><field name="subject">rain and rainfall</field><field name="subject">streamflow</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">El Ni??o current</field><field name="subject">southern oscillation</field><field name="subject">thermoclines (oceanography).</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23433</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Brain reserve: a three year longitudinal neuropsychological and brain imaging examination of the ???use it or lose it??? principle</field><field name="creator">Valenzuela, Michael J., Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">The overall objective of this dissertation was to increase scientific understanding of brain reserve. Chapter 1 describes how brain reserve has come to be viewed in two distinct ways: differential expression of brain injury on the basis of individual differences in gross brain properties (neurological), or on the basis of lifespan patterns of complex mental activity (behavioural). Evidence in the Alzheimer???s disease and ageing literature has been extensive, yet with conflicting reports. In order to better evaluate this evidence, a systematic review of cohort studies is the focus of Chapter 2. Complex mental activity was found to be associated with reduced incidence of dementia and slowed rate of cognitive decline. Neurological brain reserve evidence was limited. A major task of this dissertation was to develop a more standard and complete behavioural brain reserve instrument. Chapter 3 relates the development of the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire (LEQ) in a group of 86 healthy elderly. The LEQ had adequate levels of internal consistency and reliability. In a validation test, higher LEQ scores were also found to predict attenuated cognitive decline over 18 months independent of covariates including premorbid IQ. Chapter 4 describes how both LEQ (as a measure of behavioural brain reserve) and intracranial volume (as a measure of neurological brain reserve) significantly predicted cognitive decline over three years in a sample of 70 aged subjects. Total LEQ was furthermore significantly correlated with hippocampal volume independent of intracranial volume, and this association mediated the relationship with cognitive decline. Behavioural brain reserve may therefore work by protecting individuals from hippocampal atrophy. The fifth chapter explores therapeutic and neurobiological aspects of behavioural brain reserve in a preliminary fashion. A randomized-control mental activity trial was run with 20 healthy elderly who received repeat magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Mental activity subjects were found to have selective and sustained upregulation of phosphocreatine metabolism in the hippocampal region, a finding of potential neuroprotective significance. Experience-dependent neuroplasticity is proposed as a unifying framework in the final chapter, allowing synthesis of the present findings and reconciliation of the neurological and behavioural approaches to brain reserve.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">brain</field><field name="subject">cognition</field><field name="subject">neuropsychology</field><field name="subject">brain imaging.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23436</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gene studies in epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="creator">Kemp, Matthew W, St. George Clinical School, UNSW</field><field name="description">Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited blistering diseases that share the common feature of blister formation subsequent to normal mechanical insult of the epidermis. Despite two decades of investigation at both epidemiological and genetic levels, there remains much yet to be uncovered about the pathophysiology of this disease. This research had dual aims. Firstly, by enrolling patients in Australia and New Zealand with the simplex type of EB (EBS) in a screening programme in conjunction with a highly detailed review of the EB and intermediate filament literatures, we hoped to gain a better understanding of the correlation between genotype and phenotype in EBS. Secondly, we attempted to evaluate the use of baculoviral vectors as a means of introducing the type VII collagen cDNA into human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Among the EBS patients screened we identified a novel multi residue deletion in keratin 5 which led to a surprisingly mild form of epidermolysis bullosa Dowling ??? Meara. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of epidermal tissue from the affected individual showed that the mutant transcript was present at levels 2.7 fold higher than the wild type transcript. We demonstrated a family in which the presence of a previously reported keratin 14 mutation A413T appeared to induce disease expression in only one of the three individuals found to carry the mutations. We also identified two EBS families with no mutations in either keratin 5 or keratin 14. This is the first study to analyse EB patients from New Zealand and the first to report the presence of a deletion mutation in the 2B domain of keratin 5. The results of our type VII collagen transfer work showed that baculoviruses can be engineered to contain insert sequences in excess of 10kb and are able to gain entry to both human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes. Electron microscopy and analyses of the baculoviral vectors showed that the lack of protein expression subsequent to infection of human dermal fibroblasts and primary human epidermal keratinocytes is likely due to the inability of the vector to escape cytoplasmic endosomes.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">epidermolysis bullosa</field><field name="subject">genetics.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23439</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Deterrence, punishment severity and drink-driving</field><field name="creator">Briscoe, Suzanne Marie, Social Science &amp; Policy, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis tests one of the major propositions of deterrence theory: that increases in the severity of punishment can reduce the likelihood of offending. To this end, a case study in which the statutory penalties were doubled for almost all drink-driving offences in New South Wales, Australia, is examined. Two quasi-experimental studies were undertaken to assess the impact of these legislative changes: an interrupted time-series analysis of road crash rates (Study 1) and an analysis of drink-driving reoffending rates before and after the penalty changes were implemented (Study 2). Study 1 showed a significant increase in a surrogate measure of alcohol-related road crashes after the tougher drink-driving penalties were introduced. Further analyses suggested that this increase was driven primarily by a secular rise in non alcohol-related crashes that coincided with the policy???s implementation. Two possible conclusions about the deterrent effect of the policy are drawn from these findings: (1) that there was a reduction in alcohol-related road crashes which was overwhelmed by the rise in non alcohol-related crashes occurring around the same time or (2) that there was no change in crash rates. Study 2 found that drink-drivers who were convicted under the new penalty regime were less likely, and took longer, to reoffend than drink-drivers convicted before the introduction of the new penalties. This reduction in reoffending was only apparent for drink-drivers residing in country and regional areas and was small in magnitude.These latter findings are consistent with the possibility that the penalty changes coincided with a reduction in alcohol-related crashes but suggest that any decrease is likely to have been relatively small. A third study using a scenario-based survey methodology was also undertaken to examine the relationship between legal sanctions and willingness to drink-drive, controlling for other factors. The results of this study showed that participants who were more knowledgeable about drink-driving penalties were less likely to state that they would offend in the drink-driving scenario than participants who were less knowledgeable about the law. The implications of these findings for deterrence theory and criminal justice policy are discussed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">drinking and traffic accidents</field><field name="subject">drink driving</field><field name="subject">deterrence</field><field name="subject">sentencing</field><field name="subject">criminal justice interventions</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23442</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isolation and characterisation of intact RBL-2H3 mast cell granules ~ phosphorylation events during secretion</field><field name="creator">Kranenburg, Tanya Ann, School of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Mediators released from the granules of antigen-activated mast cells contribute to allergies, inflammation and diseases such as asthma. One of the major models used to study mucosal mast cells is the RBL-2H3 mast cell line. While there has been considerable research on the initial signalling events following IgE receptor (Fc??RI) cross-linking, the movement of granules to sites of exocytosis is poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms that control granule movement to and fusion with the plasma membrane could provide novel targets for improved asthma and allergy therapeutics. To this end, an isolated intact population of granules from the RBL-2H3 mast cell provides a powerful research tool and as such the primary aim of this work was to isolate intact granules from the RBL-2H3 mast cell. Using iso-osmotic Percoll gradients we have isolated an intact granule population from RBL-2H3 mast cells. This granule population contained three granule markers: ??- hexosaminidase, serotonin and chymase. Triton X-100 pre-lysis resulted in loss of granule markers from this main peak, indicating that the isolated granules are in fact intact. Further analysis of the granule population showed that it is free from bulk contamination with other organelles and plasma membrane. The granules were estimated to have a density of 1.055 ??? 1.092g/mL, significantly less dense than that of rat peritoneal mast cell granules (1.2g/mL; [1]). Using an intact versus lysed approach, granule-associated proteins and phosphoproteins, from unactivated RBL-2H3 cells, were determined. Nine unknown granule-associated proteins were found using silver staining of gradient fractions separated on a SDSPAGE gel. In addition, four unknown serine or threonine granule-associated phosphoproteins were found. Molecular weight comparison suggested overlap in some of the unknown proteins and phosphoproteins. Probing for protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms confirmed previous results suggesting that a small population of PKC?? localised to the granules [2], and extended these results to include a population of PKC??I. The serine/threonine phosphatase PP1 does not appear to be granule associated. However, there was a small loss of PP2A from the granules (upon lysis), suggesting that perhaps a subpopulation of PP2A is granule-associated. The main granule peak represents a secretion competent population as Fc??RI-mediated activation of the cells resulted in a significant loss of granule markers from this peak. At the peak rate of antigen-induced secretion a number of changes occur in the phosphorylation of granule-associated phosphoproteins. In addition to an increase in the phosphorylation of three of the phosphoproteins seen in resting mast cell granules, eight new proteins were seen. Whether these proteins are granule-associated is currently unknown. PKC?? was found to translocate away from the granules at the peak rate of secretion, perhaps representing an important control mechanism in granule exocytosis. None of the tested PKC isoforms were found to translocate to the granules, providing little clue as to the identity of the kinase that may be involved in these phosphorylation events. However, as PKC??I is granule-associated and does not translocate off the granules, it would suggest that this kinase might be important for some of the observed phosphorylations. Overall the studies in this thesis show for the first time a rapid gradient-based method for the isolation of intact granules from unactivated and activated RBL-2H3 mast cells. These granules were used to determine granule-associated proteins and phosphoproteins, as well as to investigate changes that occur during the secretory process. In addition, the results show that a number of proteins have increased serine/threonine phosphorylation at the peak rate of antigen-stimulated secretion. This implies that phosphorylation is likely to play a role in the control of granule exocytosis. The identity of these proteins deserves further investigation. Thus, isolated intact RBL- 2H3 mast cell granules provide a powerful research tool to further investigate the mechanism and control of granule exocytosis.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">mast cells</field><field name="subject">phosphorylation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23445</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Infant feeding practice and adherence to Ugandan infant feeding guidelines among HIV positive and HIV negative mothers</field><field name="creator">Babirye, Juliet Ndimwibo, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Introduction: In previous decades, the basis of child health and survival strategy in the developing countries has been the promotion of breastfeeding. However, transmission of HIV through breast milk to infants in the postnatal period has caused uncertainty over the best feeding technique. Previous policies in Uganda promoted breastfeeding even among HIV positive mothers without offering an informed choice of feeding mode. Consequently, the Ugandan Ministry of Health developed and adopted policy guidelines on feeding of infants and young children in the context of HIV/AIDS in 2001. However, little is known about their impact on infant feeding behaviour in Bushenyi district. Methods: This cross-sectional study conducted in Bushenyi district, Uganda, compared 94 HIV positive and 100 HIV negative mothers with infants aged less than 12 months on infant feeding practice, on the predictors of the different modes of infant feeding practice, and adherence to Ugandan infant feeding guidelines. Results: All HIV negative and 55% of HIV positive mothers were breastfeeding their infants aged less than 12 months. Among breastfeeding mothers, 85% of the HIV negative were breastfeeding non-exclusively. Of concern to the possibility of HIV transmission, 61% of the HIV positive mothers who were breastfeeding were doing so non-exclusively. Adherence to Ugandan infant feeding guidelines was higher in HIV positive mothers (67%) than in HIV negative mothers (41%).  HIV negative mothers were more likely to be adherent if the mothers??? youngest infant was not a first-born (OR= 0.30, 95% CI = 0.10 ??? 0.88) and if they were aware of HIV transmission during pregnancy (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.02 ??? 6.66). The single most predictive factor of adherence among HIV positive mothers was attendance at an infant feeding counselling session (OR= 5.63, 95% CI = 2.15???14.73). Conclusions: Counselling support is necessary for mothers to make infant feeding choices that are viable and sustainable. The self-reported method of assessing adherence in our study could have been sub-optimal and may therefore overestimate the adherent proportions reported here. Addressing development of better assessment methods and methods for improving adherence to guidelines is crucial for preventive strategies. Recommendations: Increase coverage of infant feeding counselling by introducing peer counsellors in the community.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23448</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Feeling the future: the role of current emotions in affective forecasting</field><field name="creator">Laham, Simon M., Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The aim of this thesis was to examine the effects of people???s current moods and emotions on affective forecasting. The primary hypothesis was mood congruence: people currently feeling happy were expected to generate relatively positive affective forecasts and people currently feeling sad were expected to generate relatively negative forecasts compared to people currently in a neutral state. In addition, a moderated mood congruence hypothesis, predicted by the Affect Infusion Model (AIM, Forgas, 1995), stating that mood congruence effects are more pronounced under conditions of constructive processing, was tested. Two secondary hypotheses concerning the processing and motivational consequences of transient moods were also examined in each of the studies in this thesis. Studies 1 to 3 examined these hypotheses using a variety of manipulations of constructive processing. In Study 1, happy, neutral and sad participants made affective forecasts about a variety of everyday events, under overt instructions to process constructively or not. In Study 2, the ambiguity of the forecast was the manipulation of constructive processing. In Study 3, Need for Cognition, was used as a measure of constructive processing. Results of Studies 1-3, however, did not support either the mood congruence or the moderated mood congruence hypotheses. Further, neither of the secondary hypotheses was supported. Studies 4 and 5 examined the influence of transient high arousal emotions on affective forecasts. In Study 4, anxious or neutral people forecasted their feelings about an upcoming public speaking engagement and also rated their willingness to give a public speech. Study 5 replicated and extended Study 4 by examining how happy, sad and angry  participants made those same predictions. In both Study 4 and 5, anxious people made more pessimistic forecasts and were less likely to engage in a public speech than were neutrals. This effect did not generalize to anger. Results suggest that while anxiety does have implications for affective forecasting and decision making, lower intensity moods and anger do not. Implications of these results are discussed with a focus on the benefits of an emotion-specific approach to the study of affect and affective forecasting.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">emotions</field><field name="subject">forecasting</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23369</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Multiple-response sequences in adult Korean TESOL classrooms</field><field name="creator">Ko, Sungbae, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">In this thesis, multiple-response sequences (MRSs) are examined. These are a language classroom practice in which two or more students respond to a teacher???s question or other elicitation. The study uses tools of Conversation Analysis to investigate over 38 hours of classroom talk- in-interaction in TESOL classes comprising monolingual adult Korean learners. Classes were recorded on audio and video in Seoul, South Korea and Sydney, Australia. About 1050 cases of MRSs were found and analysed. In the study, four distinct major types of multiple responses (MRs) are identified. These are: the identical MR, in which two or more students provide the same response; the complementary MR, in which two or more students??? responses provide essent ially the same meaning, but in different forms; the collaborative MR, in which two or more students collectively provide various parts of the response in the construction of a single response; and the competitive MR, in which two or more students provide responses that diverge from one another. The study also examines complex MRs, which are combinations of the basic four types, and expanded sequences, in which MRs occur in preparatory stage or post-expansion sequences. It was found that the teacher and students can produce highly complex, co-ordinated and orderly talk in the course of MRSs. The study also considers MRSs as a potential locus for second language learning. The relevance of this study to some major theories of second language acquisition is discussed, in particular in relation to social interaction in the classroom.Finally, some suggestions for future research in the area are presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23375</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical modelling of ferromagnetic embolisation hyperthermia in the treatment of liver cancer</field><field name="creator">Tsafnat, Naomi, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Both primary and secondary liver cancers are common and the majority of patients are not eligible for surgical resection or a liver transplant, which are considered the only hope of cure. Mortality rates are high and there is a need for alternative treatment options. New forms of local treatment work best on small tumours; large ones, however, remain difficult to treat. Hyperthermia involves heating tumours to 40??-44?? C. The aim is to heat the entire tumour without damaging the surrounding normal tissue. Treating deep seated tumours is technically challenging. Ferromagnetic embolisation hyperthermia (FEH) is a novel method of treating liver tumours. Magnetic microspheres are infused into the hepatic artery and lodge primarily in the tumour periphery. An applied alternating-current magnetic field causes the microspheres to heat. Animal experiments have shown that this is a promising technique. There is a need for modelling of FEH prior to commencement of clinical trials. Analytical and numerical models of tumour heating during FEH treatment are presented here. The models help predict the temperature distributions that are likely to arise during treatment and give insight into the factors affecting tumour and liver heating. The models incorporate temperature-dependent thermal properties and blood perfusion rates of the tissues and a heterogeneous clustering of microspheres in the tumour periphery. Simulations show that the poorly perfused tumours heat preferentially while the liver is effectively cooled by blood flow from the portal vein. A peripheral distribution of heat sources produces a more even temperature field throughout the tumour, compared to a heat source that is centred within the tumour core. Large tumours reach higher temperatures and have higher heating rates, supporting experimental findings. Using temperature-dependent, rather than constant, values for thermal conductivities and blood perfusion rates results in higher temperatures within the tumour. The uneven clustering of microspheres in the tumour periphery leads to a more heterogeneous temperature distribution in the core, but it has less of an effect on the wellperfused liver. The results show that FEH has the potential to effectively treat liver tumours and the technique merits further investigation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">bio-heat transfer</field><field name="subject">hyperthermia</field><field name="subject">numerical modeling</field><field name="subject">liver cancer</field><field name="subject">heat</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23378</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Has resource allocation policy change improved equity? lessons from Ghana</field><field name="creator">Asante, Augustine Danso, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Equitable allocation of health care resources is crucial for promoting health equity. Since the emergence of the resource allocation working party (RAWP) formula nearly three decades ago, many countries have implemented resource allocation policy reforms aiming to improve equity. Little is known about whether, how and the extent to which, most of these policies have actually improved equity. This study examined whether, and the extent to which, decentralisation of health resource allocation decision-making in Ghana has improved equity in funding within regions and explored the factors that influenced the equitable allocation of resources for health care in Ghana. The study used a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods. Two of the ten regions in Ghana: Ashanti and Northern, covering the southern and northern sectors of the country, were purposefully selected. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to measure levels of relative deprivation of districts applied as a proxy of need. An equity-adjusted share index (EAS) was developed and used as a yardstick against which equity in funding was assessed. Factors influencing the equitable allocation of resources were explored qualitatively through open-ended interviews with policy makers and other health sector stakeholders. The study found that resource allocation in the Ashanti and Northern Regions were largely inequitable, in terms of differentially benefiting the most disadvantaged districts. The proportion of variance in the actual share of funds that could be explained by the predicted EAS was below 50% for all the years examined, except for the allocation of government funds to the Ashanti Region for 1999, where the proportion of variance was 56%. Resource allocation in the Northern Region favoured three urban districts over their rural counterparts. However, in the Ashanti Region, there was a significant shift in resources from richer to poorer districts from 2000 to 2002. The Kumasi Metro district, for example, saw its share of donor-pooled funds reduced drastically from 20% of the total budget in 2000 to 7.2% in 2001 and 5.6% in 2002. Key factors influencing resource allocation and equity included low funding of the health system, local capacity to utilise funds efficiently, manpower availability, politics, donor influence and the nature of collaboration with the local government. The study concluded that intra-regional resource allocation in Ghana???s Ashanti and Northern regions was less equitable than expected, despite efforts to redistribute funds. It recommended more effective mechanisms for promoting equity through intra-regional resource allocation in Ghana.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ghana</field><field name="subject">health</field><field name="subject">resource allocation.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23381</field></doc><doc><field name="title">I don???t mind being a diabetic but not every day!: learning to live with a chronic condition</field><field name="creator">Demirkol, Abdullah, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Chronic conditions and their management have become a major global public health problem which poses a serious challenge for both health care systems and affected individuals. Type 2 diabetes is one such condition affecting almost 200 million people around the world, a number that is expected to double by 2020. As with most chronic conditions its management requires significant and permanent changes in people???s daily life practices as well as a strict medication regimen. Recent research demonstrates that it is possible to control the complications of diabetes, and even to prevent its development in predisposed individuals by following recommended treatments. Yet studies show that only 2% of people living with diabetes heed their treating team???s advice. This signals a serious discordance between scientifically generated information and its place in the daily lives of people living with diabetes. This study sought to discover how to change the factors that prevent people with type 2 diabetes from following their recommended treatments. Firstly a participant observation process in four diabetes education centres was used to define the characteristics of the context in which people with diabetes and their treating teams interacted. This was followed by a nine-month participatory action process in two of the four centres in which participants defined the problematic areas in the management of their diabetes and devised plans to tackle these problems. They then attempted to implement these plans while exploring how and why their plans did or did not work. The findings indicate that the decision to follow recommended treatments is far from being a matter of individual choice. Rather it is heavily influenced by a complex interaction of numerous factors that people with diabetes have limited power to change. This study reveals that the management of chronic conditions such as diabetes could be enhanced where operational and practical knowledge about the condition is provided to people living with the disorder by health care providers responsive to patients??? perspectives, and where patients, providers and policy-makers recognise that health is a resource constructed in the wider social context, whose every element needs to be harnessed in encouraging people to make healthier life decisions.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">diabetes.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23384</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Adaptive protocol suite for wireless sensor and ad hoc networks</field><field name="creator">Liu, Bao Hua (Michael), Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Continuing advances in wireless communications and MEMS (Micro-Electro Mechan- ical Systems) technologies have fostered the construction of a wide variety of sensor and ad hoc networks. These networks have broad applications spanning wide ar- eas, such as environmental monitoring, infrastructure maintenance, traffic manage- ment, energy management, disaster mitigation, personal medical monitoring, smart building, as well as military and defence. While these applications require high per- formance from the network, they suffer from resource constraints (such as limited battery power, processing capability, buffer space, etc.) that do not appear in tra- ditional wired networks. The inherent infrastructure-less characteristic of the sensor and ad hoc networks creates significant challenges. This dissertation addresses these challenges with two protocol designs. The main contributions of this dissertation are the design and evaluation of CS- MAC (stands for CDMA Sensor MAC), a novel multi-channel media access control (MAC) protocol for direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) wire- less sensor networks. Our protocol design uses combination of DS-CDMA and fre- quency division to reduce the channel interference and consequently improves system capacity and network throughput. We provide theoretical characterisation of the mean multiple access interference (MAI) at a given node in relation to the number of frequency channels. We show that by using only a small number of frequency chan- nels, the mean MAI can be reduced significantly. Through discrete event simulation (using UC Berkerly NS-2 simulator), we provide comparison of our proposed system to a pure DS-CDMA system as well as a contention based system. Simulation results reveal that our proposed system can achieve significant improvement in system efi ciency (measured in packet/second/channel) of a contention based system. When the same number of packets are transmitted in the network, our system consumes much less communication energy compared to the contention based system. A distributed channel allocation protocol is also proposed for the network forma- tion phase. We prove that our algorithm converges with correct channel assignments. Simulation results reveal that a much smaller number of channels is required than theoretical value when nodes are uniformly randomly deployed. The second contribution of this dissertation involves the design and evaluation of two location-aware select optimal neighbour (SON) algorithms for CSMA/CA based MAC protocol for wireless ad hoc networks. Both algorithms concentrate on the improvement of energy eficiency of the whole network through the optimisation of the number of neighbours of each node. Our algorithms not only consider radio electronic energy consumption (e.g., coding, decoding) and radio transmission energy consumption (e.g., power amplifier), but also the electronic energy consumption at those irrelevant receivers (those who are not addressed by the transmission) that are located within the transmission range. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms can achieve signi??cant energy savings compared to the standard IEEE 802.11.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">sensor networks.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23387</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Making space to breathe : values, identity and accountability in a faith-based NGO</field><field name="creator">Kurti, Linda, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">This project examines the impact on a Christian mission organisation of the decision to accept government funding and add an explicit international development focus to its work. During the 1980s the Anglican Board of Mission (ABM), the national mission agency of the Anglican Church of Australia, entered into a contractual relationship with the Australian Government which ultimately led to accreditation as a development agency and involvement with the Australian international development sector. This process has significantly influenced ABM both structurally and philosophically, bringing a creative tension within the organisation between two related but distinct approaches to Christian witness. A cooperative inquiry method was chosen with the aim of fostering organisational learning within ABM. The researcher became a participant in a team of five which conducted three cycles of inquiry over a year. This team of staff members and the researcher explored the influence of the growing relationship with government on their faith-based NGO and its implications within the context of Christian mission. Notions of intentionality, accountability and legitimacy within the relationships with their stakeholders emerged as significant foundations for the work of the organisation. The cycles of inquiry generated a body of co-created knowledge which, it is argued, have pointed the way to managing ABM???s dual roles. Its multiple accountabilities - to government, to its Anglican constituency, and to overseas church partners - are understood as offering a framework through which it can continually assess its organisational integrity and fidelity to its value base. Articulating intentionality of purpose and a clear theological understanding of mission and development were identified as crucial if ABM is to maintain its legitimacy as derived from the mandate of the Anglican Church to undertake Christian mission and development on its behalf. ???Making space to breathe??? became a metaphor to describe the task of the organisation in creating both a reflective space which opens possibilities for transformed praxis, and a liminal space between the two Programs of the organisation in which a unifying philosophical ground can be discovered.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-governmental organizations</field><field name="subject">nonprofit organizations.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23454</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insider trading regulation ??? the impact on world equity market performance and information based trading</field><field name="creator">Grankvist, Mats, Banking &amp; Finance, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the impact of insider trading regulation and its enforcement on bid-ask spreads, information asymmetry proxies, volatility, trade frequency and trade sizes. It employs an exclusive intra-day market-microstructure data-set for 29 countries and 32 exchanges and utilizes structural simultaneous equations models with distributed geometric lags estimated with GMM, controlling for market architecture, trading demand, minimum tick size and Fama-French factors. This thesis finds that enforcement of insider trading regulation in a country, rather than the strictness of written insider trading law, reduces information asymmetry and bid-ask spreads, increases volatility, and has an overall positive impact on traded value. The positive impact is mostly concentrated in the smallest stocks in the sample. The regulation of disclosure requirements has similar, but not identical, beneficial externalities in the market. The results support the prediction by Bhattacharya and Daouk (2002) that the fall in the cost of equity that results from insider trading prosecution in a country is due to a reduction in adverse selection. This thesis also find some support of the free inside information scenario of Medrano and Vives (2004), where volatility increases when insiders are forced to disclose the inside information before legally trading on it, if insider trading is not permitted and the regulation is enforced.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23466</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Mother knows best: mothers as moral educators in the fiction of Anne Bront?? and Elizabeth Gaskell</field><field name="creator">Chan, Amiria Ai-Mee, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis concentrates on identifying and examining ambivalence and contradictions in the discourse of moral education within mid-nineteenth-century British literature. Through an analysis of contemporary women???s advice literature and the fiction of two authors I locate the discourse within the larger ideologies of femininity (which defined women as different from men based on their gender) and domesticity (which assigned women to the domestic sphere because of gender) and analyse its fundamental features. The mother was a representation of the ideal woman and thus the measure for standards of behaviour within the discourse of moral education, and, indeed, within the ideologies of femininity and domesticity for all women. I focus on the inconsistencies that the discourse of moral education attempts to mask in its representations of women. Part I (Chapters One, Two and Three) examines the social standards of behaviour for mothers established in women???s advice literature and the literature???s simultaneous resistance to these standards. Chapters Four and Five are dedicated to Anne Bront?????s two novels, Agnes Grey and The Tenant of Wildfell Hall; in particular, Chapter Five examines how Helen Huntingdon???s attempts to be the perfect moral mother are constantly open to conflicting ideological interpretation exposing ambivalence within the discourse of moral education and in the novel???s approach to the discourse. Chapters Six, Seven and Eight focus on many of Gaskell???s short stories as well as her novel Ruth. The inherent conflict within the discourse of moral education results in three separate images of motherhood for Gaskell???s fiction: traditional mothers who gain their moral influence through an association with death, the ideologically contradictory moral mother, and women who use maternal traits to live in communities of women without men. I conclude that none of the texts are categorically resistant to or complicit with the ideals within the discourse of moral education but are internally contradictory. In particular, the fiction simultaneously promotes conventional ideals of womanhood and moral mothers as self-sacrificing and nurturing and offers a vision of women either in unhappy compliance with or otherwise defying these ideals, for example, by living in unconventional relationships without men.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23469</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Responsibility and accountability in theory and practice: the truth and reconciliation commission???s investigation of human rights abuse in South Africa</field><field name="creator">Carman, Marina, School of Politics &amp; International Relations, UNSW</field><field name="description">The main aims of the investigation conducted here are to draw out important debates in theory and in the South African social context over the concepts of responsibility and accountability for human rights abuse, and to look at how these were present within, and impacted on, discussions within and around the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The TRC did not specifically discuss or define theoretical concepts of responsibility or accountability. However, I argue that it is possible to draw out some important features of its implicit approach ??? particularly in terms of its emphasis on collective responsibility and social context (in addition to individual responsibility), and its emphasis on moral arguments for individuals and collectives to accept responsibility and hold themselves accountable by contributing to future change. This ambitious and complex approach raised some important theoretical issues, which have been discussed and debated in the theoretical literature. These include: the relationship between individual responsibility, collective responsibility and the influence of ???the system???; the nature of collective responsibility; the nature of morality; the distinction between moral and political responsibility; and how individuals and collectives can or should be held accountable. In South Africa, these theoretical debates inter-mingled with a range of other factors, including individual and collective interests, motives and political perspectives. From an analysis of the existing literature on the TRC and original interviews conducted with key informants, I draw out three main opposing views which I argue arose in the South African social context about responsibility and accountability, and what the TRC could and should have done to address these. In a detailed analysis of the TRC???s hearings and Final Report, I draw out how theoretical debates, and these three opposing views, were present within and impacted on the TRC???s work. I argue that it was impossible for the TRC to satisfy everyone and resolve these debates, and that its approach led to unrealistic expectations of its work and its role more generally. This has impacted negatively on how the TRC was and is perceived.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23475</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate disclosure by listed companies in the People???s Republic of China and Australia: seeking an appropriate pathway for the regulation of the Chinese securities market</field><field name="creator">Fu, Jian, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">With the rapid growth in the development of economic reform in the People???s Republic of China since the late 1970s, China???s legal system has also been undergoing major reform and development. This has seen the emergence of a major effort to draw upon the law reform experiences of other countries, especially in the area of economic law reform. As the securities industry is a key component of an increasingly corporatised market economy, it has been necessary to adopt an effective body of securities laws. Disclosure is the fundamental issue of securities laws as it exists in market transactions and the conduct of market participants. As such, the development of an appropriate body of disclosure law and practice is vital to the integrity of securities law and ultimately to the market economy. It is for this reason that this dissertation looks at the development of China???s securities market and corporate disclosure laws, and identifies the forces that have led to its current form and content. This dissertation argues that China???s legal system must be seen as a product of China???s distinctive history and local circumstances. It analyses the current nature of China???s corporate disclosure laws and notes that China???s law reformers have relied heavily upon the US model which may not necessarily suit China. Based upon a number of theoretical understandings of the transplantation and development of law, this dissertation argues that China???s approach to law reform in this area has not always produced a body of law that is appropriate to China???s particular circumstances. It suggests that valuable insights can be gained from a comparison of the methods of corporate disclosure law reform that were followed in Australia. The Australian experience is relevant to China as Australian lawyers and regulators have played an important role in fashioning securities regulation in Hong Kong and as Hong Kong has sometimes been seen as providing useful models for China itself.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23478</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Institutionalisation of integrated urban stormwater management: multiple-case analysis of local management reform across metropolitan Sydney</field><field name="creator">Brown, Rebekah Ruth, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This dissertation contributes to advancing the institutionalisation of integrated urban stormwater management in pursuit of sustainable urban water environments. It is now accepted that traditional approaches to managing urban stormwater environments are unsustainable and that integrated approaches reflecting an ecosystem-based approach need to be mobilised. However, the implementation of this approach in practice remains consistently problematic. Impediments are hypothesised to be related to the administrative inertia of local management practices. This hypothesis is investigated through a multiple-case study of eight local government organisations in Metropolitan Sydney by applying the following research question ??? what factors generate institutional capacity in local government for facilitating integrated urban stormwater management?  Between mid-1999 and mid-2001 a state government program designed to reform local urban stormwater management practice chiefly through the collaborative preparation of integrated catchment management plans, provided an opportunity to collect empirical data on the capacities needed for facilitating an integrated management approach. Analysis of the program implementation revealed that this capacity could be measured in terms of a local management dynamic involving three mutually interdependent spheres of activity including the role of the stormwater officer, the intra-organisational context and the inter-organisational context.  The capacities important for facilitating a successful integrated urban stormwater management practice were found to relate to the capacity for organisational and cross-sectoral interaction as opposed to being mobilised by a top-down regulatory intervention. For this local organisational interaction the particular capacities of the local stormwater officer that were demonstrated to be important included the ability to facilitate an action-learning environment, relationship building and negotiation between players across the catchment. For the intra-organisational context it was essential that the organisation had political commitment to the management of the urban water environment as expressed through departmental management systems, a dedicated interdepartmental policy committee and dedicated organisational resources. For the inter-organisational context it was clearly demonstrated that the successful cases prioritised building and maintaining active relationships between organisations around environmental management. Based on these results a formative framework for the development of future local management capacity building methodologies concludes the dissertation.</field><field name="date">2003</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23886</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of the mother-figure in the novels of Katharine Susannah Prichard and Eleanor Dark</field><field name="creator">Noble, Jenny Austin, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that through bringing together two branches of inquiry???the literary work of Katharine Susannah Prichard and Eleanor Dark and socio-feminist theory on health, contagion and the female body???the discursive body of the mother-figure in their novels serves as a trope through which otherwise unspoken tensions???between the personal and the political, between family and nation and between identity and race in Australian cultural formation???are explored. The methodology I use is to analyse the literary mother-figure through a ???discourse on health??? from a soma-political, socio-cultural and historical perspective which sought to categorise, regulate and discipline women???s lives to ensure that white women conformed to their designated roles as mothers and that they did so within the confines of marriage. The literary mother-figure, as represented in Prichard???s and Dark???s novels, is frequently at odds with the culturally constructed mother-figure as represented in political and religious discourses, and in popular forms of culture such as advertising, film and women???s magazines. This culturally constructed ???ideal??? mother-figure is intimately linked to nationalist discourses of racial hygiene, of Christian morality, and of civic and social order controlled by such patriarchal institutions as the state, the church, the law and the medical professions during the period under review. This is reflected in Prichard???s and Dark???s inter-war novels which embody unresolved tensions in a way that challenges representations of the mother-figure by mainstream culture. However, their post-war novels show a greater compliance with nationalist ideologies of the good and healthy mother-figure who conforms more closely with an idealised notion of motherhood, leading up to the 1950s. Through a detailed analysis of the two writers??? changing representations of the mother-figure, I argue that the mother-figure is a key trope through which unspoken tensions and forces that have shaped (and continue to shape) Australian culture and society can be understood.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dark, Eleanor, 1901-1985 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Pritchard, Katharine Susannah, 1883-1969 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="subject">Australian literature -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Women -- Australia -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Feminism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">White women in literature</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23897</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Isotope shift and relativistic shift in atomic spectra</field><field name="creator">Berengut, Julian Carlo, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">At present several groups are analysing quasar absorption spectra to search for variation of the fine structure constant, alpha, across space and time. These studies compare the wavelengths of several transitions observed in the absorption clouds with those seen in the laboratory, and interpret anomalies as variation in alpha. One group has already presented evidence that alpha may have been smaller at an early epoch. Other groups using different telescopes see no variation. These studies use the ???many-multiplet??? method, which relies on the utilisation of many transitions in many ions to enhance the size of the effects and remove sources of systematic error. While this method offers an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity over the previously used alkali-doublet method, the alpha-dependence (relativistic shift) of every transition used in the analysis must be calculated ab initio. In this thesis we present a method for the precise calculation of relativistic shifts, based on an energy calculation involving combination of the configuration interaction method and many-body perturbation theory. The many-multiplet method also introduces a potential systematic error: if the relative isotope abundances of the absorbers differ from terrestrial abundances then there can be spurious shifts in the measured wavelengths, which may be incorrectly interpreted as variation of alpha. A ???conspiracy??? of several isotopic abundances may provide an alternative explanation for the observed spectral anomalies. To account for these systematic errors we need accurate values of the isotope shift. We calculate these shifts using the finite-field method to reduce the problem to that of an energy calculation, which in turn is done using the same method used for the relativistic shift. We present the results of our calculations for a variety of atoms and ions seen in quasar absorption spectra. The results of this research should allow astrophysicists to measure isotope abundances in the absorbers directly. This can provide a test for models of nuclear reactions in stars and supernovae, and of the chemical evolution of the Universe. Our calculations can also be used in conjunction with measurements to extract changes in nuclear charge radii between isotopes.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">alpha variation</field><field name="subject">isotope shift</field><field name="subject">relativistic shift</field><field name="subject">spectrum analysis</field><field name="subject">isotopes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23900</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Dissolution of iron oxides by oxalic acid</field><field name="creator">Lee, Sung Oh, School of Chemical Engineering &amp; Industrial Chemistry, UNSW</field><field name="description">The iron content of industrial minerals can be reduced by physical and chemical processing. Chemical processing is very efficient to achieve a high degree of iron removal at minimum operating cost. Both inorganic acids and organic acids have been used for clay refining. However, due to environmental pollution and contamination of products with the SO42- and Cl-, inorganic acids should be avoided as much as possible. This research investigated the use of oxalic acid to dissolve iron oxides and the dissolution characteristics of natural iron oxides. The dissolution of iron oxides in oxalic acid was found to be very slow at temperatures ranging from 25??? to 60???, but increased rapidly at a temperature above 90oC with increasing oxalic acid concentration, whereas the pH caused the reaction rate to decrease at pH&amp;gt2.5 and improved the rate from pH 1 to pH 2.5. The iron oxides such as goethite (??-FeOOH), lepidocrocite (??-FeOOH) and iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)3) can be dissolved faster at the presence of magnetite which exhibits an induction period at the initial stage and showed the bell-shaped curves for the dissolution. In titration tests, however, the increase of temperature causes an increase in solubility of the oxalate complexes, resulting in an increased stability of ionized species in solution. During the addition of NaOH, NaHC2O4???H2O was precipitated without forming Na2C2O4???H2O, but it was re-dissolved at pH&amp;gt4.0. On the other hand with NH4OH, NH4HC2O4???H2O and (NH4) 2C2O4???H2O co-precipitated at pH 0.93, but also re-dissolved at over pH 2.03. The reaction temperature was found not to affect the removal of iron from the ferric oxalate complex solution using lime. Iron is removed as iron hydroxide and calcium oxalate is then precipitated during the iron removal step. The formation of Fe(OH)3 in the solution was affected by the dissociation of Ca(OH)2. The thermodynamics of sodium, ammonium and iron oxalate complexes were investigated and the standard free energy, ??Go was calculated using thermodynamic data and solubility products. The dissolution of pure hematite by oxalate was found to follow a shrinking core model of which the kinetic step of the reaction is the controlled mechanism.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23924</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Inheritance and expectations: the ambivalence of the colonial orphan figure in post-colonial re-writings of Charles Dickens???s Great Expectations.</field><field name="creator">Sugano, Motoko, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis considers the colonial literary relationship between the ???centre??? and the ???margin??? in the field of post-colonial counter-discourse. As such, this thesis investigates the possibility of disrupting the dominance of Empire, which is often rhetorically constructed through the certainty of the parent and child binary relationship. By analysing the orphan???s affiliational associations, which exist beyond the traditional binary of parent and child in the colonial relationship, I argue that the orphan, as both figure and trope, becomes a site of resistance to the dominant colonial discourse. Re-reading Charles Dickens???s Great Expectations with two Australian re-writings of his text in mind ??? Peter Carey???s Jack Maggs and Gail Jones???s Sixty Lights ??? this thesis investigates the particular case of post-colonial counter-discursive practice, and explores the way in which the orphan figure in each re-writing inscribes their expectations and thereby refigures the power hierarchy between the canonical European text and the post-colonial re-writing. In order to do so, I have organised this thesis into four main chapters, each of which develops a specific interrogation of the orphan figure in light of post-colonial theory and criticism. So, chapter one considers the colonial figure and the trope of parent and child, investigating the influence that this trope wields in casting the racialised colonial Other as ???savage??? and ???primitive???, but, ultimately, ???child-like???. Chapter two furthers this observation by highlighting the disruptive affect of such naturalised perspectives of the colonial Other???evidenced in post-colonial theory through the motion of the key concepts of ambivalence and abjection. And, it is in this context that chapters three and four stand as direct examinations of the disruptive affect of the orphan figure. Discussing Peter Carey???s Jack Maggs and Gail Jones???s Sixty Lights (respectively), these last two chapters formalise the subversive agency assumed by the orphan, and locate it in the very practice of ???writing back to the centre???.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Please verify keywords.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23927</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Little terrors:the child???s threat to social order in the Victorian bildungsroman</field><field name="creator">Roberts, Timothy Paul, English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is a study of rebellious child protagonists in Victorian bildungsroman.  It discusses five novels ??? Jane Eyre, The Mill on the Floss, What Maisie Knew, Vanity Fair and Kim ??? that feature ???radical child??? protagonists who use indirect methods of narrative control to resist conservative models of character development.   It argues that these novels form a subset of subversive English bildungsromane, which threaten the genre???s traditionally liberal values. Theories of narrative desire, reader seduction and discursive manipulation are used to reveal how the radical child in the Victorian bildungsroman takes command of the reader???s sympathy and gains power over the realist text, despite its physical and social powerlessness.  Especially important is the presence of a fantasy counterplot, which coexists with, and ultimately undermines, the bildungsroman???s realistic surface narrative of successful socialisation.  The counterplot allows radical child protagonists to develop in a non-linear manner that contradicts bourgeois ideals of stable progress.  Focusing instead on sites of rupture between the individual and society, subversive bildungsromane resist both the dialectical model of character, which aims to harmoniously unite the protagonist with the realist world, and the dialogic model of interaction, which requires the restriction of personal liberty for the common good.  This rebellious child in the Victorian bildungsroman thus represents an assault on the genre???s democratic ideals.  Rejecting compromise, the radical child replaces the bildungsroman???s central ethic of interpersonal responsibility with an individualistic ethic of domination.  Indeed, the thesis argues that the appeal of such child protagonistslies in their rejection of the obligatory, but anticlimactic, exchange of freedom for security that underpins the realist bildungsroman???s social contract, a rejection attractive to the reader precisely because it is unrealisable in reality. Finally, the thesis compares this radical child with the Gothic monster.  While the monster is punished for its subversion, the radical child???s counterplot enables it to enact most of its subversive desires unpunished.  The conservative English bildungsroman thus becomes a more effective way of representing asocial energies than the more obviously radical Gothic genre, which openly displays its anti-democratic sentiments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Children in Literature; English Fiction - 19th Century - History and criticism; Bront??</field><field name="subject">Charlotte</field><field name="subject">1816-1855 -- Criticism and interpretation; Eliot</field><field name="subject">George</field><field name="subject">1819-1880 -- Criticism and interpretation; James</field><field name="subject">Henry</field><field name="subject">1843-1916 -- Criticism and interpretation; Thackeray</field><field name="subject">William Makepeace</field><field name="subject">1811-1863 -- Criticism and interpretation; Kipling</field><field name="subject">Rudyard</field><field name="subject">1865-1936 -- Criticism and interpretation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23930</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Journey</field><field name="creator">Li, Wenmin, School of Arts, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Journey??? as a term in the dictionary, indicates a distance covered in travelling, usually by land, from one place to another.

Since all experiences take place in time and space, the two categories provide a comprehensive framework, in which my thoughts have a place to occur and develop.

Contemporary Australian representations that return the tourist gaze</field><field name="creator">Vogler, Agnes, School of English, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis adopts post-colonial theory as a reading strategy to address both fiction and interdisciplinary critical writing on the subject of tourism. The introduction argues for the viability of this methodology, highlighting similarities between the ideological underpinnings of tourism and imperialism, especially in relation to the power of the gaze. The first chapter draws on analyses of early exploration and travel writing to advance the argument that as the ideology of empire was encoded in travel writing, so contemporary tourist culture, in so far as it has inherited this discourse, continues to operate within it. I suggest that in much the same way as the explorer???s gaze was a form of creating knowledge disseminated through writing, fiction constitutes a cultural production that contests the power of the gaze. The second chapter focuses on the ambivalent effects of the commodification of culture caused by the tourist industry. I argue that cultural tourism, centred on heritage and history, has constituted a platform from which to review conventional representations of Australian history in a way that demonstrates the relevance of heritage to contemporary national narratives. The third and final chapter examines the relationship between cultural performances in tourism and subject formation, contending that the repetitive nature of performance offers an ideal opportunity to interpolate transformative views of both locals and tourists into the conventional tourist discourse.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23948</field></doc><doc><field name="title">In the trenches: a comparative analysis of the nature and effectiveness of the mobilisation of law by domestic human rights NGOs in the United States, Britain and Germany.</field><field name="creator">Calnan, Scott, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis critically compares how domestic human rights NGOs (DNGOs) in the United States, Britain and Germany use (or mobilise) law to enforce human rights standards and proposes a method to measure their effectiveness in doing so. To do this it draws upon both case studies and literature from many disciplines. On the basis of the data and the literature it finds that, despite their great diversity, DNGOs in each jurisdiction show general similarities in their ???styles??? of operation and use of the law. It also finds that their effectiveness in enforcing human rights can be ascertained with reasonable accuracy and that a DNGO???s size and access to resources does not necessarily correlate with its effectiveness. The context in which the above questions were investigated was one in which there existed very little literature that examined the work of DNGOs (as opposed to international NGOs) as well as few theoretical approaches that would allow their activities to be critically examined and compared. It was also a context in which there was a great deal of discussion in the literature about the crucial importance of DNGOs in human rights enforcement and a growing suspicion that Globalisation might be making their role even more important than it was in the past. To address these issues the author used case studies to supply the necessary detail and a method using ???ideal types??? to assess the data. He also proposed a method to measure DNGO effectiveness so that the case studies could be more thoroughly compared and their true success in human rights enforcement revealed. Despite the incredible diversity among DNGOs the author was able to draw a few useful conclusions about how successful DNGOs operate. In response to these conclusions the author proposed that one possible route by which DNGOs could improve their effectiveness was to transplant their characteristics between jurisdictions. The author also found some evidence that Globalisation was having an effect on DNGOs and proposed some ways in which individual case studies could take advantage of this.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human rights advocacy - Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Human rights workers - United States - Great Britain - Germany</field><field name="subject">Civil rights - Societies, etc. - United States - Great Britain - Germany.</field><field name="subject">Non-governmental organizations - United States - Great Britain - Germany.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23951</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Genetic testing in the age of anxiety. From rhetoric to narrative.</field><field name="creator">Leontini, Rose, School of Sociology, UNSW</field><field name="description">The debate on genetic testing for Huntington???s disease has been dominated heavily by the bioethical and biomedical discourses. Yet upon analysis, both discourses are highly inadequate for understanding the complexity of the difficult choices people are faced with, and the inter-personal relations that are central to decisions regarding the uptake of genetic tests. The purpose of this thesis is two-fold. Firstly, to conduct a theoretically-informed critical analysis of the existing bioethical discourse on genetic testing for Huntington???s disease, that draws primarily on the work of contemporary feminist thinkers. Secondly, to explore how people with a genetic risk for Huntington???s disease negotiate the available choices between certainty and uncertainty; how they experience the liminality of ???being at risk??? in everyday life; how they manage their social environments; and how they interpret their own situation. The matter of ???choice??? is heightened because of the ready availability of genetic testing for Huntington???s disease, and the moral rhetoric that accompanies the provision of genetic services. Empirically, the research draws on the narratives by eleven people with a family history of Huntington???s disease, through which they discuss their fears of living in the shadow of the fatal disease, and consider their choices on reproduction and genetic testing. Their narratives will be analysed through the work of Foucault and Goffman, as well as a wide range of contemporary sociologists.The thesis being proposed is that decisions on genetic testing cannot be said to be ???individual???, but are instead dispersed among the social relations between the self and others, reflecting and transforming the values, competing desires, and the discourses that are prevalent in their social worlds. This is achieved through the discursive production of a web of narratives through which both individuals and institutions attempt to govern, with varying degrees of success, the implications of this relatively new field of knowledge.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Huntington's chorea -- Genetic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23954</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Achromatic and chromatic VEPs in adults with down syndrome</field><field name="creator">Lloyd, Robyn, School of Optometry &amp; Visual Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous studies have found that spatial processing in children and adults with Down syndrome is different in comparison to the normal population. Some previous studies have also found that there is a high prevalence of colour vision deficiencies in people with Down syndrome. The aim of the present study was to use an objective test, the transient visual evoked potential (VEP), to assess achromatic and chromatic visual processing in adults with Down syndrome. Achromatic VEPs were recorded in response to black-white stimuli presented in patternreversal mode. Chromatic VEPs were recorded in response to two types of colour pattern, presented in pattern onset-offset mode. The two colour types were intended to preferentially stimulate the two principal chromatic pathways of the visual system, the ???redgreen??? and ???blue-yellow??? colour-opponent pathways. These stimuli are here termed the ???LM??? and ???S-(L+M) stimuli, respectively, reflecting the cone types that input to the pathways they are intended to stimulate. Each subject also completed two subjective colour vision tests, the Colour Vision Test Made Easy (CVTME) and the City University Colour Vision Test (CUT). Morphology of the achromatic and chromatic VEPs was found to differ between the group with Down syndrome and an age-matched control group. The latency of the P100 component of the achromatic VEP was found to be significantly later in the group with Down syndrome compared to the control group (the N75 latency was earlier in the group with Down syndrome, but not significantly so). The group-averaged peak-to-peak amplitude of the achromatic VEP was significantly lower in the group with Down syndrome compared to the control group. The major positive component of the VEP in response to the L-M stimulus was of significantly longer latency compared to that of the control group. The major negative component and the peak-to-peak amplitude of this response were not significantly different between the groups. For the response to S-(L+M) stimuli, the latency of the major negativity was significantly earlier in the group with Down syndrome and the major positivity was later, but not significantly so. Amplitude of this response was significantly higher in adults with Down syndrome compared to the control group. Most subjects in both groups passed both the CVTME and CUT. Our findings indicate that chromatic VEPs are abnormal in Down syndrome, and this may reflect abnormal processing of chromatic stimuli in this population. Alternatively, these abnormalities may arise due to abnormal cortical morphology, which may occur with normal or abnormal processing of chromatic signals. These findings further indicate that abnormality of chromatic VEPs may be expected in Down syndrome, and is not necessarily indicative of pathology or other abnormal function that is unrelated to the syndrome.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Visual evoked response</field><field name="subject">Optics</field><field name="subject">Down syndrome</field><field name="subject">Evoked potentials, Visual</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23957</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Thinking jurisdictionally: a genealogy of native title</field><field name="creator">Dorsett, Shaunnagh, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">In Mabo v. State of Queensland (No. 2) (1992) 175 C.L.R. 1, the majority of the High Court held that ???native title??? had survived the acquisition of sovereignty over the Australian continent and is ???recognised??? by the common law. However, all the judgments failed to articulate clearly either the nature of native title as a legal form, and the relationship of that legal form to the common law, or what is meant by ???recognition???. Twelve years later the High Court has still not provided a satisfactory understanding of any of these matters. The central problem investigated by this thesis is the nature of that relationship and of the legal interest of native title. It is contended that this relationship can be understood and ordered as a matter of jurisdiction. This thesis seeks to recuperate a substantive concept of jurisdiction, and specifically of a particular jurisdiction, that of the common law, and to demonstrate how the interest of native title results from the jurisdictional relationship between common law and indigenous law. Part I is a genealogy of native title, drawn out through a history of ideas about common law jurisdiction. It is an account of the legal practice of jurisdiction, through a conceptual elaboration of a particular jurisdiction: the common law. This part traces the history of the common law from its origins in a pluralistic, fragmented, jurisdictional landscape, to its current position as the ???law of the land???. It considers the traditional mechanisms and techniques through which the common law has ordered its relationships with other jurisdictions, and how it has appropriated matters traditionally within the purview of other jurisdictions, accommodating them within the common law as ???custom???. The thesis demonstrates that the same gestures and practices can be seen in modern native title decisions, and contends that the ordering which underpins both native title, and the Australian legal system, is jurisdictional. Part II examines the practice of jurisdiction through an examination of three technologies of jurisdiction, all of which contributed to the construction of the legal entity of native title as an act of jurisdiction: mapping, accommodation and categorisation.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Common law -- History</field><field name="subject">Native title (Australia)</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Legal status, laws, etc</field><field name="subject">Indigenous peoples -- Legal status, laws, etc</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23963</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Heidegger and the problem of individuation: Mitsein (being-with), ethics and responsibility</field><field name="creator">Sorial, Sarah, School of Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">The argument of this thesis is that Heideggerian individuation does not constitute another form of solipsism and is not incongruent with Heidegger???s account of Mitsein (beingwith). By demonstrating how individuation is bound up with Mitsein I will also argue that this concept of individuation contains an ethics, conceived here as responsibility for one???s Being/existence that nevertheless implicates others. By tracing the trajectory of Heidegger???s thinking from Being and Time to the later text, Time and Being, I want to suggest that the meditation on Being and its relation to Dasein as an individual contains an ethical moment. Ethics, not conceived of as a series of proscriptions, in terms of the Kantian Categorical Imperative for example. Nor ethics conceived in terms of an obligation to and responsibility for another, as in Levinasian ethics, but an ethics in terms of responsibility for existence, and more specifically, for one???s own existence. The ethical moment in Heidegger, I argue, is not one as ambitious as changing the world or assuming infinite and numerous obligations on behalf of others. It is, rather, a question of changing oneself. It is a question of assuming responsibility in response to the call of Being. I will show how, given that Dasein is always Mitsein, others are situated in such an ethics. Central to the thesis is an examination of the relation between indivduation and Mitsein. While Heidegger is always careful to distinguish his form of individuation from other accounts of individuation or solipsism, such as those of Rene Descartes, Immanuel Kant or Edmund Husserl???s, Heidegger???s conception of solipsism and its relation to his account  of Mitsein remains somewhat obscure. As a consequence, there are several problems that this concept raises, all of which have been the subject of much debate. At the centre of this debate is the apparent tension between the concept of individuation and the notion that ontologically, Dasein is also a Mitsein. This tension has led to a number of interpretations, which either argue that the concept of individuation is inconsistent with the notion of Mitsein, or that it constitutes yet another instance of Cartesian subjectivity and that as a consequence, it is inherently unethical. This thesis contributes to this debate by submitting that the concept of individuation, while primary or central to Heidegger???s ontology, is not in tension with his account of Mitsein. I use Jean-Luc Nancy???s paradoxical logic of the singular to argue for this claim. I suggest that it is precisely this concept of individuation that can inform an ethics and theory of political action on account of the emphasis on individual responsibility. The second part of my argument, also made with the aid of Nancy, is that this can inform an ethics and a theory of political action, not at level of making moral judgements, or yielding standards of right and wrong, but at the level of individual and by implication, collective responsibility for one???s own existence. Given that there is no real separation between the ontic and ontological levels in Heidegger???s work, a taking responsibility at the level of one???s own Being will invariably play itself out ontically in factical life in terms of moral responsibility and judgement. I explore the concrete political implications of this through an examination of Heidegger???s account of freedom. I argue that Heidegger???s removal of freedom from the  ontology of self-presence and his alternative conception of it provides us with a way of thinking freedom not in terms of a specific set of rights, but as a mode of being-in-theworld and as the basis for collective political action. I use the work of Hannah Arendt to develop a theory of political action, freedom and judgment from this revisionary conception of freedom.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Heidegger, Martin, 1889-1976</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23966</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Overlapping in Japanese conversation: communication styles of Japanese long-term residents of Australia in terms of Japanese socio-cultural/gender norms</field><field name="creator">Iida, Sumiko, Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This study analyses overlaps in naturally occurring multi-party conversations among Japanese long-term residents of Australia, to investigate how Australian culture influences their Japanese communication style. One of the study???s interests is how their gendered communication styles appear in Australian English culture. Japanese gendered communication styles have been discussed in the literature, for example that males interrupt females more than vice versa; active participation by males versus passive participation by females in mixed-gender conversations; self-oriented topic initiation by males versus other-oriented topic initiation by females etc. These styles were assumed to be rarely observed in their L1 communication styles in Australia, where English, in which gendered language is less distinctive than Japanese, is spoken, and gender-free society has been more emphasised and practiced than in Japan. Among conversations recorded by the two informants, three multi-party conversations per informant (i.e. six in total) were selected, in which over 2000 overlaps are observed. The study first established a framework of functional overlap classification in terms of the ownership of the conversational floor. Then, based on this frame, all overlaps were classified into a number of functional categories, and were analysed qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The results showed little differences in the Japanese communication styles of the long-term residents of Australia from the Japanese communication styles which have been discussed in the literature, such as frequent use of aizuchi and other cooperative overlaps at and other than at Transition Relevance Places. As for gendered communication style, at least socio-cultural norms between traditional Japanese husband and wife are observed in the informants??? communication style. Although a number of variables that surround the informants need to be considered, the results may suggest that Japanese socio-cultural norms are, at this stage, more stable and they maintain the communication style of the Japanese long-term residents of foreign culture in their first language communication more strongly than was expected. However, different trends may be observed in future.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japanese -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Communication</field><field name="subject">Conversation</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23975</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A study of hybridisation of DNA immobilised on gold: strategies for DNA biosensing</field><field name="creator">Mearns, Freya Justine, Chemistry, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis outlines a study of the physical changes that hybridisation imposes on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) immobilised by one end to a substrate, and of how such physical changes can be exploited to detect specific sequences of DNA in a target solution. The system studied was composed of a mixed monolayer of 20mer ssDNA with C6 alkanethiolate modifications on their 3??? ends and short-chain hydroxyterminated alkanethiolates, on a gold substrate. It was prepared using the self-assembly properties of alkanethiols on gold.  Atomic force microscopy images showed that the end-immobilised ssDNA is flexible enough to lie over the diluent hydroxy-terminated self-assembled monolayer (SAM). Hybridisation was shown to cause the DNA to become more rigid and stand up off the substrate due to an increase in persistence length. Such physical changes of the DNA upon hybridisation were significant enough to be exploited in the development of a DNA recognition interface.  The recognition interface was designed with the view of keeping it both simple to make and simple to use, and was coupled with electrochemical transduction. A label-free recognition interface was developed that relied on the oxidation of the sulfur head group of the alkanethiolate SAM to detect hybridisation (firstly air oxidation and then electrochemical oxidation). It produced a positive signal upon hybridisation with complementary target DNA.  Improvements in the reliability and robustness of the recognition interface were made using a labelled approach. The labelled version employed electroactive molecules as labels on the 5??? ends of the probe DNA strands. Two labels were investigated ??? anthraquinone and ferrocene. The flexibility of the ssDNA ensured that the redox labels were able to directly access the underlying gold electrode. Hybridisation was expected to remove the labels from the electrode due to an increase in the DNA???s persistence length, and thus perturb the electrochemical signal. The use of ferrocene as a label provided a ???proof-of-concept??? for the system. The labelled recognition interface provides a foundation for the future development of a simple, reliable, and selective DNA hybridisation biosensor.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">DNA</field><field name="subject">hybridisation</field><field name="subject">biosensor</field><field name="subject">electrodes</field><field name="subject">electrochemistry</field><field name="subject">SAMs</field><field name="subject">self assembly</field><field name="subject">monolayers</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23978</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A force for Federation: international exhibitions and the formation of Australian ethos (1851-1901)</field><field name="creator">Orr, Kirsten, School of Architecture, UNSW</field><field name="description">In 1879 the British Colony of New South Wales hosted the first international exhibition in the Southern Hemisphere.  This was immediately followed by the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1880 in the colony of Victoria and the success of these exhibitions inspired the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, which was held in 1888 to celebrate the centenary of white settlement in Australia.  My thesis is that these international exhibitions had a profound impact on the development of our cities, the evolution of an Australian ethos and the gaining of nationhood.  The immense popularity and comprehensive nature of the exhibitions made them the only major events in late nineteenth-century Australia that brought the people together in an almost universally shared experience.  The exhibitions conveyed official ideologies from the organising elites to ordinary people and encouraged the dissemination of new cultural sentiments, political aspirations, and moral and educational ideals.  Many exhibition commissioners, official observers and ideologues were also predominantly involved in the Federation movement and the wider cultural sphere.  The international exhibitions assisted the development of an Australian urban ethos, which to a large extent replaced the older pastoral / frontier image.  Many of the more enduring ideas emanating from the exhibitions were physically expressed in the consequent development of our cities ??? particularly Sydney and Melbourne, both of which had achieved metropolitan status and global significance by the end of the nineteenth century.  The new urban ethos, dramatically triggered by Sydney 1879, combined with and strengthened the national aspirations and sentiments of the Federation movement.  Thus the exhibitions created an immediate connection between colonial pride in urban development and European and American ideals of nation building.  They also created an increasing cultural sophistication and a growing involvement in social movements and political associations at the national level.  The international exhibitions, more than any other single event, convinced the colonials that they were all Australians together and that their destiny was to be united as one nation.  At that time, Australians began to think about national objectives.  The exhibitions not only promulgated national sentiment and a new ethos, but also provided opportunities for independent colonial initiatives, inter-colonial cooperation and a more equal position in the imperial alliance.  Thus they became a powerful impetus, hitherto unrecognised, for the complex of social, political and economic developments that made Federation possible.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">National characteristics Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia politics &amp; government 1851-1901</field><field name="subject">city planning Australia history</field><field name="subject">Architecture Australia 19th century</field><field name="subject">Sydney International Exhibition (1879: Sydney</field><field name="subject">NSW)</field><field name="subject">Melbourne International Exhibition (1880-81: Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Vic)</field><field name="subject">Melbourne Centennial International Exhibition (1888-89: Melbourne</field><field name="subject">Vic)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23987</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A proposed security protocol for data gathering mobile agents</field><field name="creator">Al-Jaljouli, Raja, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">We address the security issue of the data which mobile agents gather as they are traversing the Internet. Our goal is to devise a security protocol that truly secures the data which mobile agents gather. Several cryptographic protocols were presented in the literature asserting the security of gathered data. Formal verification of the protocols reveals unforeseen security flaws, such as truncation or alteration of the collected data, breaching the privacy of the gathered data, sending others data under the private key of a malicious host, and replacing the collected data with data of similar agents. So the existing protocols are not truly secure. We present an accurate security protocol which aims to assert strong integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the gathered data. The proposed protocol is derived from the Multi-hops protocol. The protocol suffers from security flaws, e.g. an adversary might truncate/ replace collected data, or sign others data with its own private key without being detected. The proposed protocol refines the Multi-hops protocol by implementing the following security techniques: utilization of co-operating agents, scrambling the gathered offers, requesting a visited host to clear its memory from any data acquired as a result of executing the agent before the host dispatches the agent to the succeeding host in the agent???s itinerary, and carrying out verifications on the identity of the genuine initiator at the early execution of the agent at visited hosts, in addition to the verifications upon the agent???s return to the initiator. The proposed protocol also implements the common security techniques such as public key encryption, digital signature, etc. The implemented security techniques would rectify the security flaws revealed in the existing protocols. We use STA, an infinite-state exploration tool, to verify the security properties of a reasonably small instance of the proposed protocol in key configurations. The analysis using STA reports no attack. Moreover, we carefully reason the correctness of the security protocol for a general model and show that the protocol would be capable of preventing or at least detecting the attacks revealed in the existing protocols.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mobile agents</field><field name="subject">security protocol</field><field name="subject">formal methds</field><field name="subject">information security</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/23999</field></doc><doc><field name="title">New concepts in tailgate strata behaviour and implications for support design</field><field name="creator">Tarrant, Gregory Colin, Mining, UNSW</field><field name="description">Tailgate stability within longwall coal mining is critical to longwall productivity and safety of mine personnel.   A mechanistic model was developed and tested to explain observed high deformation tailgate behaviour characterised by lateral strata movement.   Field investigations were conducted at three Australian longwall mines with an emphasis on the measurement of; horizontal strata movement about gateroads during longwall extraction, and the load/deformation characteristics of standing supports.   3D numerical modelling was used to simulate tailgate deformation, and interaction of various support types and design strategies.   The sensitivity of strata and support behaviour to; variations in roof geology, strength of sliding interfaces, depth of cover, pre-mining horizontal stress magnitude and orientation, and strength and stiffness characteristics of standing supports was modelled.   Laboratory investigations of a standing support product, the ???Can???, at reduced scale (one third) were conducted.   The tests determined the loading mechanics of the product and provided a basis for optimisation of the engineering properties (strength and stiffness).   Horizontal strata movement about longwall extraction was found to have a significant impact on strata behaviour at two of the three mines investigated.   The term ???skew roof??? was coined to describe the deformation process.   Essentially the roof strata was found to ???skew??? towards the approaching goaf.   The key geotechnical factors found to control the skew roof mechanism were; magnitude and orientation of the pre-mining horizontal stress, presence of weak interfaces along which sliding could occur, and shear strength of the interfaces.   Measurement of the nature and extent of skew roof deformation specific to each mine provided a sound engineering basis for support design.   These included; the relative roles of long tendons versus standing support, optimal pattern (position across and along the roadway) of standing supports, and appropriate strength and stiffness characteristics.   The findings were successfully implemented at Metropolitan Colliery in particular, where adequate tailgate serviceability has been achieved within a high deformation environment, and whilst maintaining a relatively small chain pillar width.   The research has achieved an alternative to empirical and trial and error tailgate support design methods.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Longwall mining</field><field name="subject">Mine roof control</field><field name="subject">Coal mines and mining</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Transglutaminase II: an integrator of fibroblast adhesion pathways in wound healing.</field><field name="creator">Mearns, Bryony Megan, BABS, UNSW</field><field name="description">Transglutaminase II (TG2) is a complex protein with five different reported activities.  Increases in TG2 expression and TGase activity have previously been observed during wound healing in rat studies; however, it has been unclear whether these phenomena were directly involved in the healing process or if they were simply a by-product of it.  The aims of this thesis were, thus, to determine if TG2 plays a role in wound healing in vivo and to elucidate the mechanism of any effects TG2 may have at the cellular level.  TG2 ablation resulted in delayed wound healing.  To gain mechanistic insight into this abnormality, primary fibroblast cultures from TG2-knockout and wildtype mouse embryos were analysed.  TG2-null fibroblasts displayed decreased adhesion and integrin signalling during initial stages of adhesion.  Intriguingly, TG2-null cells showed faster activation of Rac1 and RhoA in response to adhesion.  Long-term adhesion of TG2-null fibroblasts resulted in increased basal phosphorylation of FAK and number of paxillin-stained focal adhesions, enhanced PI3-kinase signalling, faster actin dynamics and altered activation of p44/42 MAPK.  These results are indicative of futile cycling of intracellular signalling pathways resulting from reduced focal adhesion turnover in the TG2-knockout fibroblasts.  Rescue experiments demonstrated that TG2-mediated effects on cell adhesion occurred in the extracellular environment and that neither GTP-binding nor TGase activity is required for these effects.  Results further showed that a ???compact??? conformation of TG2 was not required for this role of TG2.  Interestingly, addition of recombinant TG2 to the extracellular environment increased cell spreading of TG2-null cells to a level far greater than that seen in wildtype cells, which did not increase their spreading in response to exogenous TG2.  Demonstration of faster activation of the small GTPases in the TG2-null MEFs, and the apparent inhibition of exogenous TG2???s extracellular effects on cell spreading by endogenous protein in the wildtype cells, provide tantalising evidence for a role for intracellular TG2 in regulating activation of the small GTPases to promote efficient fibroblast migration.  This work identifies TG2 as a facilitator of efficient wound closure through extracellular effects on integrin-mediated signalling and intracellular effects on activation of the small GTPases.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">transglutaminase</field><field name="subject">adhesion</field><field name="subject">cell spreading</field><field name="subject">wound healing</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24166</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Monetary policy in Japan's 'Great Recession:' neo-Wicksellian and monetarist approaches</field><field name="creator">Kirchner, Stephen Ian Leslie, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis examines the problems posed by Japan???s recent macroeconomic experience for conventional monetary policy theory and practice.  Japan???s experience with deflation and the zero lower bound for nominal official interest rates is placed in the context of neo-Wicksellian and monetarist interpretations of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  The neo-Wicksellian approach to the zero bound problem is shown to suffer significant limitations in view of Japan???s experience, while a monetarist interpretation of the transmission mechanism is shown to be more robust.  The thesis considers the role of the official interest rate and the money base in vector autoregression  models of the Japanese economy, finding that the economy became less amenable to effective stabilisation by monetary policy from the early 1990s onwards.  A new approach to estimating a neo-Wicksellian monetary policy rule for the Bank of Japan is proposed and the robustness of the parameters of this rule determined.  The thesis motivates a role for the money base in the determination of real output and inflation.  A policy rule in the growth rate of the nominal money base is estimated and the stability of its parameters with respect to a hypothesised structural break and changes in the governorship of the Bank of Japan is considered.  Aggregate demand and supply specifications for the Japanese economy are estimated that show a distinct role for the money base that is independent of the official interest rate.  These specifications are extended to develop a model of the Japanese economy.  The model is distinctive in incorporating both neo-Wicksellian and monetarist views of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  The macroeconomic stabilisation properties of various interest rate and money base growth rules are compared in the context of the model, using stochastic simulation methods.  In particular, a policy rule in the growth rate of the nominal money base with the nominal official interest rate set to zero is simulated and shown to have macroeconomic stabilisation properties that compare favourably to conventional interest rate rules.  The thesis concludes that the neglect of money in contemporary monetary policy theory and practice is mistaken in view of Japan???s recent macroeconomic experience.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="subject">economy</field><field name="subject">monetary policy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24169</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A systematic analysis of consumer buyer behaviour in urban China</field><field name="creator">Kwok, Simon, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has experienced rapid economic growth and is now arguably the world???s largest consumer market. However, despite the size and potential of the Chinese market, there is a serious lack of formal understanding of Chinese buyer behaviour. The broad aim of this research is to understand patterns of buyer behaviour through a systematic analysis of the purchasing of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) by urban Chinese consumers. Several specific research questions are addressed: ??? What patterns of brand purchasing and brand loyalty do urban Chinese consumers exhibit? ??? Do these patterns generalise across content, spatial and temporal dimensions? ??? Are there any systematic significant bases of segmentation within the FMCG markets that are studied? ??? What key implications are to be drawn by academics and practitioners? ??? More generally, what is the value of adopting a systematic approach to research in this area of enquiry? ??? Also, what is the value of applying and extending models developed in the West to the Chinese consumer context? The research is divided into two main studies. The first involves secondary consumer panel data and focuses on brand purchasing and loyalty behaviour. Analysis is conducted using the Dirichlet model, which provides theoretical predictions for a range of brand performance measures. The second study involves primary consumer panel data and  examines potential bases of segmentation. Analysis is based on the Generalised Dirichlet Model, which enables the impact of covariates on buyer behaviour to be assessed. It is found that the patterns of Chinese buyer behaviour for FMCGs are generally similar to those in the West. Results unique to the Chinese market are also identified. Importantly, the results and patterns generalise across all dimensions of analysis (that is, for brands within product categories, store types and store chains, and in different regions and cities, and in different time periods). Also, there is a lack of consumer segmentation among directly competing brands within the product categories that are studied. The findings not only make a strong empirical contribution but also have important academic and managerial implications.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">consumer behavior.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Taxonomy and ecology of predatory marine flatworms (Platyhelminthes: Polycladida) in Botany Bay, New South Wales, Australia</field><field name="creator">Lee, Ka-Man, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Marine flatworms are important mobile predators on hard substrate, however little is known about their life history. I recorded seven species of flatworms in Botany Bay and described a new species of flatworm Imogine lateotentare sp. nov. It is distinguished from other species in the same genus by having small, transparent and inconspicuous tentacles and continuous bands of numerous frontal and cerebral eyes. This new flatworm species was found closely associated with the barnacle Balanus variegatus (Darwin, 1854) on which it fed. Marine flatworms provide elaborate parental care to their offspring but its significance has not been experimentally confirmed. I provided quantitative measurements of the significance of parental care behaviour in Echinoplana celerrima and Stylochus pygmaeus under controlled laboratory conditions. I also examined the changes in reproductive behaviour of E. celerrima and the hatching success of their eggs when exposed to three putative flatworm egg predators. Brooding behaviour of neither species of flatworm enhanced the hatching success of their eggs and exposure of E. celerrima to the potential egg predators did not affect the timing of hatching or hatching success of its eggs. However, E. celerrima spent more time guarding their eggs when exposed to the potential egg predators. Brooding may be an innate behaviour in marine flatworms but it is not essential to their reproductive success. Marine flatworms are closely associated with sessile organisms and these assemblages are common in bays and estuaries which are subject to anthropogenic inputs from various sources. Impacts of pollutants are known for many flatworm prey species but little is known about the effects on the flatworm themselves. I examined the influence of sublethal concentrations of copper ranging from 0 to 50 ??g L-1 on the predatory and reproductive behaviour of Stylochus pygmaeus. These worms were more sensitive to low levels of copper pollution than their barnacle preys. Response of flatworms to physical stimulation, number of egg batches laid and hatching success were greatly reduced at higher copper concentrations. In areas polluted by heavy metals, flatworm populations will be affected at lower concentrations than their barnacle prey and which may alter sessile invertebrate community structure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polycladida -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Platyhelminthes</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24178</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Personality and the prediction of work performance: artificial neural networks versus linear regression</field><field name="creator">Minbashian, Amirali, Psychology, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Previous research that has evaluated the effectiveness of personality variables for predicting work performance has predominantly relied on methods designed to detect simple relationships. The research reported in this thesis employed artificial neural networks ??? a method that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear and configural relationships among variables ??? and the findings were compared to those obtained by the more traditional method of linear regression. Six datasets that comprise a range of occupations, personality inventories, and work performance measures were used as the basis of the analyses. A series of studies were conducted to compare the predictive performance of prediction equations that a) were developed using either artificial neural networks or linear regression, and b) differed with respect to the type and number of personality variables that were used as predictors of work performance. Studies 1 and 2 compared the two methods using individual personality variables that assess the broad constructs of the five-factor model of personality. Studies 3 and 4 used combinations of these broad variables as the predictors. Study 5 employed narrow personality variables that assess specific facets of the broad constructs. Additional methodological contributions include the use of a resampling procedure, the use of multiple measures of predictive performance, and the comparison of two procedures for developing neural networks. Across the studies, it was generally found that the neural networks were rarely able to outperform the simpler linear regression equations, and this was attributed to the lack of reliable nonlinearity and configurality in personality-work performance relationships. However, the neural networks were able to outperform linear regression in the few instances where there was some independent evidence of nonlinear or configural relationships. Consequently, although the findings do not support the  usefulness of neural networks for specifically improving the effectiveness of personality variables as predictors of work performance, in a broader sense they provide some grounds for optimism for organisational researchers interested in applying this method to investigate and exploit complex relationships among variables.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Neural networks</field><field name="subject">Regression analysis</field><field name="subject">Personality</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and constitutive modelling of monotonic and cyclic loading in variably saturated soils</field><field name="creator">Habte, Michael Andebrhan, Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">A fully coupled, effective stress based elasto-plastic model is presented for a rigorous analysis of flow and deformation in variably saturated porous media subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. The governing equations are derived based on the effective stress concept, equations of equilibrium, and conservation equations of mass and momentum using a systematic macroscopic approach. Both elastic and elasto-plastic constitutive equations are developed. All model coefficients are identified in terms of measurable parameters. The governing equations presented are general in nature, embodying all previously presented formulations in the field. A unified bounding surface plasticity model is developed to describe the stress-strain behaviour of variably saturated soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loading. The model is formulated incrementally within the critical state framework using the effective stress approach. The model takes into account the effects of both plastic volumetric strain and matric suction on the hardening of the bounding surface.  Cyclic behaviour is captured through a new mapping rule in which the point of stress reversal is taken as the centre of projection. The effect of particle crushing at high stresses is considered through a three-segmented critical state and isotropic compression lines. A non-associative flow rule is employed to generalise application of the model to all soils.  Solution to the governing equations is obtained numerically using the finite element approach, with the finite difference method employed for the time integration of the rate equations. The elasto-plastic constitutive equations are integrated explicitly using Euler???s forward and the modified Euler integration schemes. Yield surface correction schemes are adopted to improve accuracy of the solution. Essential elements of the proposed model are validated by comparing numerical predictions with experimental data from the literature for fully and partially saturated soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings in drained, undrained, isotropic and deviatoric conditions. The results demonstrate capability of the coupled model to predict essential characteristics of variably saturated soils subjected to monotonic and cyclic loadings in a unified manner.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Soils -- Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Soil science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Abstraction and representation of fields and their applications in biomedical modelling</field><field name="creator">Tsafnat, Guy, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Computer models are used extensively to investigate biological systems. Many of these systems can be described in terms of fields???spatially- and temporally- varying scalar, vector and tensor properties defined over domains. For example, the spatial variation of muscle fibers is a vector field, the spatial and temporal variation in temperature of an organ is a scalar field, and the distribution of stress across muscle tissue is a tensor field. In this thesis I present my research on how to represent fields in a format that allows researchers to store and distribute them independently of models and to investigate and manipulate them intuitively. I also demonstrate how the work can be applied to solving and analysing biomedical models. To represent fields I created a two-layer system. One layer, called the Field Representation Language (FRL), represents fields by storing numeric, analytic and meta data for storage and distribution. The focus of this layer is efficiency rather than usability. The second layer, called the Abstract Field Layer (AFL), provides an abstraction of fields so that they are easier for researchers to work with. This layer also provides common operations for manipulating fields as well as transparent conversion to and from FRL representations. The applications that I used to demonstrate the use of AFL and FRL are (a) a fields visualisation toolkit, (b) integration of models from different scales and solvers, and (c) a solver that uses AFL internally. The layered architecture facilitated the development of tools that use fields. A similar architecture may also prove useful for representations of other modelled entities.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biological models</field><field name="subject">Computer simulation</field><field name="subject">Computer graphics</field><field name="subject">Biological systems</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Optimization of instruction memory for embedded systems</field><field name="creator">Janapsatya, Andhi, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents methodologies for improving system performance and energy consumption by optimizing the memory hierarchy performance. The processor-memory performance gap is a well-known problem that is predicted to get worse, as the performance gap between processor and memory is widening. The author describes a method to estimate the best L1 cache configuration for a given application. In addition, three methods are presented to improve the performance and reduce energy in embedded systems by optimizing the instruction memory. Performance estimation is an important procedure to assess the performance of the system and to assess the effectiveness of any applied optimizations. A cache memory performance estimation methodology is presented in this thesis. The methodology is designed to quickly and accurately estimate the performance of multiple cache memory configurations. Experimental results showed that the methodology is on average 45 times faster compared to a widely used tool (Dinero IV). The first optimization method is a software-only method, called code placement, was implemented to improve the performance of instruction cache memory. The method involves careful placement of code within memory to ensure high cache hit rate when code is brought into the cache memory. Code placement methodology aims to improve cache hit rates to improve cache memory performance. Experimental results show that by applying the code placement method, a reduction in cache miss rate by up to 71%, and energy consumption reduction of up to 63% are observed when compared to application without code placement. The second method involves a novel architecture for utilizing scratchpad memory. The scratchpad memory is designed as a replacement of the instruction cache memory. Hardware modification was designed to allow data to be written into the scratchpad memory during program execution, allowing dynamic control of the scratchpad memory content. Scratchpad memory has a faster memory access time and a lower energy consumption per access compared to cache memory; the usage of scratchpad memory aims to improve performance and lower energy consumption of systems compared to system with cache memory. Experimental results show an average energy reduction of 26.59% and an average performance improvement of 25.63% when compared to a system with cache memory. The third is an application profiling method using statistical information to identify application???s hot-spots. Application profiling is important for identifying section in the application where performance degradation might occur and/or where maximum performance gain can be obtained through optimization. The method was applied and tested on the scratchpad based system described in this thesis. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the analysis method in reducing energy and improving performance when compared to previous method for utilizing the scratchpad memory based system (average performance improvement of 23.6% and average energy reduction of 27.1% are observed).</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Memory management (Computer science)</field><field name="subject">Cache memory</field><field name="subject">Computer architecture</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing El Nino-southern oscillation</field><field name="creator">Gergis, Jo??lle L., School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">El Ni??o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the most important coupled ocean-atmospheric phenomenon to cause global climate variability on interannual time scales. Efforts to understand recent, apparently anomalous ENSO behaviour are hampered by the lack of long, high-quality climate records. While instrumental data generally covers the past 150 years, record length is insufficient for the assessment of past changes in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of ENSO. Here, multiproxy networks of high-resolution tree-ring, coral, ice and documentary records derived from eastern and western Pacific ENSO ???centres of action??? are analysed (A.D. 1525-2002). Considerable improvements in ENSO reconstruction are achieved from expanding the use of records from the western Pacific. In particular, ~500 years of a continuous 3,722 year ENSO sensitive tree-ring record from New Zealand is introduced. Although extreme ENSO events are seen throughout a 478-year discrete event analysis, 43% of extreme, 20% of very strong and 28% of all protracted ENSO events occur within the 20th century. Principal component analysis was used to extend instrumental records of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) Ni??o 3.4 Sea Surface Temperature (Ni??o 3.4 SST) and a newly developed coupled ocean-atmospheric ENSO index (CEI) by 347 years. Significantly, of the three indices reconstructed here, CEI reconstructions were largely found to be the best predictors of ENSO. The results suggest that ENSO may be more effectively characterised using a coupled ocean-atmosphere index, particularly for December-May periods. Compared to the pre-instrumental period, the late 19th and early 20th centuries indicate a clear trend toward increased ENSO variability over the past 150 years. Significantly, spectral analysis of reconstructed indices reveals a marked change in the frequency and intensity of ENSO beginning ~A.D. 1850, coinciding with the end of the Little Ice Age and the boom in global industrialisation. This suggests that ENSO may operate differently under natural (pre-industrial) and anthropogenically influenced background states. This study asserts that recent ENSO variability appears anomalous in the context of the past five centuries. Given the considerable socio-economic impacts of ENSO events, future investigation into the implications an increasingly anthropogenically-warmed world may have on ENSO is vital.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Southern oscillation</field><field name="subject">El Nino Current</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24222</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gras development, approval and implementation in Australia</field><field name="creator">Ely, William Stewart, Surveying &amp; Spatial Information Systems, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This Thesis covers the development of an alternative Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation technology that has become known as the Ground-based Regional Augmentation System (GRAS). GNSS augmentation technologies in support of aviation have largely been developed by countries with large economies such as the USA and members of the European Union. These technologies have focussed on solutions to the specific problems of the host nations, based on the demographics, political and economic factors relevant to them. Outside these countries, the role of GNSS augmentation has largely been ignored, specifically when considering wide area augmentation utilising Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS). SBAS technologies are expensive, and cannot be justified for nations like Australia with a relatively small number of aircraft, operated in a focussed geographic area. Utilising SBAS services provided by another country introduces cultural, legal and institutional issues that are not always easily addressed. GRAS was derived to provide a cost-effective wide area augmentation capability to nations that lacked the economic ability to field SBAS technologies. This work covers the evolution of the GRAS concept, the construction and testing of the GRAS test bed and its associated test avionics, as well as the development of standards needed to support GRAS as an internationally accepted aviation standard. The major outcome from this work was the confirmation that GRAS could meet the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) standards for Approaches with Vertical Guidance Level 2 (APV-II) as well as all less demanding modes of flight. Results from numerous ground and flight tests conducted under this research program have been reviewed by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) GNSS Panel (GNSSP), and been instrumental in the development and validation of Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs) which promulgate how ICAO standardised systems should perform. The final component of this work describes the project management and technology approval processes needed to get an internationally standardised system into operational use, and the particular problems that a small country like Australia has in progressing these tasks on the World stage.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Global Positioning System</field><field name="subject">Artificial satellites in navigation</field><field name="subject">Navigation (Aeronautics)</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24225</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Developing a model for patients??? acceptance of a home telecare management system</field><field name="creator">Rahimpour, Mohammadreza, Graduate School of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Successful implementation of any technology requires acceptance by the users. Numerous studies in the area of information technology acceptance, based on wellknown theories have been conducted to examine technology acceptance models and predict user adoption/acceptance behaviour. There are several studies dealing with patients??? acceptance of different telemedicine applications, but few about the patients??? acceptance of home telecare. Most existing studies are not based on a strong theoretical framework. In this study, based on an extensive literature review and preliminary qualitative data, a theoretical model of the effect of Home Telecare Management System (HTMS) characteristics and psychological variables associated with technophobia on patients??? acceptance of HTMS is proposed. The proposed model is an augmented Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) of Davis (1986), which is called Home Telecare Management System acceptance model (HTMS-AM), in which TAM has been augmented by two constructs: HTMS anxiety and HTMS self-efficacy. The model is proposed to improve our understanding regarding patients??? acceptance of HTMS, which may lead to successful design and implementation of home telecare systems. In addition, it can be used as a theoretical basis to evaluate new generations of HTMS in terms of users acceptance in the early stage of their design and development even prior to implementation. In order to test the reliability and validity of the measures, video demonstrations of a home telecare system and demonstration of a system prototype to potential users was employed. To propose the HTMS-AM the following five stages were taken: 1. General well-known theoretical models of human behaviour from psychology and technology acceptance models from information technology were reviewed to create a basic template for the proposed model. 2. A preliminary study (focus group interviews, Chapter 5) was conducted to assess patients??? perceptions of HTMS.  3. Based on an extensive literature review and findings from preliminary qualitative studies, HTMS acceptance model was proposed, to improve our understanding about factors, which may affect patients??? intention to use HTMS. Several adaptations were applied in the model to be applicable in the HTMS context, such as augmenting the model with HTMS self-efficacy and HTMS anxiety constructs. 4. To measure the different psychological variables in the proposed model, valid and reliable measures from previous studies were used. However the preliminary study was used to develop measures, which did not exist in the literature. 5. These measures were tested in the final study. The subjects were patients who had been affected with Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) and/or Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (COPD). Given the chronic nature of these diseases, the necessity for extended monitoring and management and frequent admission to hospitals due to worsening health status, these patients were deemed the most appropriate candidates for the HTMS. Further studies with more cases need to be conducted to test the actual model in which the impact of HTMS characteristics, psychological and demographic factors associated with technophobia upon intention to use the HTMS and the correlation of these factors with each other in appropriate healthcare settings.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24234</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of workplace air contaminants</field><field name="creator">Bakand, Shahnaz, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Exposure to air contaminants is significantly associated with both short-term and long-term health effects. However, the precise mechanisms that derive such effects are not always understood. While an extensive background database from in vivo toxicological studies have been developed, most toxicity data is from oral and dermal chemical exposures rather than inhalation exposure. There is a need to explore new alternative approaches to provide toxicity information particularly on this technically demanding area. This research explores the potential of in vitro methods for toxicity assessment of workplace air contaminants. A tiered approach for in vitro toxicity testing of workplace contaminants was designed in which appropriate air sampling and exposure techniques were developed. A diversified battery of in vitro assays including the MTS (tetrazolium salt, Promega), NRU (neutral red uptake, Sigma) and ATP (adenosine triphosphate, Promega) and a multiple human cell system including: A549- lung derived cells; HepG2-liver derived cells, and skin fibroblasts were used. Primarily the application and merits of in vitro methods for prediction of toxicity of selected workplace contaminants including Ammonium hydroxide, Cadmium chloride, Cobalt chloride, Formaldehyde, Glutaraldehyde, Manganese chloride, Mercuric chloride, Sodium dichromate, Sulphureous acid and Zinc chloride was confirmed. To study the toxicity of airborne contaminants an indirect exposure method was established using air sampling techniques followed by static and dynamic direct exposure methods by culturing cells on porous membranes to reveal representative data relating to human airborne exposures. The static method enabled the measurement of an airborne IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) value for selected volatile organic compounds (VOCs) including: Xylene (IC50 = 5,350-8,200 ppm) and Toluene (IC50 = 10,500- 16,600 ppm) after 1 hr exposure. By implementing the dynamic method, airborne IC50 values were calculated for gaseous contaminants including: NO2 (IC50 = 11 ?? 3.54 ppm; NRU), SO2 (IC50 = 48 ?? 2.83 ppm; ATP) and NH3 (IC50 = 199 ?? 1.41 ppm; MTS). A higher sensitivity of in vitro methods was observed compared to in vivo published data. A range of in vitro bioassays in conjunction with exposure techniques developed in this thesis may provide an advanced technology for a comprehensive risk assessment of workplace air contaminants.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Toxicity testing - In vitro</field><field name="subject">Chemicals - Safety measures</field><field name="subject">Air - Pollution - Toxicology</field><field name="subject">Occupational exposure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24246</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of exposure to Chaozhou Xianshi music on pre-service teachers??? development as music educators</field><field name="creator">Ng, Chun-Hoi Daniel, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Recent music educational reforms in Hong Kong stress the need to cultivate students??? understanding toward Chinese music. However, research indicates that Hong Kong music teachers lack sufficient confidence and valuing to teach Chinese music. Based on this background, the purpose of this study was to address the need to train teachers with the confidence and skills to teach Chinese music.  An indigenous genre, Chaozhou xianshi music was introduced as a focus of study because the genre is considered to be a useful mediator for teachers and their students to understand and appreciate Chinese music. The study comprised two inter-related parts. Part I included fieldwork in xianshi music, semi-structured interviews with xianshi musicians and literature review that investigated the theory, teaching and learning of xianshi and Chinese music. Based on the findings of Part I, Part II involved a Pilot and Main Study that were designed to trial a pre-service teacher education programme at the Hong Kong Institute of Education that would prepare trainees to undertake the teaching of xianshi and Chinese music. A xianshi music ensemble was formed to expose the trainees to practical experiences of the genre. During their final teaching practice session, the trainees were asked to design and teach xianshi and Chinese music in schools. Qualitative data were collected from interviews and an analysis of video-recordings of their teaching. Findings revealed that a sequenced exposure in xianshi music was advantageous for the trainees to develop their potential and competence to teach Chinese music, as was evident in these trainees??? teaching approaches and implementation.  Findings suggest that Hong Kong music teachers should adopt the techniques proposed in this study. Importantly, music teachers should demonstrate their role as transmitters of musical heritage and be capable to design and implement effective lessons, to involve their students to practical experiences in traditional Chinese music, and to develop their students intellectually and artistically so that they become informed consumers of their own and other musical traditions. In the long run, these approaches may help to increase the valuing of Chinese music and culture among students and citizens in the society more generally.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Folk music -- China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24249</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOBMAS - A methodology for ontology-based multi-agent systems development</field><field name="creator">Tran, Quynh Nhu, Information Systems, Technology &amp; Management, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">???Agent-based systems are one of the most vibrant and important areas of research and development to have emerged in information technology in the 1990s??? (Luck et al. 2003). The use of agents as a metaphor for designing and constructing software systems represents an innovative movement in the field of software engineering: ???Agent- Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE)??? (Lind 2000; Luck et al. 2003). This research contributes to the evolution of AOSE by proposing a comprehensive ontology-based methodology for the analysis and design of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). The methodology is named MOBMAS, which stands for ???Methodology for Ontology-Based MASs???. A major improvement of MOBMAS over the existing agentoriented MAS development methodologies is its explicit and extensive support for ontology-based MAS development. Ontologies have been widely acknowledged for their significant benefits to interoperability, reusability, MAS development activities (such as system analysis and agent knowledge modelling) and MAS operation (such as agent communication and reasoning). Recognising these desirable ontology???s benefits, MOBMAS endeavours to identify and implement the various ways in which ontologies can be used in the MAS development process and integrated into the MAS model definitions. In so doing, MOBMAS has exploited ontologies to enhance its MAS development process and MAS development product with various strengths. These strengths include those ontology???s benefits listed above, and those additional benefits uncovered by MOBMAS, e.g. support for verification and validation, extendibility, maintainability and reliability. Compared to the numerous existing agent-oriented methodologies, MOBMAS is the first that explicitly and extensively investigates the diverse potential advantages of ontologies in MAS development, and which is able to implement these potential advantages via an ontology-based MAS development process and a set of ontology-based MAS model definitions. Another major contribution of MOBMAS to the field of AOSE is its ability to address all key concerns of MAS development in one methodological framework. The methodology provides support for a comprehensive list of methodological requirements,  which are important to agent-oriented analysis and design, but which may not be wellsupported by the current methodologies. These methodological requirements were identified and validated by this research from three sources: the existing agent-oriented methodologies, the existing evaluation frameworks for agent-oriented methodologies and conventional system development methodologies, and a survey of practitioners and researchers in the field of AOSE. MOBMAS supports the identified methodological requirements by combining the strengths of the existing agent-oriented methodologies (i.e. by reusing and enhancing the various strong techniques and model definitions of the existing methodologies where appropriate), and by proposing new techniques and model definitions where necessary. The process of developing MOBMAS consisted of three sequential research activities. The first activity identified and validated a list of methodological requirements for an Agent Oriented Software Engineering methodology as mentioned above. The second research activity developed MOBMAS by specifying a development process, a set of techniques and a set of model definitions for supporting the identified methodological requirements. The final research activity evaluated and refined MOBMAS by collecting expert reviews on the methodology, using the methodology on an application and conducting a feature analysis of the methodology.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Intelligent agents (Computer software)</field><field name="subject">Software engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24254</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Stochastic heat equations with memory in infinite dimensional spaces</field><field name="creator">Xie, Shuguang, School of Mathematics, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis is concerned with stochastic heat equation with memory and nonlinear energy supply. The main motivation to study such systems comes from Thermodynamics, see [85]. The main objective of this work is to study the existence and uniqueness of solutions to such equations and to investigate some fundamental properties of solutions like continuous dependence on initial conditions. In our approach we follow the seminal papers by Da Prato and Clement [10], where the stochastic heat equation with memory is tranformed into an integral equation in a function space and the so-called mild solutions are studied. In the aforementioned papers only linear equations with additive noise were investigated. The main contribution of this work is the extension of this approach to nonlinear equations. Our main tools are the theory of stochastic convolutions as developed in [33] and the theory of resolvent kernels for deterministic linear heat equations with memory, see[10]. Since the solution at time t depends on the whole history of the process up to time t, the resolvent kernel does not define a semigroup of operators in the state space of the process and therefore a ???standard??? theory of stochastic evolution equations as presented in the monograph [33] does not apply. A more delicate analysis of the resolvent kernles and the associated stochastic convolutions is needed. We will describe now content of this thesis in more detail. Introductory Chapters 1 and 2 collect some basic and essentially well known facts about the Wiener process, stochastic integrals, stochastic convolutions and integral kernels. However, some results in Chapter 2 dealing with stochastic convolution with respect to non-homogenous Wiener process are extensions of the existing theory. The main results of this thesis are presented in Chapters 3 and 4. In Chapter 3 we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to heat equations with additive noise and either Lipschitz or dissipative nonlinearities. In both cases we prove the continuous dependence of solutions on initial conditions. In Chapter 4 we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions and continuous dependence on initial conditions for equations with multiplicative noise. The diffusion coefficients defined by unbounded operators are allowed.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Stochastic integral equations</field><field name="subject">Heat equation</field><field name="subject">Dimensional analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24257</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of an enterprise knowledge base (EKB) framework for new product development (NPD) in customer order driven engineering (CODE) environment</field><field name="creator">Sharif, Syed Ahsan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">It is widely believed that with the transition from the industrial to information-based economics, organizational knowledge has emerged as the single most critical resource at both macro and micro levels, which promotes the creation, sharing, and leveraging of the organization???s knowledge in current Customer Order Driven Engineering (CODE) environment. Insufficient knowledge management, hence lack of a structured Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) in a CODE environment, whilst involved in New Product Development (NPD) process may result in several problems resulting in creating less successful products. This research establishes an ???Enterprise Knowledge Base (EKB) framework??? with focus on the Product, Process and Organizational issues related to the NPD process. The framework has three major stages, namely ???Knowledge Acquisition???, ???Knowledge Organizing??? and ???Knowledge Validating???. Various frameworks/methods/models are developed as steps for each of these stages. The framework may increase the effectiveness of product and process development as well as enterprise competitiveness through developing a system architecture to understand, analyse and map organisational, operational activities and business objectives; and increasing the ability of an organisation to establish an integrated partnerships to share efforts on the design, manufacture and delivery of products. In knowledge acquisition stage, a ???Knowledge Capture framework??? and the ???Relationship matrices??? are developed to analyse and link the generic knowledge items of a NPD process in concurrent engineering environment. Among the relationship matrices, Task versus Task (Design Structure Matrix - DSM) matrix is comprehensively explored and decomposed to structure and link several processes at different levels for effective representation of the overall enterprise representation. In knowledge organizing stage, the acquired knowledge (important relations identified in the Task versus Task matrices) is represented in the form of ???Questionnaires???. Best practices gathered from several manufacturing firms in NPD in CODE have also been  used as knowledge resource base for the Questionnaires. For grouping and validation of these Questionnaires, an ???Assessment Model??? is developed, which consists of five performance indicators of the organization namely ???Marketing???, ???Technical???, ???Financial???, ???Resource Management???, and ???Project Management???. Industry applications are carried out in two Australian Manufacturing Companies for the validation of the acquired knowledge. Two tests are carried out; in order to assess the sensitivity of question categories followed by another test to observe whether the model can accurately display the overall performance of the company in the five categories of NPD phases. These two tests have identified possible improvement areas in the NPD process of manufacturing organizations involved in the validation phase. Up to 80% of the findings of the EKB framework and assessment model were found to reflect the actual practices of the organizations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management</field><field name="subject">New products - Management</field><field name="subject">Product management</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24260</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Nation of Sadness? Reading history, culture, and gender in Hou Hsiao-hsien???s A City of Sadness</field><field name="creator">Hung, Christine Yu-Ting, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis engages with Taiwanese history by offering a reading of Hou Hsiaohsien???s A City of Sadness (1989), making reference to the film???s historical dimensions, cultural representations and gender issues in the period 1945 to 1949. In addition, Hou???s cinematography is detailed with comparison to Yasujiro Ozu and the influences of Japanese colonisation. Hou???s immense contribution to Taiwanese film consists principally in a Taiwanese trilogy that traces Taiwan???s history in the 20th century. In The Puppet Master (1993) Hou details the era of Japanese colonisation from 1895 to the restoration of Taiwan by the Kuomintang in 1945. Later, A City of Sadness focuses on the fate of the Lin family from 1945 to 1949, which epitomises people???s life in Taiwan during the initial stages of Kuomintang domination. Finally, Good Men, Good Women (1995) highlights two different eras in Taiwan: the political movement in the 1950s and the pop culture in the 1990s. The thesis uses illustrations from all three films to explore Hou???s historical, cultural and gender representations. In order to understand Hou???s ideology and beliefs in greater depth, I also review his autobiographical film, A Time to Live, and A Time to Die (1985). This thesis examines Taiwan???s indigenous culture and the impact of Japanese and Chinese cultural practices in A City of Sadness through the post-colonial theories of Perry Anderson, Homi Bhabha, and Chris Berry. I draw on their theories of cultural hegemony and my empiricism to investigate Hou???s representation of the political situation in Taiwan. Finally, the thesis evaluates gender issues in A City of Sadness, with reference to Julia Kristeva???s notion of ???feminine time??? and the debate between Emilie Yeh and Mizou concerning ???whether women can really enter history???. In evaluating A City of Sadness I argue that Hou Hsiao-hsien???s use of a family???s microhistory to parallel the national macro-history of the February 28th Incident opens an important historical window through which the audience may re-encounter and reflect on Taiwan???s past, and think positively about its future.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Motion pictures - Taiwan - History</field><field name="subject">Women - Taiwan - History</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - History - 1945-</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - Civilization - Japanese influences</field><field name="subject">Taiwan - Civilization - Chinese influences</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24263</field></doc><doc><field name="title">From the 'New Wave' to the 'Unnameable': post-dramatic theatre &amp; Australia in the 1980s &amp; 1990s</field><field name="creator">Hamilton, Margaret, School of Media, Film &amp; Theatre, UNSW</field><field name="description">The object of this dissertation is to re-assess Australian examples of ???performance??? in light of discourses and directions in dramaturgy that have emerged since the 1970s internationally. The thesis applies Hans-Thies Lehmann???s comprehensive theory of post-dramatic theatre to explicate examples of departures from dramatic theatre in view of the expansive field of inquiry implied by the description ???performance??? or ???new media arts??? and general cultural-political theory. To examine the de-centralisation of text specific to post-dramatic theatre the dissertation analyses firstly, material devised collaboratively at all stages of creative development in its case studies of the Sydney based companies The Sydney Front (1986-1993) and Open City (1987 -); and secondly, Heiner M??ller???s concept of ???literature??? written for the theatre and in opposition to its convention. In addition, the analysis of M??ller serves as an introduction to a comparative analysis of a dramatic (literary) theatre project by a group of Aboriginal artists based on a post-dramatic text by M??ller. This dissertation endeavours to contribute to documentation on post-dramatic theatre in Australia and more broadly, to conceptions of contemporary forms of dramaturgy. More specifically, the thesis argues that dramaturgy no longer necessarily concerns the identification of an aesthetic locus that explicitly explicates the audience???s relation to a known macrocosm. Instead, the thesis conceives of dramaturgy as a compositional strategy that can be thought of within the bounds of Aristotle???s perfunctory visual dimension ???opsis??? and elaborated upon in terms of Kristeva???s theory of the ???thetic??? as regulating ???semiotic??? incursions into the ???symbolic??? order. In doing so, the thesis proposes the concept of a ???televisual??? and an ???abject??? dramaturgy, the latter on the basis of a relation to the older tradition of carnival and identifies a link between intertextuality (transposition) and dramaturgical strategies that engage the spectator in the theatre situation and the dissolution of logocentric hierarchy.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Experimental theater</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24266</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Corporate governance in China</field><field name="creator">Tan, Michael N T, School of Modern Language Studies, UNSW</field><field name="description">Since the late nineteen nineties, corporate governance has been recognised by the Chinese leadership as being an integral and vital part of economic reform. At the macro level the reform is to transition to a market economy and at the micro level, business enterprises are adopting sound standards of corporate governance. This thesis analyses the various models: the shareholder value, the stakeholder, the stewardship and the convergence models of corporate governance. It looks at the Chinese scenario - what model of governance has China adopted and is it appropriate? What problems of corporate governance are special to China and how are these problems being resolved? Many of the problems are due to the fact that China has adopted the shareholder value model ??? a model based on the UK / USA. However, unlike them, China does not posses the requisite institutions necessary to underpin the efficient functioning of the model. The Chinese capital markets are nascent and not well regulated, the rule of law is tentative and the regulatory bodies are lacking in enforcement powers. In an effort to encourage good corporate governance, the China Securities Regulatory Commission promulgated the QFII (Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor) scheme in December 2002 in the hope that by opening the domestic securities market to foreign financial institutions, this would result in the implementation of sound corporate governance in Chinese listed companies as they vied to attract foreign shareholders. A survey was carried out and the results have only been mildly encouraging. The QFII has not had the dramatic impact that was expected of it initially and the reason is that the quotas allocated have been small and the QFII have had many restrictions placed. Until these are loosened the impact of the QFII will continue to be modest.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Corporate governance - China</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24269</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Selective disassembly for re-use of industrial products</field><field name="creator">Pornprasitpol, Pornwan, Mechanical &amp; Manufacturing Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">As a result of rapid product development, the product life cycle has become shorter, and thus the amount of waste from discarded industrial products has risen dramatically. An awareness of the world???s environmental problems has stimulated researchers to explore the opportunities to reuse, recycle and remanufacture end-of-life products. Disassembly is a systematic approach to separating products into components or subassemblies in order to facilitate recovery of components or materials. However, the full disassembly of a product tends to be unproductive due to technical and cost constraints and product conditions after usage. Therefore, selective disassembly has been introduced as a more practical approach, where only a limited number of disassembly paths that lead to selected parts with recovering potential are considered. This research focuses on the development of a selective disassembly methodology by reversing an assembly sequencing approach. The methodology uses a step-by-step approach to generate a disassembly sequence diagram. This involves listing all the parts within the product, generating a liaison diagram to illustrate part relationships and then establishing precedence rules describing prerequisite actions for each liaison. This is followed by segregating disassembly paths that lead to the removal of selected parts or subassemblies. Then a winnowing process is applied to these paths to eliminate invalid disassembly states and transitions. The last step is to select the optimal disassembly path by using the time requirement as the main selection criterion. In order to shorten the time for carrying out the sequencing process, a javabased program that is capable of performing the first three steps has been created. The program requires three basic inputs in forms of precedence rules, and user-required part (s) and disassembly rules, prescribing which liaison (s) should be done subsequent to a particular liaison. The viability of the methodology and the program is proved through seven case studies conducted on a fishing reel, a single-hole punch, a kettle, an entire washing machine and three washing machine subassemblies. The application of the program allows the users to determine an optimal disassembly sequence in a very short time and with only basic product information as the input.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Recycling (Waste, etc.)</field><field name="subject">Production engineering - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Industrial management - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Product life cycle - Environmental aspects</field><field name="subject">Environmental protection - Economic aspects</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24274</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Tests of the Solow efficiency wage model using Australian aggregate industry and macro economic time series data</field><field name="creator">Chand, Jatin, Economics, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis assesses the efficiency wage hypothesis using Australian industry and macro economic time series data by focussing on two questions: whether paying an above market clearing wage called the efficiency wage raises industry output and productivity, and if such a payment causes unemployment at the macro economic level. The wageproductivity or wage-output nexus is investigated using three techniques; namely a decomposition procedure used by Huang, Halam, Orazem, and Paterno (1998), an instrumental variable estimation method, and the Solow residuals approach. Further, an examination of macro economic unemployment involves developing an aggregate unemployment equation, where the Solow (1979) model is used to derive a testable hypothesis. The Solow model argues that effort, which is a function of the wage, enters the production function when the real wage is rigid. By introducing profit maximising behaviour and making further economic assumptions, the Solow condition that the effort elasticity with respect to the wage is one can be derived. The theoretical framework of Solow is useful as specifying a production function allows the possibility of aggregate data being used to assess the wage-productivity prediction. The Solow condition is also useful because it provides the basis for constructing a testable hypothesis using an unemployment equation. Solow???s theoretical framework and the Solow condition does not rely on the economic assumptions of the shirking, labour turnover, sociological and adverse selection [micro economic] efficiency wage models. Therefore, the innovation of this thesis is to treat the efficiency wage hypothesis as an imperfectly competitive model of the labour market using applied macro economic methods. Previous Australian macro economic literature in the 1970s and 1980s have argued that the wage is either harmful to employment prospects (ie unemployment is classical), or that factors such as consumption and investment are more important (ie unemployment is Keynesian). One of the aims of the thesis is to use the empirical analysis to suggest that neither of these propositions is entirely correct. Rather, an intermediate position is arrived at by arguing that there is some empirical evidence in Australian industry and macro economic time series data to suggest that the wage plays a dual function: both as a small source of productivity and also a minor cause of involuntary unemployment.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wages - Australia</field><field name="subject">Productivity</field><field name="subject">Unemployment</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24289</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implantable surgical devices issues of product liability</field><field name="creator">Higgs, Robin JED, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Patients who have undergone treatment that has included the surgical implantation of a prosthetic device can become dissatisfied for many reasons. One cause for dissatisfaction is any adverse event where there is a demonstrable causal nexus with the failure of a device that is defective or at risk of being so. The magnitude of therapeutic product failure is considerable and therapeutic goods such as Vioxx, Thalidomide, silicon-gel-filled breast implants, contaminated blood products, cardiac pacemakers and valves, and orthopaedic devices are testimony to this. Many of these events have exposed a greyish area of Australian law that balances medical negligence with consumer protection and contract law. Australian product liability legislation that regulates the use of therapeutic goods is a complex amalgam of law that has at its foundations the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) and the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth). When a surgical device fails there can be exposure to liability. This thesis explores those important issues that can impact on individuals or on organisations and it is evident that where issues of product liability concern implanted surgical devices the current regulations for consumer protection may not always be the most appropriate. It is evident that there is a culture of under-reporting of adverse events to a Therapeutic Good Administration that does not have the resources to investigate the cause for failure of a surgical device. Furthermore, there is a potential for bias and conflict of interest in an environment where the regulator depends on the regulated for the funding of its existence. Other issues include the complex and often undesirable consequences of those partnerships that can evolve with the development of an implantable device and with the undertaking of clinical trials, the role of the learned intermediary, that interface between manufacturer and consumer, and the role of the expert witness, that interface between justice and injustice. These and other matters that can significantly influence any debate of implantable surgical device product liability are explored and recommendations are made that might form the basis of a Therapeutic Goods (Safe Medical Devices) Amendment Act.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Surgical instruments and apparatus</field><field name="subject">Implants, Artificial</field><field name="subject">Contract -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Consumer protection -- Law and legislation -- Australia.</field><field name="subject">Product liability -- Australia.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24292</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The ecology of chemical defence in a filamentous marine red alga</field><field name="creator">Paul, Nicholas Andrew, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">I investigated the ecological functions of halogenated secondary metabolites from the red alga Asparagopsis armata, their localisation in specialised cells and also their cost of production. A. armata produces large amounts of halogenated metabolites ( &amp;lt 20 ??g / mg dry weight) that are sequestered in gland cells, as was demonstrated with light, epifluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Cellular structures were identified that likely assist the release of metabolites from the gland cells to the algal surface. The halogenated metabolites of A. armata have multiple ecological roles, functioning as both inhibitors of bacterial fouling and as herbivore deterrents. Their activity against bacteria and herbivores was measured by a novel test in which the metabolites were manipulated in A. armata by omitting bromide ions from the culture media. This technique prevented the production of halogenated metabolites, but did not impact on other aspects of algal biology. Algae lacking halogenated metabolites (bromide [-] algae) had higher densities of epiphytic bacteria than those that continued to produce metabolites (bromide [+] algae). Bioassays with pure compounds against individual bacterial isolates further supported an inhibitory role for the halogenated metabolites against epiphytic bacteria, and also indicated an affect on bacterial community structure as well as abundance. Bromide (+) A. armata produced halogenated metabolites that also deterred feeding by two herbivores (an amphipod and an abalone), but not a third (an opisthobranch mollusc). A novel outcome from these feeding assays was the demonstration of a relationship between herbivore size and consumption of the chemically defended A. armata by the abalone Haliotis rubra. In addition to the fitness benefits gained from chemical defence, there were also costs for allocating resources to secondary metabolites. These costs were only detected under limiting light resources, consistent with predictions of the plant defence models. The integration of chemical analyses and cellular measures of chemical defence proved essential in elucidating resource allocation to chemical defence in the filamentous stage of A. armata. This thesis highlights that the simple relationships between growth and defence in filamentous algae can provide an excellent model for studies of the ecology and evolution of chemical defences in marine algae.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Marine chemical ecology</field><field name="subject">Marine metabolites</field><field name="subject">Marine algae</field><field name="subject">Red algae</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24304</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Structure and role of rhizomorphs of Armillaria luteobubalina</field><field name="creator">Pareek, Mamta, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Two different types of rhizomorphs were produced by A. luteobubalina in vitro conditions - aerial and submerged. They differed in growth rate, amount of mucilage, extent of peripheral hyphae, degree of pigmentation and in the structure of inner cortex. Otherwise they had a similar internal structure comprising 4 radial zones, namely, peripheral hyphae, outer cortex, inner cortex and medulla. Two membrane permeant symplastic fluorescent tracers, carboxy-DFFDA and CMAC which ultimately sequestered in vacuoles, behaved in a similar fashion in aerial and submerged rhizomorphs regardless of whether pigment was present in the outer cortical cell walls or in the extracellular material. Rhizomorphs appeared to be mostly impermeable to these probes with exception of a few fluorescent patches that potentially connected peripheral hyphae to inner cortical cells. In contrast, the apoplastic tracer HPTS which was applied to fresh material and its localisation determined in semi-thin (dry) sections following anhydrous freeze substitution appeared to be impeded by the pigmentation in cell walls and/or the extracellular material in the outer cortical zone. Structures identified as air pores arose directly from the mycelium and grew upwards into the air. A cluster of rhizomorph apices is initiated immediately beneath the air pores. As air pores elongated they differentiated into a cylindrical structure. Mature air pores became pigmented as did also the surface mycelium of the colony. The pigmented surface layer extended into the base of air pores, where it was elevated into a mound by tissue inside the base of the air pore. Beneath the pigmented surface layer there was a region of loose hyphae with extensive gas space between them. This gas space extended into the base of the air pore and was continuous with the central gas canal of rhizomorphs. Oxygen is conducted through the air pores and their associated rhizomorph gas canals into the oxygen electrode chamber with a conductivity averaging 679??68x10-12 m3s-1. The time averaged oxygen concentration data from the oxygen electrode chamber were used to compare three different air pore diffusion models. It was found that the widely used pseudo-steady-state model overestimated the oxygen conductivity. Finally, a model developed on the basis of fundamental transport equations was used to calculate oxygen diffusivities. This model gave a better comparison with the experimental data.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rhizomorph</field><field name="subject">armillaria</field><field name="subject">oxygen diffusivity</field><field name="subject">airpore</field><field name="subject">permeability</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24353</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Implementation patterns for supporting learning and group interactions</field><field name="creator">Kutay, Cat, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis covers research on group learning by using a computer as the medium. The computer software provides the basic blending of the students??? contributions augmented by the effects generated for the specific learning domain by a system of agents to guide the process of the students??? learning. The research is based on the approach that the computer as a medium is not an end point of the interaction. The development of agents in based on Human- Computer-Human interaction or HCH. HCH is about removing the idea that the role of the computer is that of an intelligent agent and reducing its role to that of a mixer, with the ability to insert adaptive electronic (software) components that add extra effects and depth to the product of the human-human interactions. For the computer to achieve this support, it must be able to analyse the input from the individuals and the group as a whole. Experiments have been conducted on groups working face to face, and then on groups using software developed for the research. Patterns of interaction and learning have been extracted from the logs and files of these group sessions. Also a pattern language has been developed by which to describe these patterns, so that the agent support needed to analyse and respond appropriately to each pattern can be developed. The research has led to the derivation of a structure that encompasses all the types of support required, and provides the format for implementing each type of support. The main difficulty in this work is the limited ability of computers to analyse human thoughts through their actions. However progress is made in analysing the level of approach by students to a range of learning concepts. The research identified the separate patterns that contribute to learning agents development and form a language of learning processes, and the agents derived from these patterns could in future be linked into a multi-agent system to support learning.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer science</field><field name="subject">Learning</field><field name="subject">Human-computer interaction</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24356</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Proposals for the reform of the taxation of goodwill in Australia</field><field name="creator">Walpole, Michael, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis analyses the Australian approach to taxation of goodwill and related intangibles.  It asks the questions: 'Is the current Australian approach to taxation of goodwill coherent?'; and 'Could a different approach minimise any distortions?' The thesis identifies the increasing importance of goodwill and other intangible property in a modern information-based economy.  It identifies benchmarks for a 'good' tax system ??? such as efficiency, simplicity, and equity.  It emphasises the criteria of simplicity and efficiency but includes other criteria and specifically considers the issue of alignment of accounting and legal concepts.  It concludes that the current misalignment makes it difficult for the tax system to deal with goodwill coherently. The thesis criticises the treatment of goodwill under various Australian taxes, including stamp duty; Goods and Services Tax; taxation of capital gains; and income tax.  It specifically considers the treatment of intangible sources of goodwill and their relationship with goodwill itself.  The discussion of income tax pays particular attention to the role of goodwill and other intangibles in international transfer pricing.  The thesis draws conclusions about the treatment of goodwill in Australia and whether the Australian approach meets the benchmarks established at the outset.  The thesis demonstrates that the current Australian approach leads, inter alia, to tax avoidance.  The current approach also offends a number of other criteria of a 'good' system.  The thesis considers the UK tax treatment of intangibles held by resident companies and considers this model for Australia.  It also considers the abandoned 'Tax Value Method' previously proposed for Australia.  From this and other material, it suggests possible new directions and an alternative approach to taxing goodwill in Australia.  These include a consistent and coherent definition of goodwill for tax that is compatible with law and accounting.  The thesis also urges the development of a consistent approach to taxing goodwill at both the state and federal levels; and suggests greater reliance on the existence of goodwill as a means to establish jurisdiction to impose tax in international tax situations.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">goodwill</field><field name="subject">income tax</field><field name="subject">capital gains tax</field><field name="subject">GST</field><field name="subject">permanent establishment</field><field name="subject">duty</field><field name="subject">stamp duty</field><field name="subject">intangibles</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24362</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Political liberalism and political change</field><field name="creator">Field, Sandra Leonie, Philosophy, UNSW</field><field name="description">Michel Foucault???s and John Rawls??? respective contributions to political philosophy appear to have little in common.  Foucault gives an insistently descriptive account of the reality of the political domain; Rawls focusses on normative questions of how it ideally might be.  To the extent that the two thinkers are juxtaposed, such juxtaposition is generally used to highlight their differences.  Foucault???s arguments are characteristically taken to show Rawls??? preoccupation with consensus and legitimacy to be politically problematic. This thesis pursues the suspicion that there is more positive ground for comparison between Rawls and Foucault than this prima facie assessment would allow.  I claim that there are substantive and deep-seated congruences between Rawlsian and Foucaultian conceptual apparatuses.  However, to vindicate this claim I take an indirect route.  I start within the debates around Rawls??? later work.  In this way I motivate a certain reading of this work which is justified in its own right, rather than being justified by the desire to force Rawls into Foucaultian categories.  Having established this reading of Rawls with reference to immanent Rawlsian criteria, I develop the striking parallels which obtain between Rawls??? and Foucault???s historical conceptions of political normativity.  In light of this commonality, it becomes possible to understand their respective practice as intellectuals in terms of a shared strategy to privilege democracy over truth.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Liberalism</field><field name="subject">Political science</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24365</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The logos of land: economic and proprietarian conceptions of statutory access rights</field><field name="creator">Grattan, Donald Scott, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">Legislation in various jurisdictions alters the common law right to control access to one???s land by allowing the imposition of rights of access in favour of one landowner over the land of another.  The relevant legislation can be divided into two categories.  The first-generation legislation (s 88K, Conveyancing Act 1919 (NSW) and s 180, Property Law Act 1974 (Qld)) permits the creation of easements over servient land to facilitate the development of dominant land.  The second-generation legislation (the Access to Neighbouring Land Act of New South Wales, Tasmania and the United Kingdom) permits the creation of temporary rights of access over servient land to facilitate work on dominant land.  This thesis examines the extent to which this change in the law can be justified by three modes of ethical discourse: right-based, duty-based, and goal-based reasoning.  An examination of the first-generation legislation and the cases in which it has been applied suggests that a form of goal-based reasoning can be used to justify its enactment.  The legislation is needed to facilitate the efficient use of land where the existence of a bilateral monopoly and the possibility of strategic bargaining puts at risk the conclusion of a mutually beneficial agreement regarding access.  A review of the second-generation legislation and the law reform reports and parliamentary debate that preceded its enactment indicates that the legislation can be justified by a form of duty-based reasoning.  The legislation is needed to bring about a proper social ordering by imposing access rights where this would be consistent with the ideal of good neighbourliness.  The thesis concludes that although these goal-based and duty-based discourses make an arguable case for the enactment of both generations of the legislation, neither of them, in an unadulterated form, provides a conclusive justification.  Rather, an eclectic approach that draws on both discourses is required.  It proposes that the legislation???s compensation provisions be amended to reflect the commingling of the ideas of efficiency, a properly ordered society and intensive land use, and to allow the servient owner to share in the benefits generated by the imposition of access.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Land tenure -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Land use -- Law and legislation</field><field name="subject">Right of property</field><field name="subject">Law -- Philosophy</field><field name="subject">Law -- Interpretation and construction</field><field name="subject">Law -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Jurisprudence</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24368</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Market orientation and Guanxi in Chinese business enterprises - substitutes or complements?</field><field name="creator">Chen, Shu, Marketing, Australian School of Business, UNSW</field><field name="description">Do western management practices and beliefs and Chinese business practices complement or substitute each other in the emerging world of Chinese business? This thesis explores the interaction between two central ideas in western and Chinese thinking about the way business should be done ??? between the western emphasis on market orientation as the key to profitable growth, and the Chinese reliance on traditional networks embodied in the concept of guanxi. These two variables are embedded in a broader model of strategic decision making in order to identify moderating factors that may influence performance outcomes. Following pretests and in-depth interviews, in 2003 a sample of 152 businesses was drawn in Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang area from two industries, the electronics industry and the textile/garment industry. Low response rates and a small sample were two important limiting factors. Two broad analytical approaches were used. The first made use of graphical smoothing methodology, an approach that facilitates the identification of complex non-linear interactions among the variables. The second used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) where a linear structure is imposed on the relationships among the variables, allowing simultaneous consideration of the full variable set together with an analysis of fit and measurement error, while the graphical smoothing non-linear method was effectively limited to three variables at a time. The graphical analysis suggested the existence of nonlinearities in many relationships, and found a positive interaction between guanxi and market orientation in influencing performance, and that both were in that sense complements rather than substitutes. The SEM analysis suggested that while there were some indirect links between guanxi, market orientation and performance, these were relatively weak, (although the use of guanxi with other managers was a factor in market orientation), and that the primary driver of performance was the strength of the competitive advantage possessed by the firm. This factor directly impacted market orientation, indirectly affected guanxi and accounted for much of the observed correlation between the two cultural variables, guanxi and market orientation, and performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">No bibliographic record is available on LRD.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24315</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Evaluation of salinisation processes in the Spicers Creek catchment, central west region of New South Wales, Australia.</field><field name="creator">Morgan, Karina, School of Biological, Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences, UNSW</field><field name="description">Spicers Creek catchment is located approximately 400 km west of Sydney in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia. Dryland salinity has been recognised as a major environmental issue impacting soil and water resources in the Central West region of NSW for over 70 years. Due to the geological complexity of the catchment and the presence of high salt loads contained within the soils, groundwater and surface waters, the Spicers Creek catchment was identified as a large contributor of salinity to the Macquarie River catchment. Over fifty-two dryland salinity occurrences have been identified in the Spicers Creek catchment and it appears that dryland salinity is controlled by the presence of geological structures and permeability contrasts in the shallow aquifer system. Combinations of climatic, geological and agricultural factors are escalating salinity problems in the catchment. The main aim of this thesis was to identify the factors affecting salinisation processes in the Spicers Creek catchment. These include the role of geological structures, the source(s) of salts to the groundwater system and the geochemical processes influencing seepage zone development. To achieve these aims a multidisciplinary approach was untaken to understand the soils, geology, hydrogeology and hydrogeochemistry of the catchment. Investigative techniques employed in this project include the use of geophysics, soil chemistry, soil spectroscopy, hydrogeochemistry and environmental isotopes. Evaluation of high-resolution airborne magnetics data showed a major north-east to south-west trending shear zone. This structure dissects the catchment and several other minor faults were observed to be splays off this major structure. These structures were found to be conducive to groundwater flow and are influencing the groundwater chemistry in the fractured aquifer system. Two distinctive groundwater chemical types were identified in the catchment; the saline Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters associated with the fractured Oakdale Formation and the Na-HCO3-rich groundwaters associated with the intermediate groundwater system. The groundwater chemistry of other deep groundwaters in the catchment appears to be due to mixing between these end-member groundwaters within the fractured bedrock system.  The spatial distribution of electrical conductivity, Cl-, Sr2+ and 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios showed the correlation between saline groundwaters and the location of faults. Elevated salinities were associated with the location of two crosscutting fault zones. The spatial distribution of HCO3-, K+, Li+ and ?????3CDIC highlighted the extent of Na-HCO3-rich groundwaters in the catchment and showed that these groundwaters are mixing further east than previously envisaged. These findings show that Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters are geochemically distinctive and have evolved due to extensive water-rock interaction processes within the fracture zones of the Oakdale Formation. These saline groundwaters contain elevated concentrations of trace elements such as As, V and Se, which pose a potential risk for water resources in the area. 87Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios indicated that the source of salinity to the Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters was not purely from marine or aerosol input. Salt is most likely contributed from various allochthonous and autochthonous sources. This research found that the main mechanism controlling the formation of dryland salinity seepage zones in the Spicers Creek catchment is due to the presence of geological structures. These groundwater seepage zones act as mixing zones for rainfall recharge and deeper groundwaters. The main sources of salt to the seepage zones are from deeper Na(Mg)-Cl-rich groundwaters and rainfall accession. The major importance of this research highlights the need for an integrated approach for the use of various geoscientific techniques in dryland salinity research within geologically complex environments.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">salinity</field><field name="subject">New South Wales</field><field name="subject">Spicers Creek Catchment</field><field name="subject">soil salinization</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24327</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Insider trading law in China: regulations of insider trading in China and proposals for reform</field><field name="creator">Huang, Hui, Law, Faculty of Law, UNSW</field><field name="description">The purposes of this thesis are threefold: (1) to investigate the incidence of insider trading in China; (2) to critically examine the regulation of insider trading in China within the Chinese context; and (3) to set out reform proposals. At present, insider trading is a very serious issue in China as it presents a major obstacle to the development of China???s securities market. This thesis is therefore of both theoretical and practical significance. Based on both theoretical arguments and empirical findings, this thesis investigates the extent of insider trading in China, explains why insider trading occurs in China, and examines the harmful and allegedly beneficial effects of insider trading. Insider trading is found to be widespread and widely considered to be harmful in China. This accounts for the fact that China has shown a great willingness to follow the international trend to regulate insider trading. Indeed, with the benefit of overseas experience, China has made a remarkable achievement in establishing its insider trading regulatory regime within a relatively short period of time. Despite this, there are a number of major problems with this regulatory regime, mainly due to the adoption of foreign ideas without due criticism. This is illustrated by various loopholes found in the definition of what is an ???insider???, which are related to confusion over underlying theories of insider trading liability. The thesis conducts an indepth analysis of these theories on a comparative law basis, recommending that the equality of access theory and the Australian ???information connection??? only approach are better suited to China. The thesis also examines other basic elements of insider trading, including the concept of materiality, the issue of when information becomes public, and the subjective elements of insider trading. Furthermore, a detailed discussion is carried out concerning the issue of private civil liability for insider trading. It is submitted that the combination of the nondisclosure-period-traders approach and well-designed damage caps can best ensure that private actions serve as a necessary and appropriate force in the enforcement of insider trading law.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">insider trading in securities</field><field name="subject">law and legislation</field><field name="subject">China.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24333</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Performance differences between normal and low arched feet in 9 - 12 year old children</field><field name="creator">Twomey, Dara, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the past people were excluded from military service and many children suffered under the stigma of having flat feet. Flat feet have been a very popular area of research for years, yet many unresolved issues still exist. There appears to be no universally accepted definition of normal arch height within the general population, which leads to difficulty in identifying and classifying flat feet. A reduced arch appears to have an effect on human movement but the extent of this in dynamic movement remains undefined. The primary aim of this project was to investigate if there were differences in performance of basic gross motor skills between normal and low arched feet in 9 ??? 12 year old children. The principal measurement technique proposed was more accurate than previous studies and permitted an in-depth analysis of the foot in dynamic situations. This three-dimensional foot analysis facilitated a greater understanding of the biomechanics of the foot. The research was undertaken in three phases. The initial phase classified approximately one hundred children???s feet for inclusion in the subsequent phases. Static footprints and dynamic arch height measurement were recorded. The second phase comprised of three-dimensional foot analysis, and basic functional tasks including, jumping, balancing, and hopping undertaken with thirty children; fifteen low and fifteen normal arched. An additional twenty-four children participated in the third and final phase, which included a lower limb gait analysis with strength and proprioception tests in addition to the tests in phase two. Kinematically the low arched foot had a significantly lower medial arch angle and a reduced forefoot pronation angle throughout the gait cycle. This research also found that they had a more externally rotated hip particularly during the stance phase of gait. Functionally there were remarkably few differences between the two groups. The low arched group had significantly reduced performance in lateral hopping. However they showed stronger plantar flexion strength, and performed better in the vertical jumping task. It can be concluded from this research that there is no major disadvantage to performance of gross motor skills for the children in this project with low arched asymptomatic feet.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">flatfoot.</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24344</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Investigating the mechanism of action of the chemotherapeutic agent, cisplatin: drug-DNA interactions in reconstituted chromatin and human gene expression profiling</field><field name="creator">Galea, Anne Marie, Biotechnology &amp; Biomolecular Sciences, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">The DNA-damaging compound, cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloridoplatinum (II)), is a highly successful anti-tumour agent widely used in the treatment of a range of human cancers. Despite the clinical efficacy of cisplatin, its curative potential is largely restricted by the occurrence of drug resistance and several dose-limiting toxic side effects. Attempts to ameliorate these deficiencies have met with limited success. However, it is ultimately hoped that such efforts will benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism by which cisplatin elicits tumourspecific cytotoxicity. The overall aim of this project was to further elucidate the mechanism of action of cisplatin. For this purpose, different experimental approaches were employed to examine the interaction of cisplatin with DNA, and the drug???s effect on human gene expression. Firstly, chromatin structures native to DNA in human cells were simulated in vitro via reconstitution techniques. Their effect on cisplatin-mediated DNA damage could then be evaluated. Various cisplatin analogues and other DNA-damaging compounds were also investigated in this model system. Secondly, the transcriptional response of human cells to cisplatin treatment was analysed using microarrays and gene expression profiling techniques. Transcript profiles compiled for cisplatin and its clinically ineffective isomer, transplatin, were compared to establish a possible relationship between compound-specific responses and therapeutic efficiency. To assess the relative influence of individual chromatin elements on cisplatin- DNA interactions, the first part of this study employed the octamer transfer method of nucleosome reconstitution to create a defined experimental construct. Standard footprinting techniques allowed the precise location of two positioned nucleosomes to be established with respect to the DNA sequence. The construct was then subjected to drug treatment and the resulting DNA damage was quantitatively analysed using a Taq DNA polymerase stop assay. At sites of damage, densitometric comparisons between purified and reconstituted DNA were used to evaluate the influence of nucleosomal core proteins on specific drug-DNA interactions. For cisplatin and most of the other DNAdamaging agents studied, this method revealed regions of the construct that were relatively protected from drug-induced damage. These regions corresponded to the sites  of the positioned nucleosome cores and indicated that the preferred site of DNA binding for these compounds was in the linker region of the construct. Statistical analyses confirmed the significant level of damage protection conferred by the nucleosome cores and exposed subtle differences between the agents examined. Most prominent among the trends observed, was the negative correlation between compound size and the relative propensity for damaging nucleosomal core DNA. Larger compounds generally displayed a greater tendency to target the linker region of the nucleosomal DNA. In contrast, the access of smaller molecules was not impeded as significantly. In the second stage of the project, the effect of cisplatin on human gene expression levels was described using 19000-gene microarrays and transcription profiling methods. In cultured human cells, cisplatin treatment was shown to significantly up- and down-regulate consistent subsets of genes. Many of these genes responded similarly to treatment with transplatin, the therapeutically inactive isomer of cisplatin. However, a smaller proportion of these transcripts underwent differential expression changes in response to the two isomers. Some of these genes may constitute part of the DNA damage response induced by cisplatin that is critical for its anti-tumour activity. Ultimately, the identification of gene expression responses unique to clinically active compounds, like cisplatin, could thus greatly benefit the design and development of improved chemotherapeutics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cisplatin</field><field name="subject">Human genetics</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24928</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Automating the aetiological classification of descriptive injury data</field><field name="creator">Shepherd, Gareth William, Safety Science, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">Injury now surpasses disease as the leading global cause of premature death and disability, claiming over 5.8 millions lives each year. However, unlike disease, which has been subjected to a rigorous epidemiologic approach, the field of injury prevention and control has been a relative newcomer to scientific investigation. With the distribution of injury now well described (i.e. ???who???, ???what???, ???where??? and ???when???), the underlying hypothesis is that progress in understanding ???how??? and ???why??? lies in classifying injury occurrences aetiologically. The advancement of a means of classifying injury aetiology has so far been inhibited by two related limitations: 1. Structural limitation: The absence of a cohesive and validated aetiological taxonomy for injury, and; 2. Methodological limitation: The need to manually classify large numbers of injury cases to determine aetiological patterns. This work is directed at overcoming these impediments to injury research. An aetiological taxonomy for injury was developed consistent with epidemiologic principles, along with clear conventions and a defined three-tier hierarchical structure. Validation testing revealed that the taxonomy could be applied with a high degree of accuracy (coder/gold standard agreement was 92.5-95.0%), and with high inter- and intra- coder reliability (93.0-96.3% and 93.5-96.3%). Practical application demonstrated the emergence of strong aetiological patterns which provided insight into causative sequences leading to injury, and led to the identification of effective control measures to reduce injury frequency and severity. However, limitations related to the inefficient and error-prone manual classification process (i.e. average 4.75 minute/case processing time and 5.0-7.5% error rate), revealed the need for an automated approach. To overcome these limitations, a knowledge acquisition (KA) software tool was developed, tested and applied, based on an expertsystems technique known as ripple down rules (RDR). It was found that the KA system was able acquire tacit knowledge from a human expert and apply learned rules to efficiently and accurately classify large numbers of injury cases. Ultimately, coding error rates dropped to 3.1%, which, along with an average 2.50 minute processing time, compared favourably with results from manual classification. As such, the developed taxonomy and KA tool offer significant advantages to injury researchers who have a need to deduce useful patterns from injury data and test hypotheses regarding causation and prevention.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Wounds and injuries - Epidemiology</field><field name="subject">Diseases - Causes and theories of causation</field><field name="subject">Epidemiology - Statistical methods</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24934</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Application of supervised and unsupervised learning to analysis of the arterial pressure pulse</field><field name="creator">Walsh, Andrew Michael, Graduate school of biomedical engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">This thesis presents an investigation of statistical analytical methods applied to the analysis of the shape of the arterial pressure waveform. The arterial pulse is analysed by a selection of both supervised and unsupervised methods of learning. Supervised learning methods are generally better known as regression. Unsupervised learning methods seek patterns in data without the specification of a target variable. The theoretical relationship between arterial pressure and wave shape is first investigated by study of a transmission line model of the arterial tree. A meta-database of pulse waveforms obtained by the SphygmoCor"??" device is then analysed by the unsupervised learning technique of Self Organising Maps (SOM). The map patterns indicate that the observed arterial pressures affect the wave shape in a similar way as predicted by the theoretical model. A database of continuous arterial pressure obtained by catheter line during sleep is used to derive supervised models that enable estimation of arterial pressures, based on the measured wave shapes. Independent component analysis (ICA) is also used in a supervised learning methodology to show the theoretical plausibility of separating the pressure signals from unwanted noise components. The accuracy and repeatability of the SphygmoCor?? device is measured and discussed. Alternative regression models are introduced that improve on the existing models in the estimation of central cardiovascular parameters from peripheral arterial wave shapes. Results of this investigation show that from the information in the wave shape, it is possible, in theory, to estimate the continuous underlying pressures within the artery to a degree of accuracy acceptable to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. This could facilitate a new role for non-invasive sphygmographic devices, to be used not only for feature estimation but as alternatives to invasive arterial pressure sensors in the measurement of continuous blood pressure.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">self organising maps</field><field name="subject">SOM</field><field name="subject">blood pressure</field><field name="subject">supervised learning</field><field name="subject">independent component analysis</field><field name="subject">sphygmocor</field><field name="subject">arterial pressure</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24841</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The influence of environmental factors on gastric cancer in the Northwest of Iran</field><field name="creator">Pourfarzi, Farhad, Public Health &amp; Community Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW</field><field name="description">Background: Despite a declining trend in the incidence of gastric cancer (GC), it is still a major global public health concern of the 21st century. It afflicts one million people and kills 750,000 annually. It is believed that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the gastric carcinogenesis. However geographic variation and immigrant studies highlight the role of environmental factors. Objective: To evaluate the association of GC with the environmental factors of diet, helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, lifestyle and occupation as well as family history in Iran. Methodology: A population based case-control study was conducted in the Northwest of Iran where one of the highest incidence rates of the world has been reported. Two hundred and seventeen cases of GC and 394 age and gender matched controls were recruited. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire which elicited information on demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, family and medical history, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol drinking and substance abuse) and occupation. Ten milliliters of each subject???s blood was collected for blood grouping and to investigate presence of IgG antibodies against H. pylori using an ELISA kit which had been locally validated for this study. Results: Diet and H. pylori infection were found to be the most important determinants of GC in this study. High intake of allium vegetables and fruit, especially citrus fruit, appears to play a protective role. In addition to the consumption of fruit and vegetables, consumption of fresh fish was also inversely associated with GC. On the other, hand consumption of red meat and dairy products were positively associated with the risk of GC. Other dietary practices were also found to be important factors in the etiology of GC. People who had a preference for higher salt intake and drinking strong and hot tea were at higher risk. Finally, H. pylori infection was found to increase the risk of GC. Conclusion: This study has provided important and original information about the etiology of gastric cancer particularly in the Iranian context. These findings could be used in planning preventive strategies for this malignancy, which is a major health problem in Iran.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gastric cancer</field><field name="subject">case control</field><field name="subject">Helicobacter pylori</field><field name="subject">ELISA</field><field name="subject">occupation</field><field name="subject">lifestyle</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24844</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Design, construction and testing of a high-vacuum anneal chamber for in-situ crystallisation of silicon thin-film solar cells</field><field name="creator">Weber, J??rgen Wolfgang, Photovoltaic &amp; Renewable Engergy Engineering, UNSW</field><field name="description">Thin-film solar cells on glass substrates are likely to have a bright future due to the potentially low costs and the short energy payback times. Polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si, grain size &amp;gt 1 pm) has the advantage of being non-toxic, abundant, and long-term stable. Glass as a substrate, however, limits the processing temperatures to ~600??C for longer process steps. Films with large grain size can be achieved by solid phase crystallisation (SPC), and especially by solid phase epitaxy (SPE) on seed layers, using amorphous silicon deposited at low temperatures as a precursor film. With SPC and SPE, the amorphous silicon film is typically crystallised at ~600??C over hours. During this anneal at atmospheric pressure -depending on the properties of the amorphous silicon film- ambient gas can percolate the film and can negatively affect the crystallisation. In this work, a high-vacuum anneal chamber was designed and built to allow the in-situ crystallisation of amorphous silicon films deposited on glass in a PECVD cluster tool. An important aspect of the design was the comfortable and safe operation of the vacuum anneal chamber to enable unattended operation. This was realised by means of a state-of-the-art, programmable temperature controller and a control circuit design that incorporates various safety interlocks. The chamber interior was optimised such that a temperature uniformity of 2-3K across the sample area was achieved. The chamber was calibrated and tested, and SPC and SPE samples were successfully crystallised. In initial SPC crystallisation experiments with solar cell structures, after post-deposition treatments, a 1 -sun open-circuit voltage of 465 mV was obtained, similar to furnace-annealed samples. In initial experiments with SPE solar cell structures, difficulties regarding the characterisation of the unmetallised solar cells with the quasi-steady-state open-circuit voltage method (QSSVOC) were encountered after post-deposition hydrogen treatment. A possible explanation for these difficulties is the contact formation with the metal probes. Furthermore, limiting factors of the QSSVOC method for the characterisation of unmetallised cells with high contact resistance values were investigated and, additionally, the accuracyof the QSSVOC setup was improved in the low light intensity range.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">vacuum annealing</field><field name="subject">solar cells</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">crystallisation</field><field name="subject">SPC</field><field name="subject">SPE</field><field name="subject">Suns-Voc</field><field name="subject">QSSVOC</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24847</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of sustainability reporting by companies in the Australian coal mining industry to public &amp; regulatory audiences</field><field name="creator">Stewart, Alyssa, Mining, UNSW</field><field name="description">In the lead-up to the Johannesburg World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002, several documents were published by the mining industry declaring the important role that public sustainability reporting had to play in driving sustainable development and pointing to the Global Reporting Initiative???s (GRI) 2002 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines as a suitable vehicle for this. With the aim of finding ways to improve the quantity and quality of public sustainability reporting within the Australian coal mining industry, this study set out to investigate the current sustainability reporting practices of companies involved in the industry. A survey was conducted of the public financial and non-financial reporting practices of all companies with a significant interest in a New South Wales or Queensland coal mine. Three survey cycles were completed covering the 2001, 2002 and 2003 calendar years and the 2001/02, 2002/03 and 2003/04 financial years. The reporting practices were determined both in terms of frequency of report production and contents of reports. A GRI-based content analysis tool was used to measure the amount of sustainability information contained in the company reports. It was found that only around a quarter of companies produced a nonfinancial report and that almost half did not produce any public reports, with the number of unlisted companies publicly reporting particularly low. Whilst a wide range of reporting practices were observed with regard to content, the frequency of Economic, Environmental and Social Performance Indicators in reports was generally found to be low. An investigation of the regulatory reporting requirements on companies was then conducted to determine what sustainability information companies could report with data that they already had at hand. The same GRI-based content analysis tool was used to analyse a variety of regulatory documents. It was found that companies did not publicly disclose a significant amount of the environmental data that they are required to report to regulators. The study also evaluated the reporting capacity of non-reporters and found that, with the exception of Governance Structure and Management Systems elements, large unlisted companies had similar regulatory reporting requirements to listed companies.  However, smaller unlisted companies had fewer requirements to report Profile and Economic elements. Finally, the influences of company ownership structure, non-financial reporting status, industrial sector, nationality and participation in voluntary initiatives on sustainability reporting practices were investigated. It was concluded that in order for public sustainability reporting to be a useful tool in driving sustainable development, focus needed to shift from ???best practice??? to ???common practice??? so that a critical mass of reporters is amassed to allow benchmarking of performance.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Public Sustainability Reporting</field><field name="subject">CSR</field><field name="subject">Mining</field><field name="subject">GRI</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24850</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Atomically controlled device fabrication using STM</field><field name="creator">Ruess, Frank Joachim, Physics, Faculty of Science, UNSW</field><field name="description">We present the development of a novel, UHV-compatible device fabrication strategy for the realisation of nano- and atomic-scale devices in silicon by harnessing the atomic-resolution capability of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM).  We develop etched registration markers in the silicon substrate in combination with a custom-designed STM/ molecular beam epitaxy system (MBE) to solve one of the key problems in STM device fabrication ??? connecting devices, fabricated in UHV, to the outside world. Using hydrogen-based STM lithography in combination with phosphine, as a dopant source, and silicon MBE, we then go on to fabricate several planar Si:P devices on one chip, including control devices that demonstrate the efficiency of each stage of the fabrication process.  We demonstrate that we can perform four terminal magnetoconductance measurements at cryogenic temperatures after ex-situ alignment of metal contacts to the buried device. Using this process, we demonstrate the lateral confinement of P dopants in a delta-doped plane to a line of width 90nm; and observe the cross-over from 2D to 1D magnetotransport. These measurements enable us to extract the wire width which is in excellent agreement with STM images of the patterned wire.  We then create STM-patterned Si:P wires with widths from 90nm to 8nm that show ohmic conduction and low resistivities of 1 to 20 micro Ohm-cm respectively ??? some of the highest conductivity wires reported in silicon. We study the dominant scattering mechanisms in the wires and find that temperature-dependent magnetoconductance can be described by a combination of both 1D weak localisation and 1D electron-electron interaction theories with a potential crossover to strong localisation at lower temperatures.  We present results from STM-patterned tunnel junctions with gap sizes of 50nm and 17nm exhibiting clean, non-linear characteristics. We also present preliminary conductance results from a 70nm long and 90nm wide dot between source-drain leads which show evidence of Coulomb blockade behaviour. The thesis demonstrates the viability of using STM lithography to make devices in silicon down to atomic-scale dimensions. In particular, we show the enormous potential of this technology to directly correlate images of the doped regions with ex-situ electrical device characteristics.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">scanning tunneling microscopy</field><field name="subject">silicon</field><field name="subject">quantum devices</field><field name="subject">nanoelectronics</field><field name="subject">doping</field><field name="subject">registration markers</field><field name="subject">STM device fabrication</field><field name="subject">quantum computer</field><field name="subject">single atom electronics</field><field name="subject">tunnel junctions</field><field name="subject">nanowires</field><field name="subject">quantum dots</field><field name="subject">metal dots</field><field name="subject">weak localisation</field><field name="subject">strong localisation</field><field name="subject">phosphine</field><field name="subject">dephasing</field><field name="subject">electron transport</field><field name="subject">magnetotransport</field><field name="subject">planar device architecture</field><field name="subject">low temeperature measurements</field><field name="subject">Coulomb blockade</field><field name="subject">STM</field><field name="subject">electron electron interactions</field><field name="subject">dimensioncal crossover</field><field name="subject">ultra high vacuum</field><field name="subject">hydrogen resist</field><field name="subject">lithography</field><field name="subject">STM lithography</field><field name="subject">molecular adsorption</field><field name="subject">electrical dopant activation</field><field name="subject">disordered electron systems</field><field name="subject">electron phase coherence length</field><field name="subject">photon assisted carrier generation</field><field name="subject">tunnelling</field><field name="subject">delta doping</field><field name="subject">molecular beam epitaxy</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24855</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reconstructing the creative life of Australian composer Margaret Sutherland: the evidence of primary source documents</field><field name="creator">Watters-Cowan, Ch??rie, School of Music &amp; Music Education, UNSW</field><field name="description">Margaret Ada Sutherland (1897-1984) is respected as one of the leading musicians in Australia in the twentieth century. She is widely recognised as having made significant contributions to the development of Australian musical composition and contemporary creative life. While a significant body of scholarly work has been completed on Sutherland and while it is varied in scope and purpose, to date, no study has been undertaken with a strong focus on the identification and examination of primary sources relating to Sutherland. Research on Sutherland and her creative life has been consistently hampered by problems such as numerous lacunae in the composer???s corpus of works and the transmission of errors from one study to the next. It is the thesis of this study that these problems can be addressed by a reevaluation of all previously-used primary documents as well as the study of newlyfound primary source material: returning to primary sources has uncovered a considerable amount of material, both by and about the composer, which has remained previously unexplored. In order to address omissions in Sutherland???s work list, the starting point for the current study is the compilation of a thorough catalogue of works which incorporates all known compositions by Sutherland. This catalogue is derived from the collation of comprehensive primary source material. Further to this, the close examination of extensive primary sources relating to Sutherland???s life and music provides insights into aspects of the contemporary musical network in which she worked and also into the particular problems she encountered as a female composer in a geographically isolated country. The diversity of her achievements is also illuminated. The resources used in this thesis provide the material which will enhance, augment, and sometimes offer new perspectives relating to the current understanding of Sutherland???s creative life. Thus, Sutherland???s contribution to Australian music can be more deeply understood.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">EN</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Women composers - Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://handle.unsw.edu.au/1959.4/24913</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processing and characterisation of nano-enhanced composites</field><field name="creator">Frederick, Armstrong</field><field name="description">Since the discovery of nanomaterials in early ninety&#8217;s, a remarkable progress in the synthesis of nanocomposites has been reported looking for a new better material with improved physical and chemical properties for a variety of applications in almost all fields. The science and technology of nanocomposites has created great excitement and expectations in the last decade too. In addition to that, researches in this area have been focusing on the nanoscale second phase embedded in the polymeric matrix that gives physical and chemical properties that cannot be achieved by ordinary material synthesis methods. Researchers have also discovered that incorporating the right amount of nanoparticles into a polymer matrix pose a remarkable strength and flexibility and that industries should be able to integrate the outcome of their researches widely in high performance applications in the field of biomedical engineering, aerospace, marine, high speed parts in engines, packaging and sports gadgets. With the new methods of synthesis and tools for characterisation, nanocomposite science and technology is now experiencing explosive growth. Taking advantage of the need and the properties of the nanomaterials, through this research a new nano-enhanced composite is developed through addition of nanofiller into epoxy matrix to cater for varied applications.  The physical and mechanical properties of the identified nanomaterial reinforced polymer composite were characterised by experimentation in order to ascertain the improvement in tensile, compressive and flexural properties as well as the adhesion of the matrix to the substrate. Also, while addressing potential enhancements like improved mechanical strength, better dimensional stability, higher thermal stability, better abrasion resistance, hard and wear resistance, better chemical properties like better flame retardance, anticorrosive and antioxidation, adequate importance was given to easy and bulk processability and most importantly the commercial viability as well. This nano-enhanced nanocomposite was then optimised. Based on these results, it has been established that epoxy reinforced with 1% percent of nanoclay can significantly improve the mechanical properties without compromising the weight or processability of the composite. Thus, a futuristic and much promising nano-enhanced epoxy composite has been successfully made ready for commercialisation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Nano-composites</field><field name="subject">Nano-materials</field><field name="subject">Enhancement</field><field name="subject">Properties</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/804</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Botanica: the earthly divine</field><field name="creator">Gannon, Eleanor</field><field name="description">Drawing inspiration from Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, this project seeks to incorporate the oxymetaphor, digital photography and photo manipulation into considerations of Heaven, Hell and Purgatory. By considering the potential of an earthly site of transition (the cemetery) in relation to Dante's divine spaces, these images consider certain contradictions existing between the cemetery as a manifestation of waiting, permanence, and decay, and its associations with temporality and transition. The cemetery is therefore an oxymoron. It suggests both a beginning and an end; growth and decay; a place of closure and a pace of transition. Although Heaven, Hell and Purgatory have distinct characteristics in these images, there are commonalities between their layered treatments and iconography that unify them as a whole.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Graphics</field><field name="subject">Photography</field><field name="subject">Divine</field><field name="subject">Botany</field><field name="subject">Metaphor</field><field name="subject">Schon</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/805</field></doc><doc><field name="title">They have come a long way : the settlement of the 1980's Solidarity wave of Polish immigrants in Melbourne</field><field name="creator">Drozd, Elizabeth</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was to research the settlement of the Solidarity wave of Polish immigrants in Melbourne who arrived in Australia between 1980-84 and thus reduce the gap in knowledge about this group of immigrants. Because of the limited knowledge available about the settlement outcomes of Polish immigrants, a comprehensive data collection process was undertaken through interviews involving 60 participants.        This thesis comprises six chapters beginning with the context of this research, followed by a brief history of Polish community migration to Australia including statistical information. 198083 were the peak years of the second wave of Polish migration to Australia, the majority of whom came as refugees and under the Special Humanitarian Program at the time of political and economic turning points in the recent history of Poland. These immigrants left Poland for political and economic reasons, because they had had enough of the system - the politics, the economy and the consequences of both, the way Poland functioned at that time, and were pessimistic about its improvement and thus improvement of their own future. They came mainly in family units, at the prime of their lives (25-34 years in age), with a high level of education and from a highly urbanised environment where accommodation was scarce and where there was a shortage of goods including food items. Some had high status positions before leaving Polan d. A large number of these immigrants had travelled abroad from Poland previously but only one of the interviewees had been in Australia before. The affluence of the West, compared to Poland, also played an important role in these immigrants deciding to leave their home country. To the majority of them, Australia was their preferred country of migration.         Men were the driving force in deciding to leave Poland and less than 20 per cent of couples made the decision mutually. With some couples, the male arrived in Australia first and then sponsored his wife and children.         Their 'road' from Poland to Australia was usually through a transit country in Europe ego Austria, Germany, where they were obliged to wait on average several months before a permanent visa was obtained for Australia. They arrived with no or only a few possessions but had hope, courage and willingness to work to establish theirs and their children's lives in their adopted country. They had little knowledge of Australia, particularly the day-to-day aspects of living here. The 1980s wave of Polish immigrants imagined Australia to have European architecture and be less multicultural. Their reasons for wanting to migrate to Australia were because of having a relative or a friend here, and because there were attracted to Australia as a rich and unspoiled country, with a democratic system and a climate to be envied. They also thought Australia to be one of the best countries for immigrants to settle in. These immigrants had little knowledge of Polonia in Australia and only a quarter could understand English.         Upon arrival, they stayed in migrant hostels in Melbourne where they attended English language classes and accessed a range of support services available to them. Their first impressions of Australia were negative, at times very negative, however, this did not seem to affect their settlement over the long term.         After 10-14 years of living in Australia, these immigrants have come a long way in their settlement. This includes their English language proficiency, occupational status, social support networks, job and life satisfaction. These achievements did not come easy, but they resulted from hard work, further education, compromises and utilisation of skills and knowledge which they brought with them. Also helpful was the range of support services available to them and the Australian policy of multiculturalism. Not all have succeeded and many paid a price for migration ego marriage break up, deterioration in health, are unemployed, have no contact with their close families in Poland. The most difficult thing to cope with in the initial years of settlement for these immigrants was learning English and not being able to communicate in that language yet being required to work on establishing their lives in Australia. They also experienced high levels of isolation and stress and missed their families in Poland. Their o ccupational adjustment was also difficult although with time many have regained their occupational status and now work in positions commensurate with their skills and qualifications. They did not recall the process of qualifications recognition as a difficult one but believed that staff at the appropriate agencies could have been more attentive and more proactive to these migrants' particular needs.         At the time of the interview, only eight per cent often had difficulties with understanding English and another 16 per cent had such difficulties sometimes. Their written English proficiency was significantly lower, 34 per cent experienced difficulties often or very often and another 20 per cent sometimes. Whilst a quarter were not interested in pursuing their English language skills further, just over half were interested, especially in wanting to improve their written skills.         Approximately half of these immigrants undertook further or additional studies at Technical and Further Education (TAFE) colleges and universities and another half participated in private vocational courses. Undertaking further or additional studies played a very significant role in the 1980s Solidarity wave of Polish immigrants regaining their occupational status and acquisition of good English language skills. Fifty two per cent of these immigrants worked as labourers and machine operators in their first jobs in Australia, now this percentage is 24 which is still very considerably higher when compared to Poland where only four per cent of them worked as machine operators and none worked as a labourer. After 10-14 years in Australia, the majority of the study group worked as professionals and para-professionals, technicians and service workers. No male interviewee was working as a labourer and only six per cent continued to work as machine operators. Female interviewees have not done as well in their occup ational adjustment, 12 per cent continue to work as labourers and 27 per cent as machine operators. This study found that there was a high level of job satisfaction amongst this wave of Polish immigrants, however, compared to Poland, their job satisfaction was lower. Twelve per cent of the study sample were unemployed, usually unemployed for a substantial period due to English language difficulties and overall lack of jobs. Polish immigrants strongly believed that job opportunities for immigrants in Australia are worse compared to Australian-born persons.         With regards to social support networks, it was found that Polish immigrants had good levels of such networks and that the vast majority of these were involving other Polish immigrants. There was also contact with people from other cultural backgrounds but it was often more distant and not as regular. As with the first large wave of Polish immigrants to Australia, this group also relies on themselves at times of need and do not use welfare services other than the Department of Social Security.         Study findings indicated a very high level of life satisfaction amongst this group of immigrants and 65 per cent believed that their standard of living had improved since leaving Poland. They hold Australia in high regard. What these immigrants liked about their lives in Australia was their accommodation, adequate remuneration, the economic and political stability, life stability, comfortable and peaceful living conditions. Seventy per cent of these immigrants were in the process of paying off their homes or have already done so. They continue to be in good health generally, but 30 per cent felt that their health had deteriorated since leaving Poland. These immigrants also had some dislikes regarding their lives in Australia and these included demanding work lifestyles, different social life, some Australian attitudes and the tyranny of distance. Overall, three quarters assessed their decision to migrate as good or very good and ten per cent as bad or very bad. In general, Polish immigrants were not conside ring a return migration to Poland.         Amongst the negative outcomes of migration for these immigrants, was the relatively high marriage breakdown (23%). On the other hand, data on marriage assessment revealed that no interviewee assessed their marriage as unsatisfactory. With couples who remained married, a third believed that migration had had a positive effect on their marriage.         This study also aimed to develop a brief profile of children of these immigrants who were found to speak Polish well. Only five per cent could not speak' Polish at all. Parents went to great lengths to ensure that their children maintained the Polish language, In contrast, two thirds of these children did not participate in Polish community life,         This research also documented the bicultural identity, in particular these immigrants' identity, links with their mother culture and country, participation in Australian social institutions, attitudes to multiculturalism and other ethnic groups, Ninety per cent of the 1980s Solidarity wave of Polish immigrants continue to identify as Polish and Polish-Australians. The feeling of Polish identity was strong for well over half of interviewees, and feeling Australian strongly or very strongly was stated by only 15 per cent. No interviewee stated his/her identity as being Australian although 97 per cent of these immigrants had acquired Australian citizenship. These immigrants maintained links with Poland and their families there, including inviting relatives for holidays to Australia and Visiting Poland themselves. They continue to eat Polish cuisine and celebrate Christmas and Easter in the traditional Polish way. Eighty five per cent of these Polish immigrants found it very important or important to maintain t he Polish culture and 80 per cent put such importance on Polish language maintenance. Their membership of Polish organisations is low, mainly due to lack of time and lack of interest or need. Participation in Polish community functions was reasonably low with only a quarter attending such functions regularly. Further, the majority knew about the 3EA Polish radio program, again, only a quarter listen to it regularly which was partly due to the broadcast time (1.00pm). Polish Weekly was the mostly commonly read Polish newspaper, followed by newspapers from Poland. Generally, the Polish media in Melbourne was not assessed in a positive light. These immigrants also had a negative view of the Polish community as a group in Australia, including Polish organisations and typical Polish characteristics. Church participation by these immigrants has decreased since their arrival.         In regards to political preferences, half of these Polish immigrants tended to vote for the Liberal Party and between 20-32 per cent tended to vote for the Australian Labour Party. Half of the interviewees followed the political processes in Australia, however, no one belonged to a political party.         They were reluctant to accept people from some cultures such as Middle Eastern or Asian. Multiculturalism was seen by them as a positive aspect of Australia and one which helps immigrants in settlement.         These immigrants were not refugees but migrated in refugee like situations. They do not fit any of the immigrant or refugee settlement models. A new typology for these immigrants is developed using criteria such as: job and life satisfaction, English language proficiency, maintenance of Polish culture and language and adoption of the' Australian culture,</field><field name="date">1997</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Polish</field><field name="subject">Immigrants</field><field name="subject">Settlement</field><field name="subject">Refugees</field><field name="subject">Solidarity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091215.114852</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The pioneering press of Poverty Bay : 1872-1914</field><field name="creator">Rees-Jones, Anna Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the significance of the newspaper press in a settler society, in this case Poverty Bay on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It examines the circumstances of such a society's communications needs and problems, and its demographic structure. It also looks at the changing patterns of journalism in nineteenth century New Zealand and elsewhere and, importantly, printing's technological progress as it affected a provincial newspaper.       Remoteness was a dominating feature of the Poverty Bay district and European settlement was slow to develop. The consequence was twofold: institutions, such as the church, the press and the school, were already well-established in New Zealand by the time this second frontier region began to attract much attention - in the case of the press this meant an interconnectedness from the outset, with ideas and staff emanating from established New Zealand circles - and communication difficulties caused by isolation. Poverty Bay's first newspaper, the Poverty Bay Standard, began in 1872, more than thirty years after New Zealand's first newspaper, the New Zealand Gazette. The 1870s saw a clamour of activity. This was reflected in the district's press, not only within its pages, but also with considerable competition and changing of ownership. Eventually one newspaper, the Poverty Bay Herald, succeeded where all others failed.        The Poverty Bay Herald has remained in the hands of one family since experienced printer Allan Ramsay Muir became part-owner in 1884. Thus, the family and the community have been intertwined for one hundred and twenty years.        Good provincial newspapers provide a cohesive element in their society or they do not succeed. The Poverty Bay Herald initially survived through luck and useful friends but it became a beacon for its community in that it reflected success and modernity. Many others attempted to dislodge it or share the stage, but the Poverty Bay Herald played, and still plays, a significant role as the former 'out district' stabilized and advanced.</field><field name="date">2004</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gisborne Herald</field><field name="subject">New Zealand</field><field name="subject">Newspapers</field><field name="subject">Poverty Bay</field><field name="subject">Colonial Press</field><field name="subject">NZ Provincial Press</field><field name="subject">Muir</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091215.165142</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Search For Common Pleasures: CURATING THE CITY</field><field name="creator">Helsel, Sand</field><field name="description">The project-based research questions how professionals working in the built environment can engage a broader range of 'others' (students, client, users) in ways of seeing and acting in a meaningful way.

The thesis examines this assertion by investigating one type of multimedia activity defined (for the purposes of this research) as a digital audio video assessment (DAVA).      Data was collected using a constructivist epistemology, interpretative and naturalistic perspective using primarily a qualitative methodology. Three types of data collection methods were used to collect data from thirteen Diploma of Event Management students from William Angliss TAFE. Firstly, participants completed the Biggs Study Process Questionnaire (2001) which is a predictor of deep and surface learning preference. Each participant then engaged in a semi-structured interview that elicited participant's self-declared learning preferences and their approaches to completion of the DAVA. These data sources were then compared. Six factors that are critical in informing the way that the participants approached the DAVA emerged from the analysis of the data. Based on these findings it is concluded that the DAVA does not restrict, inhibit or negatively influence a participants learning preference. Learners with a pre-existing, stable learning preference are likely to adopt a learning approach that is consisten t with their preference. Participants that have a learning preference that is less stable (more flexible) may adopt either a surface or deep approach depending on the specific task, activity or assessment.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning Styles</field><field name="subject">digital storytelling</field><field name="subject">multimedia</field><field name="subject">event management</field><field name="subject">deep and surface learning</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091216.154300</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Predicting Life Expectancy of Concrete Septic Tanks Exposed to Sulphate and Biogenic Sulphuric Acid Attack</field><field name="creator">Hasan, Md Saeed</field><field name="description">The prediction of the expected long-term performance of concrete exposed to sewage and similar materials can be difficult as it is affected by a large number of parameters. In addition, the deterioration process in concrete is generally slow.   The focus of the study was to ascertain the life expectancy of concrete septic tanks located in rural Victoria. In developing the accelerated test method, ASTM C 192, ASTM C 452, ASTM C 1293 and ASTM C 109 standard procedures were adopted wherever possible.   From the analysis of mass change data after 350 days, it was found that the mass change rate for concrete in sulphate solutions increases with the increase of concentration of Na2SO4 solution. The weights of the samples in Na2SO4 solution increased with time, whereas the control specimens lost weight as a result of heating cycles. The probable reason for weight increase in Na2SO4 solution was hypothesized as the formation of gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) and ettringite (3CaO.Al2O.3CaSO4.32H2O), which is confirmed from microstructural analysis. The rate of weight gain was higher at the beginning and reduced with time. The stronger the concentration of Na2SO4 the stronger was the weight gain or expansion of mass. All the samples in sulphate solutions attained their maximum weight at around 250 days.   For the specimens in sulphuric acid solutions weight loss was observed to be higher for higher concentrations. The lower the pH of the acidic solutions, the larger was the weight loss. The weight loss of specimens in acidic solutions exceeded the control specimen after 250 days. The reason for the loss of weight of the samples in sulphuric acid may be the decalcification of C-S-H gel within the concrete, and as a consequence the loss of cementitious structure.   Comparison of the corrosion of concrete and also microstructural examination of field samples confirmed that the deterioration mechanism is similar to that observed in the laboratory. The accelerated testing adopted here offers a realistic method of predicting the deterioration of septic tanks under biogenic sulphuric acid corrosion. Two equations have been proposed to predict deterioration due to sulphate attack and sulphuric acid attack as mass loss (or gain) with time.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sulphate attack</field><field name="subject">Biogenic sulphuric acid</field><field name="subject">Ettringite</field><field name="subject">Septic tank</field><field name="subject">Life expectancy</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091217.102006</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Study of the Implementation of a Problem-Based Learning Approach in University Classes in Vietnam</field><field name="creator">Nguyen, Danh Duc</field><field name="description">In a period of significant global scientific and technological change tertiary students need to be more adequately prepared to effectively integrate into the competitive working environments of the 21st century. For this reason, these students need to be educated to use a variety of skills such as problem-solving and teamwork to support them in their future working conditions. These skills can be acquired through the use of a range of innovative approaches. A variety of these approaches is being introduced in a range of university courses in different institutions in the western world, including problem-based learning (PBL). The problem-based learning approach is also now being introduced to more traditional learning environments in Asian institutions such as Singapore and Malaysia. My study extends this innovative pedagogical approach, exploring the implementation of a PBL approach across a number of undergraduate classes in two universities in the South of Viet nam. It also reports on the students' perspectives in learning through a PBL approach.      This study examines the impact of a PBL approach when it was introduced in a range of Vietnamese undergraduate courses. A group of eleven university teachers in two universities in the South of Vietnam were approached by the investigator and agreed to be involved in the study as individual cases for investigation. The teachers implemented a PBL approach to teaching in one of their undergraduate classes. In addition, 182 students from eleven different classes where a PBL approach was implemented agreed to discuss their perceptions of this shift in their learning approach.       Questionnaires and interviews were conducted with both the teachers and their students for the purpose of gathering data related to the impact of the PBL approach on the student and staff experiences. The study shows that Vietnamese teachers and students effectively adopted a PBL approach, and they commented on the worth of PBL for their teaching and learning. Both the teaching staff and students engaged willingly with the PBL approach. Although some assessment approaches were used that reflected the focus of PBL, there was still a heavy reliance on testing as the major form of assessment.       The study is expected to contribute to Vietnamese education by providing an evaluation of the PBL implementation processes. The examination of all aspects of PBL implementation has the potential to provide educators with a critical analysis of the processes in order to support their understandings when making the decision to broaden the teaching and learning approaches currently used. Further, the study affirms the implementation of PBL as a significant contribution in preparing learners to negotiate complex demands of the 21st century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Problem-based learning</field><field name="subject">implementation</field><field name="subject">approach and perception</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091217.115207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An investigation of hybrid density functional theory in the calculation of the structure and properties of transition metal oxides</field><field name="creator">Wilson, Nicholas Craig</field><field name="description">This thesis is an investigation into the accuracy of hybrid density functional theory to predict the properties of two transition metal oxides: Ilmenite (FeTiO3) and haematite (sigma-Fe2O3). The hybrid density functional theory examined is Becke's B3LYP functional, which is an empirical mix of density functional theory and exact nonlocal exchange from Hartree-Fock theory. For bulk ilmenite, results from the B3LYP functional are compared with Hartree-Fock and pure density functional theory calculations. The computed properties are found to be very sensitive to the treatment of electronic exchange and correlation, with the best results being achieved using the hybrid functional. Calculations performed using the hybrid functional benefit from its better treatment of the electronic self interaction and its reasonable estimate of the pair correlation energy of the doubly occupied Fe-d orbital.      To assess the performance of the hybrid functional in simulating Fe2O3 and FeTiO3 with different cation-anion coordination than that found in ilmenite or haematite, studies were performed on their high pressure polymorphs, for which there are a range of experimental results for comparison. This tests the transferability of the functional before examining cases, such as the surfaces of these materials, where there are little or no experimental or theoretical results.      For the currently known high pressure polymorphs of ilmenite and haematite, the structural and elastic parameters computed using the hybrid functional are found to be in good agreement with those observed, as is the predicted stability of the phases. In ilmenite, the calculations predict the stability of a new high-pressure polymorph with space group Cmcm, occurring at pressures above 44 GPa. Calculations of the high pressure polymorphs of haematite involve the examination of a range of charge, spin, and magnetic states for each of the polymorphs. Magnetic ordering was found to be important for all the polymorphs, and for each polymorph an antiferromagnetic ordering was found to be lower in energy than the ferromagnetic ordering. The predicted transition pressure from the corundum structure and the magnetic collapse of the Fe3+ cations were in good agreement with experiment.  At high pressures the lowest energy configuration for the orthorhombic perovskite structure was computed to occur with mixed high-spin /low-spin Fe3+ cations, in contrast to predictions in the literature of a Fe2+/Fe4+ solution. The CaIrO3-type structure was also computed to be stable with a mixed high-spin/ low-spin Fe3+ configuration at high pressures, and is computed to be the most stable polymorph at pressures above 46 GPa at 0 K.       The structure of the ilmenite (0001) surface is examined using the B3LYP functional, and for this surface twelve different terminations are considered, with surface energies and relaxed geometries calculated. The Fe terminated (0001) surface was found to have the lowest cleavage energy, and also to be the most stable surface at low oxygen partial pressures suggesting it is most likely to form when ilmenite is cleaved under high vacuum.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hybrid Density Functional Theory</field><field name="subject">Transition Metal Oxides</field><field name="subject">Surface Properties</field><field name="subject">Bulk Properties</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091217.142149</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Topology optimization of periodic structures</field><field name="creator">Zuo, Zihao</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates topology optimization techniques for periodic continuum structures at the macroscopic level. Periodic structures are increasingly used in the design of structural systems and sub-systems of buildings, vehicles, aircrafts, etc. The duplication of identical or similar modules significantly reduces the manufacturing cost and greatly simplifies the assembly process. Optimization of periodic structures in the micro level has been extensively researched in the context of material design, while research on topology optimization for macrostructures is very limited and has great potential both economically and intellectually.   In the present thesis, numerical algorithms based on the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method (BESO) are developed for topology optimization for various objectives and constraints. Soft-kill (replacing void elements with soft elements) formulations of topology optimization problems for solid-void solutions are developed through appropriate material interpolation schemes. Incorporating the optimality criteria and algorithms for mesh-independence and solution-convergence, the present BESO becomes a reliable gradient based technique for topology optimization. Additionally, a new combination of genetic algorithms (GAs) with BESO is developed in order to stochastically search for the global optima. These enhanced BESO algorithms are applied to various optimization problems with the periodicity requirement as an extra constraint aiming at producing periodicity in the layout.   For structures under static loading, the present thesis addresses minimization of the mean compliance and explores the applications of conventional stiffness optimization for periodic structures. Furthermore, this thesis develops a volume minimization formulation where the maximum deflection is constrained. For the design of structures subject to dynamic loading, this thesis develops two different approaches (hard-kill and soft-kill) to resolving the problem of localized or artificial modes. In the hard-kill (completely removing void elements) approach, extra control measures are taken in order to eliminate the localized modes in an explicit manner. In the soft-kill approach, a modified power low material model is presented to prevent the occurrence of artificial and localized modes.   Periodic stress and strain fields cannot be assumed in structures under arbitrary loadings and boundaries at the macroscopic level. Therefore being different from material design, no natural base cell can be directly extracted from macrostructures. In this thesis, the concept of an imaginary representative unit cell (RUC) is presented. For situations when the structure cannot be discretized into equally-sized elements, the concept of sensitivity density is developed in order for mesh-independent robust solutions to be produced. The RUC and sensitivity density based approach is incorporated into various topology optimization problems to obtain absolute or scaled periodicities in structure layouts. The influence of this extra constraint on the final optima is investigated based on a large number of numerical experiments.   The findings shown in this thesis have established appropriate techniques for designing and optimizing periodic structures. The work has provided a solid foundation for creating a practical design tool in the form of a user-friendly computer program suitable for the conceptual design of a wide range of structures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Topology optimization</field><field name="subject">bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO)</field><field name="subject">periodic structures</field><field name="subject">periodic design</field><field name="subject">stiffness optimization</field><field name="subject">frequency optimization</field><field name="subject">eigenvalue</field><field name="subject">genetic algorithms</field><field name="subject">finite element analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091217.151415</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Beyond the region: the learning region</field><field name="creator">Badenhorst, Anne</field><field name="description">In a global economy and a world of increasing polarisation and unsustainable development, learning is critical to change. With most of the world's population in cities and the region increasingly the focus of measures to improve prospects, the learning region concept integrates the conflicting, diverse and complex issues of development. This thesis examines learning in networks and further develops the theory of the learning region through a case study in Melbourne, Australia.      It begins with a case study of an industry network which was part of a research project - City Regions, Intelligent Territories, Innovation Competitiveness and Learning (CRITICAL). The CRITICAL research project examined learning processes in five cities and developed theory and tools to support learning regions. In this thesis the study of the industry network became the first step in a case study of the northern metropolitan regional economic development project. The study of the region demonstrated that there existed a strategic regional approach supporting local learning and action developed through projects based on local research and collaboration. The theories of 'communities of practice and 'architectures of learning' (Wenger 1998) provided the conceptual framework for the case study and proved to be a novel way to discern how learning was supported. A key finding in this thesis was how learning in networks was supported and that this led to organisational change, innovation and learning across differ ent sectors and organisations. Data was analysed using a typology of the learning region developed in the CRITICAL project and the region was found to have characteristics of a learning region although without wider connectivity across the city could only be considered a sub region.      The study contributes to the body of work which demonstrates that the university can play a significant role in supporting the learning region and local engagement of key organisations, enterprises and government, and in the understanding of policy and programs to develop learning regions. The findings also contribute to innovation theory particularly with regard to networks and small to medium enterprises in manufacturing. Findings support the development of frameworks for urban regional development with the partnering of different levels of government to create new ways of operating and learning in the emerging mode of local governance partnerships and highlight the need to develop ways of measuring and understanding success or failure which capture the social, economic, cultural and environmental priorities of society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Learning Region</field><field name="subject">Architectures of Learning (Wenger)</field><field name="subject">Learning in networks</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091217.162201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Face of Public Relations in Australia
An inquiry into academic and practitioner perceptions of practice, power, and
professionalism in contemporary Australian public relations</field><field name="creator">Byrne, Katrana Helen</field><field name="description">This dissertation presents research into the public relations field in Australia,
including its background, design, results and recommendations. Research
investigated areas of convergence and divergence of ideas about public relations
practice between Australian practitioners and academics. The project was inspired
by a significant gap in the Australia-specific public relations literature, as there is
limited or no in-depth empirical investigation into notions of meaning, dimensions of
practice, professionalism, organisational power, and education, in the public relations
field in Australia.
While research has been conducted into how those outside the profession view
public relations, few have asked those within the industry (practitioners and
academics) about their understanding of public relations in Australia, nor compared
these findings to locate and analyse spaces of convergence and divergence of
meaning.
Inquiry was facilitated through the administration of two online questionnaires; one
targeted to those identifying as public relations practitioners, and the other for those
who identified as public relations academics. Each questionnaire comprised six
sections, and sought a mixture of in-depth qualitative and quantitative data on the
following areas:
o Meaning, scope and agreement of the term 'public relations'
o The dimensions of public relations
o Perceptions of public relations practice
o Perceptions of public relations scholarship
o Perceptions of public relations education
o Respondent demographics
As non-probability sampling was applied to this study, it is not possible to report a
response rate. That said, a total of 40 academic and 107 practitioner responses
were received and comprise the data set. Administration of the questionnaires
generated a significant amount of both qualitative and quantitative data.
The results were diverse and intriguing, leading to a number of specific
recommendations and suggestions for further research. For example, the study
found that:
o There exists a gap between respondent definitions of the term 'public
relations' and respondent reports of public relations practice;
o Both public relations academics and practitioners underestimate the
professional practice of their practitioner colleagues;
o While most practitioners see academics as adding value to the public
relations field, a considerable proportion do not, yet findings indicate that
academics may not be as out of touch as practitioners imagine;
o Both public relations academics and practitioners conceive notions of
professionalism in the same manner; and
o Both groups identify writing and interpersonal skills as the most valuable skills
for a public relations practitioner to possess, and both groups also prioritise
knowledge of public relations specific theory and principles. Practitioners
also prioritise the need for greater attention to general business practices in
public relations education, while academics determine a need for greater
emphasis of ethical standards and research competence.
This research project closes with a number of direct recommendations and areas for
further inquiry. Among these, it is suggested, for example, that academics become
mindful of underestimating professional practice as doing so may perpetuate
negative images of the field. Rather, academics should be encouraged to seek out
opportunities for collaboration with practitioners. Dialogue between academics and
practitioners can enhance accurate understanding of, not only the dimensions of
practice, but also the value of academia, in the field. Via these, and the other key
lessons and recommendations, the findings and results of this research project have
dramatically furthered efforts to map the landscape of public relations in Australia.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">public relations education</field><field name="subject">public relations practice</field><field name="subject">australia</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091215.092833</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Where meaning collapses: a creative exploration of the role of
humour and laughter in trauma</field><field name="creator">Alston, Sylvia</field><field name="description">The thesis consists of a full-length novel and an exegesis that examines the ways in which humour can be used to restore the symbolic order and serve as a means of regaining control, thus allowing those involved in the most disturbing, painful and challenging situations to feel less powerless.
The research component of the thesis involved critical reading, fieldwork, observations, and personal interviews. The texts examined include works by Michael Billig, Henri Bergson and Julia Kristeva, in particular her reference to the act of laughing at the abject as a kind of horrified 'apocalyptic laughter', a compulsion to confront that which repels (Kristeva 1982, pp. 204-206). As part of the fieldwork, I completed training to become a Laughter Club leader. Laughter Clubs are based on the notion that laughter, even fake laughter, is beneficial. This concept is explored in more detail in the exegesis. The fieldwork also included training in laughter-generating activities for students and staff at two local primary schools. The observational component, which involved the Australian War Memorial, the 'Reveries: Photography and Mortality' exhibition, Norwood Crematorium and the children's garden and babies' rose garden at the Gungahlin cemetery, enabled me to examine images and memories of death as well as the responses of other visitors. The final component of my research involved personal interviews. The participants in these interviews were drawn from a diverse range of fields including: volunteers at a local hospice, hospital clowns, general practitioners, cancer survivors and their carers, a psychiatrist, nurses, a paramedic, a police officer, a hospital teacher and bereaved parents.
The findings from this research provided the framework for the creative piece, a novel set in present-day Canberra. The story begins one autumn evening when thirteen-year-old Sam is found unconscious and bleeding from a head wound. By the time Maggie, Sam's widowed mother, arrives at the hospital, Sam has regained consciousness. His x-rays show a large mass in his brain and he is kept in for further tests. The results confirm that Sam has an inoperable tumour. Maggie and Sam rely on humour in their interactions both with each other and with other people as a means of maintaining that 'baseline of social control' (Kristeva 1982, p. 99), staying on the edge of what Kristeva refers to as the place 'where meaning collapses' (p. 2).
Humour is their anchor, enabling them to maintain a grip on their new normality. And, as if having a dying child isn't enough to cope with, Maggie is being pursued by a handsome and slightly younger man.
Both the findings in my exegesis, and the creative work they led to, suggest that although there has been an enormous amount of research undertaken over the previous thirty or so years, there is no conclusive proof that humour can be closely correlated with health. At best, humour can provide a means of controlling that which would otherwise be outside our control.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fiction</field><field name="subject">coping mehanisms</field><field name="subject">types of humour</field><field name="subject">uses of humour</field><field name="subject">research into humour</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091215.114305</field></doc><doc><field name="title">POLICY IMPLEMENTATION AND
ADMINISTRATIVE ARCHITECTURE
Using the Purchaser Provider Model to Implement ACT
Health and Community Care Delivery Policy</field><field name="creator">Collins, James Patrick</field><field name="description">In their seminal work on policy implementation, Pressman and Wildavsky
(1973:143) have argued that 'there is no point in having good ideas if they
cannot be carried out.' The use of a New Public Management (NPM) service
delivery approach in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) health area,
referred to as the Purchaser Provider Model (PPM), was seen as one of
those good ideas. The then-ACT Government hoped that the use of this
model as part of its public policy reform agenda would assist it in successfully
achieving its goal of restraining the growth of ACT public health care costs.
The PPM was in operation between 1996 and 2002, when it was
discontinued, suggesting a policy implementation failure.
In this thesis, the PPM is used as a case study as a basis for supporting the
argument that the administrative architecture through which public policy is
implemented plays a crucial part in the success or otherwise of the
implementation of that policy, especially in the area of public service delivery.
The administrative architecture is defined as, the administrative components
that have been designed to assist the implementation of public policy.
To undertake the analysis the PPM is expressed in terms of the following
three extremely important components of the administrative architecture:
- the configuration of role and role relationships;
- resource allocation arrangements; and
- the performance management framework.
Pattern matching logic in conjunction with the literature is used to show how
crucial was the part played by the above components and hence the
administrative architecture in the implementation of public policy.
While the thesis provides compelling evidence (based on the case study and
the academic literature) to support its claim, the crucial part played by the
administrative architecture in the implementation of public policy, especially
in the area of service delivery, has hitherto received little attention in the
implementation literature.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Health funding</field><field name="subject">ACT</field><field name="subject">public policy</field><field name="subject">health sector</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091215.140820</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling Medical Insurance Reform in China -
Distributional Effects for Urban Employees and Residents</field><field name="creator">Xiong, Linping</field><field name="description">In the last decade or so, China has begun to reform its health care system nationwide, due to pressures like an ageing population and increasing demand on health services. In the late 1990s, the Chinese government established the medical insurance scheme for urban employees and retirees. Then, in 2003, a new rural co-operative medical insurance scheme was established for rural areas in China. Most recently, in late 2007, a medical insurance program was introduced in 79 pilot cities, aiming to cover all urban residents who are not in the labour market and with all urban residents becoming beneficiaries by 2010.
Given China's considerable size and diversity, both geographically and demographically, the reform of the medical care system faces many challenges. It is important to analyse and evaluate the impact of the reform on individuals' health care benefits and on their financial burden due to medical expenses.
This research investigates the sustainability of the urban medical insurance system, involving both urban employed individuals and non-working residents. The key aims focus on three aspects. First, it assesses the distributional impacts of medical insurance policies and predicts medical expenses for urban employees and retirees. Second, it estimates the potential urban resident population entering the medical insurance scheme and predicts the medical costs. Third, it estimates and evaluates the contribution of the differing levels of the Chinese government to the medical insurance scheme.
With co-operation from the Bureau of Labour and Social Security of Kunming (capital city of Yunnan Province, China), this thesis creates two static microsimulation models for predicting and evaluating the medical insurance policies in China's urban areas. The model for urban employees and retirees investigates the balances of the social pool fund and personal savings accounts, and the medical expenses shared by different kinds of payment modes. The model for non-working urban residents predicts the distributional impacts on families, estimates the medical expenses and evaluates the insurance capacity of the social pool fund.
Three kinds of data are used in the research. The first is the individual level data of medical care records of the urban employees and retirees in Kunming. This administrative data helps to create the microsimulation model for urban employees and retirees for the period of 2006-2010. The second type of data involves the 0.1 per cent sample of the National Population Census in 2000 and the results of the 2005 Population Survey. These data provide the demographic information on urban residents and updated population structures. The third data type provides information on health service use of urban residents, which mainly comes from the second and the third National Health Services Surveys of 1998 and 2003.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">health care</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="subject">social security</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091215.151814</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An Investigation of Isan Textiles at the Village Level in North-Eastern Thailand
with Particular Reference to Design and Manufacturing Strategies</field><field name="creator">Stone, Anasee Pengsaa</field><field name="description">This research is set in the context of a collaborative agreement between the Industrial Design
Department, University of Canberra and the Faculty of Applied Art and Design at Ubon
Rajathanee University in the northeast or Isan region of Thailand. In this thesis the textile
production of the region was studied with an objective of evaluating the potential for
product design process to positively influence production outcomes. Traditional textile
production techniques could be lost because these processes are complex and slow, and
the current environment, both physical and operational, is changing rapidly. Product
design and the design process are relevant to the industrial development of Thailand and
village textile production could benefit from structured design and manufacturing
strategies that have a consumer focus and improved production outcomes. From a critical
review of the relevant literature, it was found that village weavers valued the traditions of
their craft and traditional patterns and colours were important in terms of cultural identity and
village social organization. Product design process or more specifically, the Generic Design
Process (GDP) was reviewed and a model developed that adapted the GDP to the prevailing
research environment. The findings led to a program of field research including village
interviews where the major issue of the devaluation of traditional natural material dyeing
techniques was identified. Field experiments tested alternative dyeing techniques which were
evaluated in a survey by village weavers. During the field research care was taken to adapt to
the way in which village weavers lived and worked as the two activities were closely
interrelated. The degree of skill and knowledge residing in the aging women, who constitute
the majority of village weavers, in extensive and profound, and is often described as an
example of local wisdom. The theoretical and experimental work has been related, with
appropriate results and conclusions, to the potential for maintaining traditional natural dyeing
processes albeit with different preservation techniques. The findings from this research
suggests that product design processes are appropriate for village production and that the
tradition of natural material colour dyes will survive, new colours were created and the
potential for new trade in preserved colour dye products. Substantial databases of useful
relevant information have been compiled and recommendations are made for future
research.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">silk</field><field name="subject">traditional production</field><field name="subject">design techniques</field><field name="subject">Sufficiency Economy</field><field name="subject">textile weaving.</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091216.095908</field></doc><doc><field name="title">IMMUNE EVASION AND DISEASE
MECHANISMS IN ROSS RIVER VIRUS
INFECTION</field><field name="creator">Zaid, Ali</field><field name="description">Ross River virus (RRV) is an Alphavirus distributed throughout Australia. It is transmitted by
mosquitoes and is known to cause moderate to severe disease symptoms in humans. Along with
other alphaviruses such as Sindbis virus and Chikungunya virus, RRV is known to cause arthritic
symptoms, characterised by muscle and joint inflammation. Several investigations have established
the role of macrophage cells and pro-inflammatory host factors in the development of RRV-induced
disease.
In this study, we attempted to determine differences between RRV passaged in mammalian and
mosquito cells. There is strong evidence that arthropod-borne viruses are able to display enhanced
infectivity when passaged into arthropod cell line. We showed that mosquito cell-derived RRV
(mos-RRV) was able to replicate to higher titres than mammalian cell-derived RRV. We also
showed that mos-RRV failed to induce Type I IFN-associated antiviral responses.
The second aim of this study was to investigate the role of TNF-&#6944;a pro-inflammatory cytokine
implicated in arthritic diseases, in the development of RRV disease. We treated RRV-infected
C57BL/6J mice with a commercially available TNF-&#6185;nhibitor drug and monitored disease signs.
We found that the TNF-&#6185;nhibitor does not ameliorate RRV disease (RRVD) symptoms, and that it
does not prevent muscle and joint inflammation. We analysed histological sections of muscle and
joint tissue of Enbrel-treated and untreated, RRV-infected cells. We also determined and compared
host cytokine expression profiles.
Finally, we sought to determine the requirement for natural killer (NK) cells in RRV disease. NK
cells have been detected in the synovium of RRV-infected patients since early studies, but their role
in disease pathogenesis remains unclear. Using a NK-dysfunctional mouse (C57BL/6J-Lystbg), we
showed that mice lacking a functional NK system are more susceptible to RRV disease than wildtype,
C57BL/6J mice. We monitored disease symptoms following RRV infection and assessed
muscle and joint inflammation in Lystbg and C57BL/6J mice.
This thesis examines mechanisms of viral infection and immune evasion employed by RRV, as well
as into the role of host cells and cytokines in RRVD pathogenesis disease mechanisms. We showed
that a functional NK cell system is required for the regulation of RRV-induced muscle and joint
inflammation. Our characterisation of the use of a commercial TNF-&#6185;nhibitor in RRV-induced
disease in mice may provide information on the role of TNF-&#6185;n viral arthritis, and may help
towards developing safe and effective treatment.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">mosquito borne disease</field><field name="subject">RRV</field><field name="subject">tropical viral diseases</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091216.122508</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Implementation of English language skills of Thai students
during the internship in the hospitality service workplaces</field><field name="creator">Boontham Dechabun, Phasuk</field><field name="description">Due to its position as the main source of national income, the tourism and hospitality service industry in Thailand is now highlighted as an area to watch in terms of its value for continued national economic growth. Chiang Rai Rajabhat University (CRU) a university in the tourist area in the North of Thailand, plays a key role in hospitality service education and has a significant influence in the sector because it produces graduates for service in the workforce of this industry. Given the industry's competitive climate, decisions to increase the number of workers, or practitioners, need to take into account the quality of the workers. In this time of globalization, when English is used widely, particularly in the intercultural context ofhospitality service businesses, the quality of English must be seriously considered.
Business English (BE) graduates, as prospective employees, need to be highly
competent in English language skills. This demand for effective English users in
hospitality service workplaces means that there is a need to give serious consideration
to the ability of Thai graduates to become competent users of English in real
workplaces, and to develop an understanding of how they may achieve the high level
of competence required of them.
This study investigates the English language skills Thai students used in intercultural
communication in hospitality service workplaces. The aim was to determine what
essential language skills were used, to explore how these skills were implemented
while giving services to international tourists, and to use the results to reflect on
English for Hospitality Services (EHS) study in order to provide some
recommendations for teaching and learning in those courses.
The project was designed as an ethnographic case study. Multiple research tools were
used, but particularly participatory observations of student workplace interactions,
and semi-structured interviews that included interviews with workplace staff, such as
managers, heads of departments, business owners and on-site supervisors. There were
additional sources of information used, including students' diaries and other documents relevant to internship. The data collected were then examined using both quantitative and qualitative methods. The participants were 15 volunteers and were fourth-year students in the Business English (BE) program at CRU. The case study involved an examination of data collected from ten workplaces in four hospitality service areas.
The observation transcriptions were quantitatively scrutinized for the most essential functional language units used in the hospitality services. The significant findings indicate that the functional language of requests and responding to requests was the most frequently used unit in this hospitality services area. This result confirms previous studies that have found that the functional language of requests, including responding to requests, is the most essential functional pattern in hospitality services. Thanking, offering help/services, and refusing are counted as the second, third and fourth essential units used. However, apologizing and responding to complaints, which are generally considered important in the service area, were very much less frequently used in this study.
There was no evidence that significant breakdown or major problems in
communication occurred during hospitality service procedures examined; however,
the findings suggest that the language proficiency of Thai students was very low in
terms of language accuracy. From the results of the study, it is recommended that
those responsible for EHS teaching and learning give serious consideration to
increasing the level ofcommunicative competence of Thai BE students in terms of
English language skills, and to improving the cultural awareness of graduates who
expect to be involved in intercultural communication in the hospitality services
industry.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Thailand</field><field name="subject">Intercultural communication</field><field name="subject">English language for hospitality services</field><field name="subject">Service encounters</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091218.144909</field></doc><doc><field name="title">MOTIVES OF MATURE-AGE INDIVIDUALS FOR
PARTICIPATING IN COMPETITIVE SPORTS:
A CASE STUDY FOR MASTERS SQUASH</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Heather Diane</field><field name="description">The purpose of this study was threefold. Primarily it was to identify the underlying motivational influences determining why mature age men and women continue playing sport competitively, long after they have reached their peak performance level. Secondly, the study sought to ascertain whether there was a change in specific temperament attributes, such as competitiveness, as Squash players became older, and whether any changes were restricted primarily to the sporting environment, or did changes pervade other areas ofthe individuals' lives. The third purpose of the study was to design a new measurement instrument for use in effectively identifying the primary motivations of mature age squash participants within Australia.
The research study comprised a multi-system methodology which allowed for triangulation analysis of results. It involved both quantitative and qualitative methodological approaches, with four phases of investigation. The first phase focused on the development of a new motivation measurement instrument, titled Masters Sport Motivation Inventory (MSMI). The second phase involved a Pilot study aimed at implementing the MSMI instrument and evaluating it for validity and reliability, and sampled mature-age participants from nine different sports. The outcomes ofthe Pilot study demonstratedvalidityandreliability ofthe MSMI instrument. The third phase ofthe research comprised the main area ofinvestigation, which was to examine the motivations of Masters squash players in Australia. It used the MSMI instrument to obtain relevant data concerning the motivation of this cohort of sports competitors.The fourth phase comprised in-depth personal interviews from Australian Masters squash players. Interviewees had the opportunity to provide a greater insight into the importance of continued sporting participation into their older adult years. The MSMI data for both the Pilot and Main studies was analysed with the SPSS 15 analysis program. It was determined that there were 12 logical and interpretable motivational factors that were relevant to mature-age sports people and Australian Masters squash players. The results of the quantitative approach generally concurred with the outcomes derived from previous research which has examined the motivations of mature-age athletes, which found that health, enjoyment, fitness and competitiveness were highly relevant motives. In addition, this study extended the
outcomes to include other motives viewed as being important to older athletes' sporting aspirations, such as self-awareness, team, aesthetics, skill, stress, recognition, social, and travel,
The interview information was examined in two ways. Firstly, it was examined manually by the researcher. The material obtained during the interview process was classified according to groups of responses with similarities in contextual meaning, and the descriptive response data were calculated in the form ofmanual frequencies and percentages. Winning was the primary motive/outcome. Interview responses were also examined via an analysis program called Leximancer, and results revealed that differences in responses among mature-age squash players based on gender, age-class and ability level were minimal. Interview results indicated that many Masters squash players in Australia were still highly competitive, still very determined to win their matches, and still very focused on their goals and game plans.
The motives derived from the Masters squash players involved in the qualitative approach generally concurred with the outcomes derived from the quantitative approach, thereby adding consistency and outcome strength to the overall research. The opportunity for mature-age squash participants to elaborate on their feelings, sporting goals and motivations to continue playing their chosen sport enabled a greater depth and wealth ofrelevant information to be examined, and revealed a change in motivational emphasis from health and fitness issues to competitive and win-related issues. The results ofthis research as a whole, in relation to the outcomes obtained from the MSMI instrument, as well as from the personal interviews, differs somewhat from the philosophy of Masters sport, whereby it is assumed and promoted that older athletes primarily participate for fun, enjoyment and social opportunities. The results obtained in this research do not necessarily support this view. Many Australian Masters squash players play to win, and they give their all in an effort to achieve this goal and to reap the pleasure of recognition and rewards for doing so.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">sport participation</field><field name="subject">motivation</field><field name="subject">mature-age</field><field name="subject">physical activity</field><field name="identifier">http://erl.canberra.edu.au./public/adt-AUC20091222.155411</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of model fermented fish sausage from New Zealand marine species</field><field name="creator">Khem, Sarim</field><field name="description">Three New Zealand marine species, hoki (Macruronus novaezealandiae), kahawai (Arripis trutta) and trevally (Pseudocaranx dentex) were used to develop model fermented fish sausage.  The formulation comprised fish mince, carbohydrate, minced garlic and salt in a mass ratio of 1 (fish): 0.15: 0.05: 0.03, respectively.  The carbohydrate source was cooked rice or glucose.  (Endogenous lactic acid bacteria (LAB) failed to ferment rice).  Folate was also added to the mixture as a factor.  The mixtures were extruded into 50 mL plastic syringes, where the needle end of the barrel had been excised by lathe.  The lubricated barrel was overfilled to 60 mL, capped with a layer of ParafilmTM and aluminium foil, sealed tightly by rubber band and incubated at 30&#176;C.  Over time the piston was progressively advanced to yield samples for microbiological, physical, and chemical analysis. Over 96 hours an increase in the LAB count was observed with a concomitant decrease in pH.  After fermentation was complete, the samples contained around 8.77 log  cfu LAB g-1 with the pH range from 4.38 to 5.08.  The microbiological and pH behaviour of each species varied between preparations.  Hardness, adhesiveness, springiness and cohesiveness of the treatments increased with fermentation, except for hoki.  The treatments showed different colour characteristics with fermentation.  The light reflectance (L* values) of the trevally and kahawai treatments increased, while the a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values decreased.  Hoki exhibited smaller colour changes except for yellowness, which increased markedly.  Proteolysis, measured colorimetrically by soluble peptide bonds, was greatest for trevally.  Lipid oxidation, measured by the thiobarbituric acid method, was least for hoki, notably the species with the lowest fat content.   Biogenic amines, which are a general quality indicator of fermented products, increased during fermentation.  The trevally treatment generated the highest concentration of amines, but these values were lower than those reported for fermented fish sausage in Southeast Asia.  Notably there were no important difference between folate treatments and those without folate.  The results point to commercial opportunities and further research with New Zealand marine species, especially trevally.  To improve the product quality and to show geographical exclusivity, further research could be done by using starter culture, and a New Zealand staple carbohydrate source such as kumara and potato, and spices and herbs which are commonly used in New Zealand, such as rosemary, thyme and sage or specific to New Zealand, such as horopito.  In addition, sensory studies should also be performed before the products could be tested in the market.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Fermented fish mince</field><field name="subject">Biogenic amine</field><field name="subject">Lactic acid fermentation</field><field name="subject">Trevalley</field><field name="subject">Kahawai</field><field name="subject">Hoki</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/807</field></doc><doc><field name="title">white noise PANORAMA: Process-based Architectural Design</field><field name="creator">Mitsogianni, Vivian</field><field name="description">This PhD by project is an examination of process-based architectural design.

Onshore delivery of higher education has been a major export for many years, and in recent years offshore delivery of vocational education and training has grown to become a major part of this industry. Different Australian educational institutions are involved in delivery of Australian VET programs in a wide range of cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Because of the strong demand for skills in an increasingly interconnected world, this growing industry, which at an international level encompasses a diverse range of institutions, training delivery methods and management and administrative arrangements, is increasingly directing its attention towards globalising its regulatory and training approaches.    The aim of this research is to investigate the process of adapting Training Packages and the Australian Quality Training Framework, the two main instruments of regulation in the Australian skill formation system, for an international audience. This thesis will examine what process of adaptation is involved when the Australian VET approaches are used as a model to develop skills formation overseas. Factors influencing the forms taken by this regulatory system in a global context will be studied through investigating the international activities of various Australian sectors in implementation of VET approaches in non-Australian systems. Two propositions underpin this key question. First is that the Australian VET system is primarily a regulatory system, which means that the export of these regulations needs to be accounted for. Secondly, the Australian VET system has been designed for Australian industrial and cultural conditions and adjustments are necessary in the regulations themselves, host country regulat ory practice, or both for Training Packages to work in these non-Australian cultural contexts.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge transfer</field><field name="subject">Transnational education</field><field name="subject">Vocational education and training</field><field name="subject">VET</field><field name="subject">training packages</field><field name="subject">international business</field><field name="subject">TAFE</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="subject">China</field><field name="subject">Laos</field><field name="subject">Kuwait</field><field name="subject">reform</field><field name="subject">Chongquing</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091218.144230</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Phase-Periodic Quantum Structures and Perturbed Potential Wells</field><field name="creator">Rezaee, Amirabbas</field><field name="description">The restrictions of micro-scale systems are approaching rapidly. In anticipation of this development, nano-scale electronics has become the focus of many researchers and engineers in academia and industry since early 1990s. The basic building blocks of modern integrated circuits have been diodes and transistors with their current-voltage I-V characteristics being of prime significance for the design of complex signal processing and shaping devices and systems. Classical and semi-classical physical principles are no longer powerful enough or even valid to describe the phenomena involved. The application of rich and powerful concepts in quantum theory has become indispensable. These facts have been influential in undertaking this research project.      This research is built upon the determination of the Eigenpairs of one and two dimensional positive differential operators with periodic boundary conditions. The Schr&#246;dinger equation was solved for positive operators in both one and two dimensions. Fourier series were used to express the derivatives as the summation of Fourier terms. This led to a novel approach for the calculation of the eigenmodels of a perturbed potential well. The perturbation can be done via an electric field applied to the potential well.   The research in this thesis includes a thorough understanding of quantum mechanics fundamentals, mastering of different approximation techniques such as the variational technique and results that have been generated and published using the novel techniques.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">nano-scale electronics</field><field name="subject">eigenmodel</field><field name="subject">perturbed potential well</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20091218.160522</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The working relationship between horse and rider during training and competition for equestrian sports</field><field name="creator">Bridgeman, Donald J.</field><field name="description">The working relationship between horses and riders is a unique association requiring cooperation between both to achieve the goals of humans in their selected equestrian sport. This dissertation chose the equestrian sports of eventing and dressage to investigate this working relationship between horse and rider, and its stability across training and competition settings. Consideration was given to psychological, physiological and behavioural factors for the human and horse. The research requiredthe development of a measure to indicate the harmony of the working relationship, which resulted in a rider and observer inventory, and of a physiological indicator of therelationship which became the correlation between the horse and rider heart rate and was called heart rate synchronisation. To examine reactive behavioural factors of the horse a horse Behaviour Check List was created, and to consider possible psychological factors implicated in this behaviour a Horse Temperament Inventory was developed.Anxiety was the psychological factor chosen to assess the rider, and the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory &#8211; 2 and the Emotion and Mood Components of Anxiety &#8211; Questionnaire were used as its different components.It was hypothesized that there would be significant environmental differences between most factors with the competition environment showing evidence of lowerworking relationship scores, higher heart rates, higher rider anxiety, and more reactive horse behaviours. Horse temperament was considered to be a trait and therefore nodifferences were predicted. Negative relationships were hypothesized between the working relationship measures and rider anxiety components, horse temperament andcritical horse behaviours. A positive relationship was hypothesized between rider self confidence and the working relationship. Negative relationships were also predictedbetween rider anxiety, horse temperament and horse behaviour. No specific predictions were made regarding relationships between rider and horse heart rates and the other factors.In Study 1 with five eventing teams, results from Cohen&#8217;s d analyses of differences between means supported some hypotheses. A moderate to large effect size was found for rider&#8217;s somatic anxiety and heart rate being higher in the competition environment, but no significant effects were found for the rider&#8217;s cognitive anxiety and levels of self-confidence across environments. However, contrary to hypotheses, working relationship and the heart rate synchronisation factors had higher scores in thecompetition environment and showed a small and large effect size respectively. The horse&#8217;s temperament was also more positive in the competition environment, with theHorse Temperament Inventory &#8211; Rider (HTI-R) revealing a small effect size and the Horse Temperament Inventory &#8211; Observer (HTI-O) without the rider a large effect size,suggesting that it seems to be identifying a psychological state of the horse rather than the hypothesized temperament traits. The hypothesis regarding the horse and rider&#8217;s heart rate was also accepted as they also increased in the competition environment. The horse&#8217;s maximum heart rate and minimum heart rate showed a moderate effect size and a large effect size was found in the differences of the horse&#8217;s mean heart rate. Therider&#8217;s maximum heart rate and mean heart rate data also showed a large effect size and the rider&#8217;s minimum heart rate means showed a moderate effect size. Due to unforeseencircumstances and the low number of participants, the hypotheses could not be evaluated using inferential statistics. However, the patterns of the findings led to some modifications of methods and the selection of another equestrian sport for Study 2.The findings from Study 2 with thirty dressage teams indicate the working relationship between horse and rider was stable across environments during a dressagetest. The heart rate synchronisation analysis was able to identify significant relationships between most horse and rider teams during a dressage test in both the training and competition environments. At a group level the correlation between the horse and rider heart rates displayed a significant positive relationship in the training environment, but not in the competition environment. A t-test analysis found stabilityof the horse&#8217;s temperament across environments, suggesting that the Horse Temperament Inventory is measuring temperament traits. Also the rider&#8217;s somatic anxiety showed a significant increase in the competition environment, which was also reflected in the rider&#8217;s emotional experience of this anxiety. Unexpectedly the rider&#8217;s self-confidence was also significantly higher in the competition environment. However, no predicted associations were found between working relationship scores and heart rate synchronisation, or between these measures and horse and rider factors.The relationship between reactive horse misbehaviours and rider anxiety, and the team&#8217;s working relationship was analysed. A significant association was found between each of the rider&#8217;s and judge&#8217;s ratings of the working relationship and heart rate synchronisation with the horse&#8217;s misbehaviour scores in the competitionenvironment. The rider&#8217;s somatic anxiety also showed a significant association with the horse&#8217;s misbehaviour in both the training and competition environments. Significantrelationships were also found between horse misbehaviour and performance in both training and competition environments. To extend this investigation further adiscriminant function analysis was conducted to determine if the riders with levels of high and low cognitive and somatic anxiety could be categorised on the basis of horsetemperament. It revealed that riders with high and low levels of somatic anxiety could be categorised on the basis of the horse&#8217;s temperament score, whereas riders with high and low levels of cognitive anxiety could be classified on the basis of the horse&#8217;s heart rate means in the competition environment.Overall, the dissertation has significant methodological, conceptual and practical outcomes. It demonstrates possible self report, observational and physiologicalindicators to assess the horse-rider working relationship, and a reliable measure of horse temperament. It also addresses several speculations, assumptions and anecdotalreferences in the literature about the interactive association between horse and rider. Findings here point to significant associations between horse and rider psychology and physiology, and patterns of relationships that may indicate some relevance to theworking relationship, and ultimately performance.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">horses;</field><field name="subject">riders;</field><field name="subject">relationship;</field><field name="subject">training;</field><field name="subject">competition;</field><field name="subject">equestrian</field><field name="subject">events</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006533/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Quantifying thresholds for native vegetation to salinity and waterlogging for the design of direct conservation approaches</field><field name="creator">Horsnell, Tara Kathleen</field><field name="description">A field-based project was undertaken to develop and test a mechanism which would allow for the correlation of the health of vegetation surrounding playa lakes in south-west Australia with the natural variation in salinity and waterlogging that occurs spatially and temporally in natural systems. The study was designed to determine threshold ranges of vegetation communities using moderately extensive data over short temporal periods which will guide the design of potential engineering solutions that manipulate hydrological regimes to ultimately conserve and protect native vegetation. A pair of playa lake ecosystems, surrounded by primary production land, was modelled with hydro-geological data collected from March 2006 to March 2007. The data was used to determine the hydroperiods of vegetation communities fringing playa lakes and provide insight into the areas and species that are most affected by extreme rainfall events which are hypothesised to have a significant, rapid deleterious effect on the ecosystems. The methodology was multi-faceted and included;  a detailed topographical survey;  vegetation surveys;  hydrological and hydro-geological monitoring over a 12 month period. 4 The hydro-geological data and vegetation data was linked with the topographical survey at a high resolution for spatial analysis in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to determine the degree of waterlogging experienced by vegetation communities over the monitoring period. The study has found that the spatial and temporal variability of hydroperiods has been reduced by rising groundwater levels, a result of extensive clearing of native vegetation. Consequently populations are becoming extinct locally resulting in a shift in community composition. Extreme summer rainfall events also have a significant impact on the health of vegetation communities by increasing the duration of waterlogging over an annual cycle and in some areas expanding the littoral zone. Vegetation is most degraded at lower positions in the landscape where communities are becoming less diverse and dominated by salt tolerant halophytic species as a result of altered hydrological regimes. Some species appear to be able to tolerate groundwater depths of less than 2.0 m from the surface, however there are thresholds related to the duration at which groundwater is maintained at this depth. Potential engineering solutions include groundwater pumping and diverting water through drains to maintain sustainable hydroperiods for vegetation in areas with conservation value. The effectiveness and efficiency of the engineering solutions can be maximised by quantifying thresholds for vegetation that include sustainable durations of waterlogging. The study has quantified tolerance ranges to salinity and waterlogging with data collected over 12 months but species may be experiencing a transition period where they have 5 sustained irreversible damage that will result in their eventual mortality. With long-term monitoring, the methodology developed and tested in the study can be used to quantify the long-term tolerance ranges that are important for the application of conservation approaches that include engineering solutions.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Drainage -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Plant-water relationships -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Soil salinization -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Vegetation management -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging (Soils) -- Western Australia -- South-West</field><field name="subject">Vegetation</field><field name="subject">Salinity</field><field name="subject">Waterlogging</field><field name="subject">Condition</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0082</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of directed gp130-mediated signalling in bleomycin-induced murine pulmonary fibrosis</field><field name="creator">O'Donoghue, Robert Joseph James</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Fibrosis is a feature of many pulmonary conditions, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is characterised by the accumulation of fibroblasts/myofibroblasts and excessive deposition of collagen. IPF is a disease of unknown aetiology that is unresponsive to current therapy and is typically fatal. The inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is elevated in patients with IPF and recent studies have shown that IL-6-induced signalling is altered in lung fibroblasts from patients with IPF. IL-6 belongs to the gp130 cytokine family, which is a group of ten structurally related cytokines, that all require the membrane bound glycoprotein gp130 to activate intracellular signalling pathways. Gp130 activates intracellular signalling through the Shp2-ERK1/2 and STAT1/3 pathways to mediate cellular activities. This thesis tests the hypothesis that gp130-mediated signalling is dysregulated in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis. To address this hypothesis, I assessed the role of gp130-mediated signalling in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. This thesis utilised two novel gp130 mutant mice strains with directed and enhanced gp130-mediated Shp2-ERK1/2 (gp130&#191;STAT/&#191;STAT) or STAT1/3 (gp130757F/757F) signalling. I observed complete protection from fibrosis in gp130&#191;STAT/&#191;STAT mice up to 60 days after bleomycin treatment and profound fibrosis in gp130757F/757F mice compared to wt controls. The enhanced fibrosis observed in gp130757F/757F mice was diminished by monoallelic deletion of STAT3 (gp130757F/757F;STAT3+/-), identifying gp130-STAT3 signalling as a novel promoter of lung fibrosis. ... In addition, IL-6/11 activation of gp130-mediated signalling modulated transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#223;-induced effects on adult fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation. Interaction between IL-6/11 and TGF-&#223;1 on fibroblast proliferation was dependent on both the gp130-ERK1/2 and gp130-STAT1/3 pathways. Loss of either pathway abrogated the effects of IL-6 and IL-11 on TGF-&#223;1- 4 induced fibroblast proliferation. However, it was clear that gp130-STAT3 signalling inhibited TGF-&#223;1-induced myofibroblast differentiation of primary lung fibroblasts. The inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation was associated with gp130-STAT3 dependent inhibition of TGF-&#223;1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation. These results indicate that IL-6 and IL-11 promote myofibroblastic differentiation of lung fibroblasts, while gp130-STAT3 signalling inhibits TGF-&#223;1-induced Smad3 phosphorylation and myofibroblastic differentiation of lung fibroblasts While the pathogenesis of IPF is unknown, it is believed that excessive collagen deposition, aberrant fibroblast behaviour and an inflammatory response are critical to the progression of this disease. It has been shown here that IL-6 family cytokines mediate the development and progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis by increasing collagen synthesis, fibroblast proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation and inflammation through gp130-STAT3 signalling. This thesis has demonstrated that differential activation of cytoplasmic signalling pathways by a membrane bound receptor can have a profound effect on pulmonary responses to injury. Furthermore, this thesis is the first study to identify the gp130-STAT3 pathway as a therapeutic target in the treatment of IPF.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Pulmonary fibrosis -- Etiology</field><field name="subject">Pulmonary fibrosis -- Animal models</field><field name="subject">Interleukin-6</field><field name="subject">Gp130</field><field name="subject">Interleukin-6</field><field name="subject">Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis</field><field name="subject">Stat 3</field><field name="subject">Lung disease</field><field name="subject">Collagen</field><field name="subject">Fibrosis</field><field name="subject">TGF-&#223;</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0111</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of inhibition and written emotional disclosure in sport injury rehabilitation</field><field name="creator">Mankad, Aditi</field><field name="description">A series of four studies examined the emotional climate of elite sport, and tested the utility of an emotional disclosure intervention during sport injury rehabilitation. Overall, results from the investigations indicated that athletes' usual coping mechanism during injury rehabilitation was to inhibit and suppress felt emotions, while displaying mock emotions that were considered acceptable within their sport climate. Pennebaker's (1989) written disclosure paradigm was shown to address athletes' emotionally inhibitive coping style and encourage psychological and physical well-being. It was found to be a viable alternative to psychotherapy within the sport injury context. Athletes showed improvements in stress and mood disturbance, and fewer grief responses towards their injury. Affective and cognitive linguistic markers also showed changes during the 3-day intervention period, leading to the informed assumption that there was a likely association between changes in athletes' psychological responses to injury post-intervention and changes among the linguistic markers of interest. Results were discussed in the context of the broader sport psychology of injury research and limitations of the present investigations were discussed.

While a variety of methods are available to facilitate comparison between recovered and control samples, the use of a specific analytical method depends upon both the physical and chemical nature of the material itself and the material to which it is to be compared. Elemental analysis of evidentiary material is one such method of sample comparison and has been extensively applied to this purpose following the introduction of neutron activation analysis in the early 1960s. However, over the last 15 years, another instrumental technique has taken centre stage in the analytical armoury of the forensic scientist: laser ablation&#150;inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The modification and adaptation of this technique, to a point where it is possible to distinguish between glass materials produced only hours apart on the same production line, is detailed in this thesis. Additional protocols have also been developed for the analysis of fibreglass and plastic crime scene debris. Finally, a method for quantification of elemental concentrations in headlamp plastics has also been developed to facilitate inter-comparison of data between both different analytical techniques and different laboratories. Glass material is one of the most common varieties of trace evidence and the forensic examination of glass traditionally involves the determination of its refractive index (RI). ...  The analytical protocol involves the analysis of 46 analytes on material comprising the exterior surface of the lens. Using this data, it was found that although minor variations in elemental composition exist within a single headlamp lens, discrimination between lenses produced from a single manufacturing plant over a short period of time could still be achieved. Discrimination between all headlamp lenses, with the exception of some lenses produced on the same day, could be facilitated using the analytical protocol developed. Furthermore, an interpretational protocol has been developed that has successfully classified all unknown headlamp lens samples investigated in this study, within the discrimination limits of the analytical method. The semi-quantitative analysis of glass and plastic samples has also been examined using LA-ICP-MS. The concentrations of 16 analytes in container and float glass samples were determined. However, the levels of discrimination afforded by the semi-quantitative data were inferior to those achieved using qualitative data. Finally, a series of plastic-based standards, containing 25 analytes of known concentrations, was produced. Using these standards, relative concentrations of the study analytes were determined in polycarbonate headlamp lenses. Interpretation of the data produced made it possible to discriminate between all study samples.

The teeth, however, also have other practical forensic applications. Teeth exposed to thermal stress have the potential to not only aid in identification but also in understanding the circumstances surrounding the fire. Previous investigations have drawn conclusions that if a fire flares up suddenly and intensively, the teeth burst and enamel is lost. If the blaze commences gently and burns slowly, then the first observable morphologic change is the colour. The teeth subsequently are difficult to handle, thus changes in teeth can indicate the history of exposure to thermal conditions. Children are twice as likely to become victims of house fire because of an inability to safely evacuate from areas of danger. The literature demonstrates, however, that research on the effects of incineration on teeth is mostly restricted to the permanent teeth. The apparent lack of knowledge on the effects of incineration on deciduous teeth thus necessitates further research in this area. This research project primarily aims at understanding the effect of extreme temperatures on deciduous teeth. It also aims to relate colour changes that occur post heating with fragility to aid in proper handling of samples in a forensic scenario and to determine the possibility of identifying incineration temperature based on tooth condition. The samples analysed composed of 90 deciduous teeth (45 molars and 45 anteriors) extracted as a part of clinical treatment were used for the study. The project involved exposing extracted deciduous teeth to temperatures ranging from 100&#176;C to 1100&#176;C for 30 minutes using a laboratory Gallenkamp oven. Unheated deciduous teeth were used as controls for the project. Post-incineration the teeth were then analysed under a stereomicroscope and SEM for morphological changes. A colorimetric analysis was also undertaken to evaluate the colour changes induced in the primary teeth due to the thermal stress. It was found that it was possible to identify the incineration temperature based on the tooth condition when the colour changes, stereomicroscopic findings and SEM images were utilised collectively. It was also concluded that the thermally induced changes observed in primary teeth occur at lower temperatures in comparison to the permanent teeth. It was also established that post-incineration deciduous teeth are fragile and show a tendency to fragment after minimal exposure to thermal stress as compared to the permanent teeth. Moreover enamel and dentin remained identifiable in primary teeth even after exposure to 1100&#176;C for 30 minutes while cementum lost its structural morphology at 900&#176;C.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Dental jurisprudence</field><field name="subject">Deciduous teeth -- Effect of heat on</field><field name="subject">Dental cementum -- Effect of high temperatures on</field><field name="subject">Dental enamel -- Effect of high temperatures on</field><field name="subject">Dentin -- Effect of high temperatures on</field><field name="subject">Deciduous dentition</field><field name="subject">Forensic odontology</field><field name="subject">Incineration</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0170</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Residue composition influences nutrient release from crop residues</field><field name="creator">Collins, Shane</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] A greater adoption of stubble retention, minimum-till and no-till farming practices for the purposes of conserving soil, water and fertility requires a greater understanding of the complexity of physical and chemical interactions between the soil and crop residues. There is currently insufficient knowledge to allow reliable predictions of the effects of different residue types in different environments on soil fertility and crop growth, owing to the many residue characteristics and environmental interactions that have been shown to affect decomposition or nutrient release. The role of fibre and nutrient composition in nutrient release from crop residues, and implications for residue management techniques, were studied. Canola, lupin and field pea residues, obtained from farmland in Meckering and Northam, Western Australia, were separated into upper and basal stems, leaves, and siliques or pods. This was done to provide materials with a wide range of chemical and physical characteristics, and also allowed consideration of differential residue management of plant organs, such as comparing harvested canola siliques and retained canola stubble. Pre-treatment by chopping and/or humidification was applied to residues to provide some information about the processes of nutrient release. Residues were subjected to simulated rainfall to assess nutrient leaching from plant material, and placed on soil in pots in constant-temperature glasshouse conditions to assess decomposition. Amounts and rates of change of residue fibre and nutrients were determined throughout leaching and decomposition. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis was used to assess the location of diffusible ions in air-dried residues and the effects of humidification on nutrient positioning and release. ... However, the release of calcium and magnesium depended on the decomposition of the more recalcitrant components such as cellulose and lignin, as supported by microscopy results showing changes in nutrient distribution following humidification. The proportionality of amounts of calcium and magnesium leached and released during decomposition is likely to suggest a similarity of chemical form more than similarity of function or position of the two elements. Management of crop residues for maximising and optimising the timing of release of different nutrients will need to take into account the placement of different plant types and parts, particle sizes distribution and pre-treatment of material to efficiently manage short- and long-term soil fertility to sustain crops, particularly on degraded soils. Significant nutrient release of potassium, sulphur and magnesium from crop residues can be achieved from surface placement, with the release of potassium and sulphur managed by modifying residue particle size through appropriate harvesting, ploughing or sowing implement selection. High nutrient uptake crops and plant parts &#150;where they can be economically viable to grow or separated by the harvesting technique &#150; are particularly valuable as sources of nutrients and soil organic matter.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Crop residue management -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Soil fertility -- Research -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant nutrients -- Leaching -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships</field><field name="subject">Crops and soils</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0171</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The moral possibilities of mass art</field><field name="creator">D'Olimpio, Lauralin</field><field name="description">This Thesis critically examines the moral possibilities of mass art.

Due to its favourable properties as an already established (but non-biodegradable) biomaterial, PHEMA is an interesting candidate for use as a material for scaffolds in tissue engineering. A tenant of tissue engineering scaffolds is obtaining the appropriate porous morphology to allow for successful cellular attachment and support. PHEMA hydrogels exhibit varied morphological features, which range from non-porous (homogeneous) to macroporous (heterogeneous) and can be readily obtained by fine-tuning the polymerisation conditions. A desirable feature for matrices that are to be used as tissue supports is the ability to biodegrade in a biological environment. This thesis describes the preparation and enzymatic biodegradation behaviour of novel porous PHEMA hydrogels that have been crosslinked with biodegradable peptide-based crosslinking agents. Peptide-based crosslinking agents were designed to contain two terminal polymerisable groups flanking an internal biodegradable backbone. This backbone was specifically designed to be targeted by the proteolytic enzyme papain. The general design template allowed for the development of a synthetic methodology that was readily implemented for the production of a range of olefin-peptide conjugates. A suite of olefin-peptide conjugates of general structure I were synthesised, characterised and further tested with papain to determine their biodegradation properties. ... The second strategy for producing bioresorbable degradation fragments involved the incorporation of the highly hydrophilic comonomer, poly(ethylene glycol) PEG into the PHEMA backbone. The addition of PEG to PHEMA resulted in the formation of homogeneous hydrogels that had an improved hydrophilicity compared to their heterogeneous PHEMA counterparts. The synthetic conditions for the preparation of PHEMA and PHEMA-co-PEG hydrogels by photoinitiated polymerisation were thoroughly investigated. It was found that the pore morphology and general properties (non-porous to macroporous) of these hydrogels could be controlled by the appropriate choice of polymerisation conditions. The hydrogels were characterised by scanning electron microscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. The peptide-based crosslinking agents were successfully co-polymerised with the HEMA and PEGMA via photoinitiated polymerisation to provide a range of PHEMA and PHEMA-co-PEG hydrogels that displayed both homogeneous and heterogeneous hydrogel properties. The final crosslinked hydrogels were characterised by scanning electron microscopy and were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis. The PHEMA-peptide conjugate hydrogels proved to be biodegradable, with degradation behaviour dependent on the hydrogel formulation and the length of the peptide-based crosslinking agent.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Biodegradation</field><field name="subject">Biomedical materials</field><field name="subject">Colloids in medicine</field><field name="subject">Gels (Pharmacy)</field><field name="subject">Polymers -- Biodegradation</field><field name="subject">Polymers in medicine</field><field name="subject">Tissue engineering</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0173</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Werewolves and women with whiskers : figures of estrangement in early modern English drama and culture</field><field name="creator">Hirsch, Brett Daniel</field><field name="description">Each chapter of Werewolves and Women with Whiskers: Figures of Estrangement in Early Modern English Drama and Culture explores a particular figure of fascination and fear in the early modern English imagination: in one it is owls, in another bearded women, in a third werewolves, and in yet another Jews. Drawing on instances from drama and other cultural forms, this thesis seeks to examine each of these phenomena in terms of their estrangement. There is a symbolic appositeness in each of these figures, whether in estranged and estranging minority groups, such as Catholics, Jesuits, Jews, Puritans, Italians, the Irish, and the Scots; or in transgressive behaviours, such as cross-dressing and gender trouble, infidelity and apostasy, intemperate passion and unnatural desire. Essentially unfixed and unstable, these emblematic figures are indicative of cultural uncertainty and therefore are easily adapted to suit changing political, religious, and social climates. However, adaptability and fluidity come at a price, since figures of difference have an uncomfortable way of transforming themselves into figures of resemblance. Thus, this thesis argues, each of these figures&#151;owls, bearded women, werewolves, Jews&#151;occupies an undefined and undefinable space on the precarious boundary between the usual and the unusual, between the strange and the strangely familiar, and, most strangely and paradoxically of all, between us and them.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alienation (Social psychology) in literature</field><field name="subject">English drama -- Early modern and Elizabethan, 1500-1600 -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">English drama -- 17th century -- History and criticism</field><field name="subject">Literature and society -- England -- History -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">England -- Social life and customs -- 17th century</field><field name="subject">Early modern England</field><field name="subject">Drama</field><field name="subject">Estrangement</field><field name="subject">Literary history</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0175</field></doc><doc><field name="title">At the borders of belonging : representing cultural citizenship in Australia, 1973-1984</field><field name="creator">Anderson, Zoe Melantha Helen</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis offers a re-contextualisation of multiculturalism and immigration in Australia in the 1970s and 80s in relation to crucial and progressive shifts in gender and sexuality. It provides new ways of examining issues of belonging and cultural citizenship in this field of inquiry, within an Australian context. The thesis explores the role sexuality played in creating a framework through which anxieties about immigration and multiculturalism manifested. It considers how debates about gender and sexuality provided fuel to concerns about ethnic diversity and breaches of the 'cultural' borders of Australia. I have chosen three significant historical moments in which anxieties around events relating to immigration/multiculturalism were most heightened: these are the beginning of the 'official' policy of multiculturalism in Australia in 1973; the arrival of large numbers of Vietnamese refugees as a consequence of the Vietnam War in 1979; and 1984, a year in which the furore over the alleged 'Asianisation' of Australia reached a peak. In these years, multiple and recurring representations served to recreate norms as applicable to the white heterosexual family, not only as a commentary and prescriptive device for migrants, but as a means of reinforcing 'Australianness' itself. A focus on the body as a border/site of belonging and in turn, crucially, its relationship to the heterosexual nuclear family as a marker of 'cultural citizenship', lies at the heart of this exploration. Normative ideas of gender and sexuality, I demonstrate, were integral in informing the ambivalence about multiculturalism and ethnic diversity in Australia. Indeed, for each of these years I examine how the discourses of gender and sexuality, evident for example in parliamentary debates such as that relating to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, were intricately tied to ongoing concerns regarding growing non-white ethnicity in Australia, and indeed, enabled it. ... In pursuing this contribution, the work draws critically upon recent innovative interdisciplinary scholarship in the field of sexuality and immigration, and draws upon a broad range of sources to inform a comprehensive and complex examination of these issues. Sources employed include the major newspapers and periodicals of the time, Parliamentary debates from the Commonwealth House of Representatives, Parliamentary Committee findings and publications, speeches and polemics, and relevant legislation. This inquiry is an interrogation of a key methodological question: can sexuality, in its workings through ethnicity and 'race', be used as a primary tool of analysis in discussing how whiteness and 'Australianness' reconfigured itself through normative heteropatriarchy in an era that claimed to champion and celebrate difference? How and why did ambiguities concerning 'Australianness' prevail, concurrent with progressive and generally politically benign periods of Australian multiculturalism? The thesis argues that sexuality &#150; through the construction of the 'good white hetero-patriarchal family' &#150; both informed, and enabled, the endurance of anxieties around non-white ethnicity in Australia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Citizenship -- Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Cultural pluralism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Immigrants -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Multiculturalism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Nationalism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Emigration and immigration -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australia -- History -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Social conditions -- 20th century</field><field name="subject">Australian identity</field><field name="subject">Immigration</field><field name="subject">Ethnicity</field><field name="subject">Sexuality and gender</field><field name="subject">Cultural citizenship</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0176</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Representations of the secular : neutrality, spirituality and mourning in Australia and Canadian cultural politics</field><field name="creator">Sunderland, Sophie Monica May</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] This thesis explores the ways in which 'the secular' is represented in contemporary Australian participatory art, screen, and print cultures. Secularisms are currently the subject of analysis in a broad range of disciplines within the humanities, and this thesis intervenes upon the field by focusing on the cultural politics of representations of embodied, spatialized secularisms. The secular is commonly defined in opposition to the 'religious,' and can also be extrapolated to the division of public and private spaces. Thus, by considering the occlusions and violences inherent in the ways bodies negotiate and are constructed through space, this thesis argues for the fluidity and porosity of these oppositions. By drawing from Janet Jakobsen and Ann Pellegrini's notion of secularisms, understood as specific, situated narratives of the secular, as well as Talal Asad's and William E. Connolly's conceptions of the secular, this thesis identifies 'neutrality' and 'spirituality' as two key narratives of the secular around which questions of language, embodiment, affect, and subjectivity are set in motion. Here, a regime of representation that constructs 'religious' subjects as outsiders to an imagined Australian national identity is critiqued and reconsidered in terms of anxieties about remembering and living with difference and loss. Rather than defining 'the secular,' this thesis seeks to maintain focus on the context and contingencies of enunciation. Thus, firstly the conflation of secularism with 'neutrality' and 'objectivity' is explored through a discussion of 'defining' secularisms, alongside critique of representations of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). By identifying the ways in which this 'everyday' text signals exclusions through the privileging of British Protestant Christianity in its contents, colonial history and usage, I consider how 'neutrality' is made contextually and contingently.  ... . Here, secular mourning is a suggestive concept that foregrounds 'affective economies' of loss, grief, and mourning alongside openness to the ways in which identity is made and lived relationally, and differently. Given that the representations of Australian secularisms I identify are made by locating 'the religious' elsewhere, this thesis reflects upon this process by including a contingent comparative study of representations of Canadian secularisms.

Since the first Australian species were described in the early twentieth century, and the family was erected in 1944, the taxonomic status and phylogenetic placement of the Micropholcommatidae have been the subject of ongoing debate. Various phylogenetic hypotheses have been proposed for the family, but these hypotheses have never been tested with a robust phylogenetic analysis &#150; a problem compounded by the inadequate state and confusing history of micropholcommatid taxonomy. To address the many gaps in our understanding of micropholcommatid interrelationships, this thesis will present a comprehensive systematic treatment of the family. Using a combination of molecular phylogenetic, morphological cladistic and taxonomic methods, micropholcommatid diversity is documented and tested at multiple systematic levels, with an alpha-taxonomic and biogeographic focus on the diverse Australian fauna. The taxonomic contribution is substantial throughout, with one new family, two new subfamilies, one new tribe, 14 new genera and 37 new species described. A combined molecular phylogenetic study is presented in Chapter 2, as a 'first pass' exploration of the monophyly, limits and phylogenetic position of the family Micropholcommatidae. The analyses incorporated 50 ingroup spider species, including 23 micropholcommatid taxa, with nucleotide sequences obtained from two nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (18S and 28S).   ...The new subfamily Gigiellinae is also described for two enigmatic species in the newly-described genus Gigiella, known only from the temperate Nothofagus rainforests of south-eastern Australia and southern Chile. As a final contribution to micropholcommatid taxonomy, and as an extension to the cladistic analyses presented in Chapter 5, the new spider family Teutoniellidae is proposed in Chapter 6 for three genera from South America, South Africa and Australia. Teutoniellid monophyly is evidenced by at least two unambiguous synapomorphies, and the morphology of the family is described in relation to other symphytognathidan and EbCY spider taxa. The nominate genus Teutoniella is redescribed to include three species from South America, along with an additional new species from Tasmania. Two new teutoniellid genera are also described, each for a single new species from South Africa: Inflaticrus ansieae is described from the Langeberg Range, east of Cape Town; and Woldius hennigi is described from near Pietermaritzburg, north-west of Durban. In summary, this thesis provides a taxonomic and phylogenetic framework for all future research on micropholcommatid spiders. It presents new data on the phylogeny, phylogenetic position, composition, biogeography, molecular evolution and natural history of a previously poorly-known group of spiders, and highlights a number of remaining gaps in our knowledge of micropholcommatid and araneoid systematics.

The wireless channel conditions in industrial environments are harsher as a result of multipath propagation of radio signals within an environment where the mechanics of the surrounding industrial activities often lead to severe small-scale fading effects. The design of network protocols to function in such an environment needs to provide a robust communication platform for the wireless sensor nodes, while optimizing the utilization of the limited node resources available. As existing general MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks do not work well under harsh channel conditions, we address this problem in this thesis by proposing a medium access control (MAC) protocol framework for wireless sensor networks in industrial environments. To describe the impact of an automated industrial site on small-scale fading effects in an industrial indoor wireless network, we use a site-specific ray-tracer for predicting signal propagation based on building blue prints to simulate the signal propagation paths through an industrial site with periodically moving objects. We found that in a fully automated industrial site, the periodic movements of objects with constant velocities result in an approximately periodic distribution of fading periods in the channel. Based on this finding, we propose a link state dependent TDMA-based MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks designed for automated industrial applications.  ...  This technique also conserves energy and maximizes packet integrity as the sensor nodes avoid performing network activities when the channel is sampled to be affected by fading. As a measure for fault-tolerance, we also propose a dynamic link reconstruction technique that allows sensor nodes to reconstruct new parent links when their present links are severely affected by fading. MAC protocols that adopt active buffering in fading-affected channels suffer bufferoverflow and latency issues as a result of the postponement of scheduled transmissions during periods when the channel is in a fade. Consequently, time-sensitive data packets that may contain critical information may miss their deadlines in a severely affected fading channel. Hence, we propose a general fading-aware data management (FADE) MAC protocol extension that uses buffer nodes to offload the memory buffer off sensor nodes in the network and prioritizes traffic based on a simple proposed priority scheme. The FADE extension provides a balance balance between minimum end-to-end latency for critical event reporting, high packet delivery guarantee, low energy consumption, and minimum buffer requirements on the sensor nodes. In summary, this thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of all our proposed network protocols that are combined as a framework for wireless sensor networks in industrial environments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Computer network protocols</field><field name="subject">Wireless communication systems</field><field name="subject">Sensor networks</field><field name="subject">Industrial environment</field><field name="subject">MAC protocol</field><field name="subject">Fading</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0179</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Analysis of the novel Lyn-associated cytoskeletal modular protein, LACM</field><field name="creator">McCarthy, David James</field><field name="description">A yeast-two hybrid screen with Lyn identified a novel 130 kDa multidomain protein with a 36% identity to Actin Filament Associated Protein (AFAP) 110 and similar domains, including PH domains, potential sites of tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation, a leucine-zipper domain, a potential actin binding site and multimerization site. AFAP110 has been shown to have a role in modulating actin filament integrity and induce lamellipodia formation, and is known to interact with Src family kinases. The aim of this thesis was to characterize this novel protein named Lyn-Associated Cytoskeletal Modulator (LACM) and determine any molecular interactions in order to attempt to elucidate a role for the protein in cell signaling through Lyn. LACM is encoded by a gene consisting of 18 exons and is located on human chromosome 5q33.1 and mouse chromosome 18 E1. LACM protein is expressed through a number of cell types including the R11 erythroid cell line, and mouse tissues including brain, lung, heart and embryos. LACM was shown to multimerize, and subcellular localization of the protein was observed to concentrate around the cell membrane at sites of filamentous actin in filopodia, lamellipodia and stress fibres. The carboxy-terminus of LACM was observed to localize the protein to sites at the cell membrane and through the cytoplasm. Removal of this terminal region resulted in all LACM protein localizing to the nucleus in punctuate spots. LACM protein was observed in heart muscle and potentially has a role at sites of nerve junctions on cardiac myocytes. LACM was shown to interact with the SH3 domain of Lyn at a polyproline motif on LACM.

Mitochondria in plants are also known to carry out a variety of other important biochemical processes within the cell, including the anaplerotic function of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, one-carbon metabolism and portions of photorespiration. Dynamics of the mitochondrial proteome in plants underlies fundamental differences in the roles of these organelles under different developmental and environmental conditions. A quantitative comparative proteomic approach was carried out to analyze mitochondria isolated from non-photosynthetic models, cell culture and root, and compared them to mitochondria isolated from photosynthetic shoots. The glycinedependent respiration rate and the protein abundance of the photorespiratory apparatus was found to be higher in shoot than cell culture and root mitochondria. Also, there were major differences in the abundance and/or activities of enzymes in the TCA cycle between the three systems examined. The metabolic pathways that relied on the supply of intermediates from TCA cycle and photorespiration were also altered, namely cysteine, formate and one-carbon metabolism, as well as amino acid metabolism focused on 2-oxoglutarate generation, and branched-chain amino acids degradation. To further provide insight into the extent of mitochondrial heterogeneity in plants, mitochondria isolated from six organ/cell types, leaf, root, cell culture, flower, stem and silique were analyzed. Of the 251 protein spots on a 2D-gel of the mitochondrial soluble/matrix fraction, the abundance of 213 spots were significantly varied between different samples. Identification of these spots revealed a non-redundant set of 79 proteins which were differentially expressed between organ/cell types. ... Importantly, posttranslational modifications played a significant role in the dynamics of the leaf mitochondrial proteome during the diurnal cycle. Overall, these findings indicated that the mitochondrial proteome is dynamic in order to fulfil different functional and physiological requirements in response to organspecific growth and changes in the external environments. These results also indicated that the majority of the changes in the mitochondrial proteome occurred in the matrix and suggested differences in substrate choice/availability in various plant organs and during the diurnal cycle. Further, these analyses demonstrate that, while mitochondrial proteins are regulated transcriptionally by the nucleus, post-transcriptional regulation and/or post-translational modifications play a vital role in modulating the activation state and/or regulation of proteins in key biochemical pathways in plant mitochondria. The integration of proteomics data with respiratory measurements, enzyme assays and transcript datasets will allow the identification of organ-enhanced and/or light/darkresponsive metabolic pathways as well as providing potential targets for reverse genetic approaches for further functional analysis of plant mitochondria.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Plant mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Plant molecular biology</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Metabolism</field><field name="subject">Plants -- Respiration</field><field name="subject">Plant mitochondria</field><field name="subject">Proteomics</field><field name="subject">Metabolic networks</field><field name="subject">Organelle dynamics and heterogeneity</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0181</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The impact of a strategic alliance on customer perceived value</field><field name="creator">Smith, Renate</field><field name="description">The formation of alliances has become a key strategy for businesses wishing to grow.

Surprisingly little research has examined the impact such alliances have on the customer, so we do not know if these alliances result in tangible benefits for customers that can be used to improve the outcomes of the alliance.

The motivation for the study was the claim made by some academics that historically Education has been marginalised in certain universities in the UK, the USA and Australia, and that this marginalisation was intensified by a negative attitude towards its association with teacher preparation. Very little evidence, however, has been put forward to support this claim, thus highlighting a major neglected area of research. This thesis is a response to such neglect in relation to the situation in one state in Australia. The focus of the thesis is on the 'preactive curriculum' as represented in the plans and syllabi that outline what was included in programs and courses. An 'internal' analysis of relevant documents was conducted along with an 'external' analysis which considered the broader social, economic and political context. It was recognised that a study of the 'interactive curriculum' also needs to be conducted to gain insights into how the 'preactive curriculum' was mediated by lecturers and students. From the outset, however, it was deemed that this would constitute a further major study in itself.  ... The most prominent were the 'academic', 'integrated', 'vocational', 'technical', 'pragmatic' and 'professional' orientations. The content of Education at the five universities also varied. Such variation offered breadth of opportunity for students. It also meant that, collectively, the universities served the needs of the State and their students by providing relevant and flexible curricula beyond what would have been possible in a 'one size fits all' model. Furthermore the claim that there was tension regarding the inclusion of 'Education' as an area of study within Australian universities generally, is not upheld for the Western Australian context. While this thesis contributes to an understanding of how, historically, Education as an area of study has been constructed in one State in Australia, much further research remains to be done in this field of curriculum history. In particular, future research could focus on the way in which Education, along with other areas of university study, have been constructed in the other states of Australia and overseas. The identification of areas of contestation and omissions from courses are also worthy of consideration. Finegrained studies of this nature could collectively make an important contribution to the understanding of the history of developments in the university curriculum at a macro level. Such work would, in the fullness of time, contribute to new understandings about institutionalised learning at tertiary level and provide historical insights to inform current practice as universities continue to try to find their way in a global society.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">University of Western Australia -- Curricula -- History</field><field name="subject">University of Western Australia. -- Faculty of Education -- History</field><field name="subject">Teachers -- Training of -- Western Australia  -- History</field><field name="subject">Education -- Study and teaching -- Western Australia -- History</field><field name="subject">Discipline of history</field><field name="subject">History</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0183</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Waves of change : economic development and social wellbeing in Cardwell, North Queensland, Australia</field><field name="creator">Reif, Alison</field><field name="description">This thesis is an anthropological study of local understandings of economic development in a small regional town in far North Queensland, Australia. How do preferences regarding lifestyle and social wellbeing impact on those living in the community? The study takes a particular interest in the aspirations, values and choices of the residents and their desires for the future and the future of their town. Throughout this thesis I argue that social wellbeing and lifestyle are important factors in Cardwell residents' choices and feature predominantly in their approaches to economic development. I contextualise this study through a comparative analysis of the effects of economic development on the wellbeing and lifestyle of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in the Cardwell region of north Australia. This comparison arises firstly from an anthropological interest in the circumstances of Australian Aboriginal people as a significant minority in regional towns. Explicit attention is directed toward the Aboriginal people of the Cardwell region as they constitute a socially and culturally distinct sector of the local population. Secondly, my study explores ways in which comparative work of this kind may be instructive on cultural issues relevant to economic development. This is a study of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people, who live in similar circumstances, and who, I propose, regard factors other than economic development as important. It is argued that while the Cardwell region does not provide ample nor a variety of economic opportunities, outward migration remains undesirable to many residents.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia -- Economic development -- Social aspects</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Economic development -- Cross-cultural studies</field><field name="subject">Australia -- Queensland -- Economic aspects</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal Australians -- Queensland -- Social conditions</field><field name="subject">Economic development</field><field name="subject">Social wellbeing</field><field name="subject">Aboriginal studies</field><field name="subject">Cardwell Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0184</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Regolith expression of hydrothermal alteration : a study of the Groundrush and Vera Nancy gold deposits of Northern Australia</field><field name="creator">Murphy, Daniel M.K.</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Mineralogical and geochemical characteristics were identified for regolith overlying two Australian Au deposits that discriminate mineralized and associated hydrothermally-altered rock from weathered rock that was not hydrothermally-altered. Mineralization was lithologically controlled within a previously unrecognized diorite dyke at the lower Proterozoic mesozonal Groundrush deposit, Tanami region, Northern Territory. Although hydrothermal alteration effects within the dyke were subtle and obliterated by weathering, Ti/Zr ratios clearly discriminated the diorite dyke from visually indistinguishable but generally unmineralized dolerite. In contrast, the Carboniferous Vera Nancy low-sulphidation epithermal Au deposit, located in the Drummond Basin, northeast Queensland, comprises structurally-controlled quartz veins within a relatively chemically homogenous suite of andesitic lavas and subvolcanic intrusions. A zoned hydrothermal alteration system in the hangingwall of the main vein grades from a proximal silica-pyrite alteration zone through an argillic zone into regionally extensive propylitic 'background'. Deep chemical weathering has destroyed the minerals diagnostic of the different alteration zones in bedrock to leave a kaolinitic regolith overlying all alteration zones. However, the silica-pyrite alteration zone is identified in regolith by retention of the anomalous concentrations of Au, As, Sb and Mo present in bedrock, and mineralogical characteristics, determined from X-ray diffraction investigations, discriminated weathered argillic from propylitic alteration zones. ...  Metasomatic reactions, including weathering reactions, are typically difficult to specify, as some reactants and products may be removed by fluids, and thus evidence for their involvement is absent from the observed assemblages. In addition, the range of possible reactions even for relatively simple systems is such that identifying the real reaction may be intractable without additional information. Linear algebra provides an approach to this problem. If minerals and aqueous phases are represented as columns in a matrix with elements as rows, any vectors in the null space of this matrix (if it is greater than 0-dimensional) provide coefficients to balance reactions between the phases. The 'Gale' vectors for a set of phase are the row vectors of any basis for this null space. The relationships between phases are clarified through examination of these vectors in d-dimensional Gale vector space, where d is the dimension of the null space. The hyperplane normal to any vector in Gale vector space separates the space into reactant and product half-spaces. The geometric relationships between the Gale phase vectors describe all the possible reactions. Because changes to parameters (e.g. volume, mass, density) can be determined for each possible reaction, Gale analysis can be used to identify reactions consistent with these constraints. Gale analysis of weathering at the Vera deposit indicated that all the possible weathering reactions producing kaolinite, goethite and quartz from illite, pyrite and siderite resulted in minor reductions in volume and mass only, whereas acid-neutral weathering of propylitic rocks exhibited greater mass losses, consistent with observation and geochemical interpretation.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Hydrothermal alteration -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Hydrothermal alteration -- Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Queensland</field><field name="subject">Gold ores -- Geology -- Northern Territory</field><field name="subject">Regolith</field><field name="subject">Geochemistry</field><field name="subject">Clay minerals</field><field name="subject">Transmission electron microscopy</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0186</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Outcomes of early rehabilitation following lumbar microdiscectomy</field><field name="creator">Lynn, Jennifer</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] There have been few studies into the effects of rehabilitation following lumbar microdiscectomy and consequently little evidence of its effect, if any, on outcome. Most studies cited fall into one of two categories: research involving a spinal surgery procedure without rehabilitation, or research involving spinal surgery with a nonspecific generic 'rehabilitation' or 'physical therapy'. In an era of evidence based medicine the efficacy of specific rehabilitation protocols following defined lumbar spine surgical procedures needs to be established for surgeons, therapists and patients to have confidence that the rehabilitation is appropriate and effective. The study was proposed to investigate the outcome of a specific and novel rehabilitation protocol commenced immediately after lumbar microdiscectomy. Data collected from the research cohort were compared to data collected from a contrast group who underwent standard rehabilitation at a distant site.  A retrospective study (Phase One) was carried out with a cohort of post-operative microdiscectomy patients between February 2000 and December 2002. The outcome of surgery followed by the rehabilitation protocol was assessed using validated outcome instruments. A contrast or control group was not included. After reviewing the data limitations with the design and implementation of the study were identified. A prospective study (Phase Two) was proposed and changes made in the principal outcome measure used, in the demographic data to be retrieved, the addition of pain scales, and in the exclusion of compensable patients. A contrast group was included for the prospective study. ...  The study group commenced exercise and posture correction the day following surgery. There were restrictions placed on activity involving bending. The contrast group followed the advice of the surgeon in Queensland and attended rehabilitation at local physiotherapy facilities. Both groups were followed for 12 months using outcome instruments. Strict comparison between WA and QLD cohorts were limited due to sample size, however trends were observed. Data of the prospective study showed that there was greater reduction in back pain with the early rehabilitation protocol (P&lt;.0001) compared to standard rehabilitation (P=.09), while there was no difference between groups in leg pain. There was a significant improvement in the level of functional disability between time-points for the WA cohort, and overall change from pre-operative RMQ measures to 12 months in both groups were statistically significant. The WA group was less reliant on pain medication and was more satisfied with the results of their surgery. The primary hypothesis of this study that there would be a difference in outcome following lumbar microdiscectomy in patients who receive early specific rehabilitation compared to those who receive standard rehabilitation at another centre, was supported in both primary and secondary outcome data. The key finding of this study was that commencing the early exercise protocol resulted in significantly less back pain over the 12 month time period of the study. Other major findings were that the WA cohort demonstrated significant improvement in function at all time-points and between all time-points except six to 12 months, took less pain medication and were more satisfied with the outcome of their surgery than the QLD cohort.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lumbar vertebrae -- Surgery -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Intervertebral disk -- Surgery -- Patients -- Rehabilitation</field><field name="subject">Lumbar microdiscectomy</field><field name="subject">Rehabilitation</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0187</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Processes and effects of root-induced changes to soil hydraulic properties</field><field name="creator">Scanlan, Craig Anthony</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Root-induced changes to soil hydraulic properties (SHP) are an essential component in understanding the hydrology of an ecosystem, and the resilience of these to climate change. However, at present our capacity to predict how roots will modify SHP and the consequences of this is limited because our knowledge of the processes and effects are highly fragmented. Also, current models used to investigate the relationship between plants and root-induced changes to SHP are based on empirical relationships which have limited applicability to the various and often contrasting ecosystems that occur. This thesis focuses specifically on the quantifying the processes by which roots modify SHP and developing models that can predict changes to these and the water balance. Both increase and decreases in saturated hydraulic conductivity have been attributed to the presence of roots. In general, decreases occur when the root system is relatively young, and increases occur when the roots senesce and begin to decay, creating voids for water flow. The evidence available suggests that the change in pore geometry created by roots is the dominant process by which roots modify SHP because they are more permanent and of a greater magnitude than changes to fluid properties or soil structure. We first quantified the effects of wheat roots on SHP of a coarse sand with a laboratory experiment where we measured changes in both SHP and the root system at 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks after sowing (weeks). ...  The main message that can be drawn from this thesis is that root-induced changes to SHP are dynamic, and dependent upon the combination of soil texture, connectivity of root-modified pores and the ratio of root radius to pore radius. Consequently, root-induced changes to the water balance have the same dependencies. The work in this thesis provides a significant first step towards improving our capacity to predict how roots modify soil hydraulic properties. By defining the range for the parameters used to predict how the soil is modified by roots, we are able to make quantitative assessments of how a property such as hydraulic conductivity will change for a realistic circumstance. Also , for the first time we have measured changes in soil hydraulic properties and roots and have been able to establish why a rapid change from a root-induced decrease to increase in Ks occurred. The link between physiological stage of the root system, and the changes that are likely to occur has implications for understanding how roots modify SHP: it may provide an effective tool for predicting when the switch from a decrease to increase occurs. Further work is required to test the validity of the assumptions we have made in our models that predict changes to SHP. While we have endeavoured to define the parameter space for those parameters that we have introduced, there is still some uncertainty about the connectivity of root-modified pores. Also, the parameterisation of the soil domain with roots is based upon work that measures 'fine' roots only which may not provide a true representation of the effect trees and perennial shrubs have on SHP. It is inevitable that root-induced changes to SHP will affect the fate of solutes in the soil, and temporal dynamics of root-induced changes to these may be particularly important for the timing of nutrient and pesticide leaching.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Ecohydrology</field><field name="subject">Plant-soil relationships</field><field name="subject">Plant-water relationships</field><field name="subject">Roots (Botany)</field><field name="subject">Soil mechanics</field><field name="subject">Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Roots</field><field name="subject">Soil hydraulic properties</field><field name="subject">Soil physics</field><field name="subject">Ecohydrology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0188</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An account by John Cananus of the siege of Constantinople in 1422</field><field name="creator">Purdie, Margaret Helen</field><field name="description">The purpose of this thesis has been to provide an English translation of</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cananus, Joannes, -- 15th century</field><field name="subject">Manuel -- Emperor of the East, -- 1350-1425</field><field name="subject">Military art and science -- History</field><field name="subject">Siege warfare</field><field name="subject">Byzantine Empire -- History -- Manuel II Palaeologus, 1391-1425</field><field name="subject">Turkey -- History -- Murad II, 1421-1451</field><field name="subject">Turkey -- History -- Ottoman Empire, 1288-1918</field><field name="subject">Istanbul (Turkey) -- History -- Siege, 1422</field><field name="subject">Ottomans and Constantinople</field><field name="subject">Manuel II Palaeologus</field><field name="subject">Murad II</field><field name="subject">Siege warfare</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0189</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Disability and the Australian neoliberal workfare state (1996-2005)</field><field name="creator">Soldatic, Karen Maree</field><field name="description">Australia, like other Western liberal democracies, has undergone extensive social policy restructuring as a result of neoliberalism. While neoliberalism had its genesis with Australian Labor governments during the 1980s, it secured the status of orthodoxy under the radical conservatism of the Liberal Coalition government (1996 - 2007). Under the leadership of Prime Minister John Howard a widespread campaign was instigated to advance neoliberal social policy measures across all spheres of social life, leading to the dismantling of rights for a diverse range of social groups including women, refugees, people with disabilities and Indigenous Australians. The restructuring of social provisioning with the intensification of neoliberalism was largely driven by workfare &#150; a key domestic social project of neoliberal global restructuring. The thesis examines the Australian experience of workfare and the primary areas of contestation and struggle that emerged in this environment for the Australian Disability Movement during the peak period of workfare restructuring for 'disability' (1996 &#150; 2005). The thesis draws on the work of critical disability theory to discuss the bivalent social collective identity of disability as it cuts through the politics of recognition and the politics of distribution. From here, the thesis engages with sociological work on emotions, bringing together theories of disgust and disability. The thesis demonstrates that there is a synergy between disability and disgust that informs the moral economy of disability; framing, shaping and articulating able-bodied &#150; disabled relations. Drawing on the policy process method the research involved extensive qualitative interviews with members of the Australian Disability Movement, disabled people involved in workfare programs, service providers and their peak organisations, families, as well as the policy elite charged with the responsibility of disability workfare restructuring. Additionally, the study incorporated a range of documents including parliamentary Hansards, key policy texts, government media releases, and publicly available information from disability specialist services and the disability movement. The analytical centrality of policy processes highlighted the strategic interrelationship between macro-structural policy discourses and practices and the role of policy actors as agents, including those collective agents engaged in mediating disability social relations. Three dominant themes emerged from the analysis of the data: movement politics, representation and participation; emotions and processes of moralisation; and finally, the role of temporality in inscribing (disabled) bodies with value. Each of the findings chapters is dedicated to explicating these mechanisms and the effects of these discourses and practices on disabled people involved in workfare programs and the disability movement's struggles for respect, recognition and social justice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Emotions</field><field name="subject">Neoliberalism -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Public welfare -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Social movements -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Social policy</field><field name="subject">Sociology of disability</field><field name="subject">Disability</field><field name="subject">Disgust</field><field name="subject">Neoliberal workfare</field><field name="subject">Movement politics</field><field name="subject">Temporality</field><field name="subject">Emotions</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0190</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of carbon nanotube-based gas and vapour sensors and supramolecular chemistry of carbon nano-materials</field><field name="creator">Hubble, Lee John</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The scientific endeavours described within this thesis attempt to create novel solutions to current scientific, commercial and industrial downfalls, and contribute to the advancement of technologies in these areas. This has been achieved through the application of theoretical and experimental principles, entrenched in the domains of chemistry and physics, which have been harnessed to assist in the transformation from nanoscience to nanotechnology. These solutions range from unique supramolecular systems capable of selective-diameter enrichment of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), to the fabrication of low-cost, potentially remote deployable carbon nanotube-based gas and vapour sensors, and expand right through to the development of water-soluble fluoroionophoric sensors and manipulations of a molecular form of carbon in constructing all-carbon nano-architectures. For the advancement and successful integration of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into commercial processes, the advent of scalable separation protocols based on their electronic properties is required. SWCNTs have been successfully solubilised using water-soluble p-phosphonated calix[n]arenes (n = 4, 6, 8) and 'extended arm' upper rim functionalised (benzyl, phenyl) p-sulfonated calix[8]arenes. Selective SWCNT diameter solubilisation has been demonstrated and subsequent preferential enrichment of SWCNTs with semiconducting or metallic electronic properties has been achieved. In addition, semiconducting nanotube-enriched supernatants (liquid) have been utilised to fabricate on/off field effect transistors (FET). These water-soluble supramolecular systems can be incorporated into post-growth purification protocols, with direct implications in areas such as carbon nano-electronics and device fabrication. In the current global environment there is a heightened level of public and governmental disquiet due to the reality of impending terrorist attacks. This is compounded by the inherent ease of manufacture and effectiveness of specific chemical warfare agents (CWAs) used in small-scale terrorist operations. ... Additional all-carbon structures are described with the formation of rings of helical SWCNT bundles through post-growth SWCNT modifications, and a variety of fibrous all-carbon structures, most notably novel square-geometry carbon nano-fibres (CNFs), through catalytic-chemical vapour deposition (C-CVD) synthesis strategies. The current requirement for entirely water-soluble fluorescent sensors is routinely documented in the literature. The autofluorescence properties of p-phenyl-sulfonated calix[8]arene are characterised and this water-soluble cavitand is surveyed as a metal cation sensor candidate. This particular system was found to exhibit a change in fluorescence response when exposed to divalent metal cations, and interactions with [UO2]2+, Pb2+, Co2+, and Cu2+ ions are discussed in detail. The system is characterised through a variety of analytical techniques to yield sensor calibration data, degradation characteristics, pH sensitivity and suitability as a 'small molecule' drug-carrier.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Calixarenes</field><field name="subject">Carbon</field><field name="subject">Chemical detectors</field><field name="subject">Fluorescent probes</field><field name="subject">Nanostructured materials</field><field name="subject">Nanostructures</field><field name="subject">Nanotechnology</field><field name="subject">Supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">Tubes</field><field name="subject">Carbon nanotubes and nanomaterials</field><field name="subject">Supramolecular chemistry</field><field name="subject">Calixarene chemistry</field><field name="subject">Detectors and sensors</field><field name="subject">Carbon nano-electronics</field><field name="subject">Fluorescent chemosensor</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0191</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A framework of adaptive T-S type rough-fuzzy inference systems (ARFIS)</field><field name="creator">Lee, Chang Su</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Fuzzy inference systems (FIS) are information processing systems using fuzzy logic mechanism to represent the human reasoning process and to make decisions based on uncertain, imprecise environments in our daily lives. Since the introduction of fuzzy set theory, fuzzy inference systems have been widely used mainly for system modeling, industrial plant control for a variety of practical applications, and also other decisionmaking purposes; advanced data analysis in medical research, risk management in business, stock market prediction in finance, data analysis in bioinformatics, and so on. Many approaches have been proposed to address the issue of automatic generation of membership functions and rules with the corresponding subsequent adjustment of them towards more satisfactory system performance. Because one of the most important factors for building high quality of FIS is the generation of the knowledge base of it, which consists of membership functions, fuzzy rules, fuzzy logic operators and other components for fuzzy calculations. The design of FIS comes from either the experience of human experts in the corresponding field of research or input and output data observations collected from operations of systems. Therefore, it is crucial to generate high quality FIS from a highly reliable design scheme to model the desired system process best. Furthermore, due to a lack of a learning property of fuzzy systems themselves most of the suggested schemes incorporate hybridization techniques towards better performance within a fuzzy system framework. ... This systematic enhancement is required to update the FIS in order to produce flexible and robust fuzzy systems for unexpected unknown inputs from real-world environments. This thesis proposes a general framework of Adaptive T-S (Takagi-Sugeno) type Rough-Fuzzy Inference Systems (ARFIS) for a variety of practical applications in order to resolve the problems mentioned above in the context of a Rough-Fuzzy hybridization scheme. Rough set theory is employed to effectively reduce the number of attributes that pertain to input variables and obtain a minimal set of decision rules based on input and output data sets. The generated rules are examined by checking their validity to use them as T-S type fuzzy rules. Using its excellent advantages in modeling non-linear systems, the T-S type fuzzy model is chosen to perform the fuzzy inference process. A T-S type fuzzy inference system is constructed by an automatic generation of membership functions and rules by the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm and the rough set approach, respectively. The generated T-S type rough-fuzzy inference system is then adjusted by the least-squares method and a conjugate gradient descent algorithm towards better performance within a fuzzy system framework. To show the viability of the proposed framework of ARFIS, the performance of ARFIS is compared with other existing approaches in a variety of practical applications; pattern classification, face recognition, and mobile robot navigation. The results are very satisfactory and competitive, and suggest the ARFIS is a suitable new framework for fuzzy inference systems by showing a better system performance with less number of attributes and rules in each application.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Adaptive control systems</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy sets</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy systems</field><field name="subject">Rough sets</field><field name="subject">Fuzzy set theory</field><field name="subject">Adaptive system</field><field name="subject">Rough set theory</field><field name="subject">Machine learning</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0192</field></doc><doc><field name="title">British policy on human trafficking : the role of non-governmental organisations in seeking change</field><field name="creator">Powell, Rebecca</field><field name="description">This thesis looks at the role of British anti-trafficking NGOs in the development of the British policy response to human trafficking. Anti-trafficking NGOs are classified as insiders in the policy process which allows them access to the decision makers during policy developments. Through their insider status, NGOs have promoted their policy agenda for a victim-centred, balanced policy response to human trafficking to the government. A balanced policy response to human trafficking that contains a law enforcement approach with adequate and supportive measures for the protection and support of trafficked victims, has been internationally hailed as being required to tackle human trafficking at a national level. Although the British government has welcomed the input of NGOs in policy developments in response to human trafficking in Britain, the government's primary association of human trafficking with illegal immigration has prevented NGOs from achieving influential success. This thesis argues that the government's associations of human trafficking with illegal immigration have prevented it from further developing its human rights response to trafficking. A victim-centred approach to trafficking will support the existing law enforcement response in achieving an increase in successful prosecutions against the traffickers. Further, it is noted that policy developments in Britain are incremental and slow and the development of a policy response to human trafficking is no exception. By looking at the latest stage of British policy developments on human trafficking, the possibility of a balanced response has emerged for the first time. However, although the government has indicated its commitment to achieving such a response, no practical policy initiatives have been developed or implemented to affirm this commitment. This thesis contributes to the existing and growing body of literature on human trafficking policy in the UK. It aims to contribute to an understanding of how British anti-trafficking NGOs have used their status as insiders in the policy making process in order to influence policy developments, and to understand the limited success that they have experienced.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Human trafficking -- Government policy -- Great Britain</field><field name="subject">Non-governmental organizations -- Great Britain</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0193</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Immune reactivity to metal implants</field><field name="creator">Chan, Erwin Pai Hsiung</field><field name="description">The use of metals like titanium (Ti) and vanadium (V) are common in many medical implants for orthopaedic and orthodontic purposes. The most frequent cause of implant failure is aseptic loosening, resulting from an inflammatory reaction and increased osteolysis at the bone-metal interface. Currently, the pathophysiological mechanism of aseptic loosening remains poorly understood. One hypothesis suggests the reactivity of immune cells (metal hypersensitivity) towards metal ions released through the biocorrosion of metal implants. This thesis examines the effects of titanium and vanadium ions on various immune cells like monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and T-lymphocytes. Thereby investigating the role and mechanism which titanium and vanadium plays in aseptic loosening. Through energy filtered transmission electron microscopy, the accumulation of titanium ions was visualized in human monocyte-derived DCs and T-lymphocytes after 24 hours exposure. Titanium was seen to co-localise with phosphorous-rich regions, like the cell membrane, organelles and nucleus of these cells. Flow cytometry measured changes in the cell surface marker expression of monocytes, osteoclasts, DCs and T-lymphocytes treated with the metals. Monocytes exposed to titanium (IV) showed an increase of Tartate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP), important for osteolysis and indicative of differentiation towards an osteoclast-like phenotype. DCs treated with Ti(IV) and vanadium (III) had reduced antigen presenting MHC class II expression, but not a reduced capacity to proliferate non-adherent peripheral blood monocytic cells (naPBMCs). Under the influence of Ti(IV), T-lymphocytes, DCs and monocytes expressed elevated levels of the chemokine receptor, CCR4. This would allow for the migration of CCR4+ cells towards the bone and skin regions. Functional changes were measured with BrdU incorporation proliferation assays, cytokine assays (CBA Kits) and the successful generation of titanium-specific T-lymphocytes from Ti(IV) treated DCs. Ti(IV) specific T-lymphocytes conceptually shows the possible formation of an antigenic titanium-protein complex, which can be recognized by the immune system. DCs treated with Ti(IV) and V(III) were able to cause the proliferation of naPBMCs, even with a reduced antigen presenting capability. However, there was no additional influence of V(III) on the immune response through DCs. Cytokines released by DCs and T-lymphocytes after Ti(IV) treatments showed a skew towards an inflammatory Th1-type response through the release of TGF-! and IL-12p70. Activated T-lymphocytes exposed to Ti(IV) also released RANK-L, which drives osteoclastogenesis and subsequently increased osteolysis. The research supports and suggests an interaction between immune and bone cells where titanium-induced inflammation drives an osteolytic cycle that prevents the integration of metal implants into the bone.

G. H.</field><field name="description">This thesis investigates the exact minimisation of treatment delivery time for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) for the treatment of cancer using Multileaf Collimators (MLC). Although patients are required to remain stationary during the delivery of IMRT, inevitably some patient movement will occur, particularly if treatment times are longer than necessary. Therefore minimising the treatment delivery time of IMRT may result in less patient movement, less inaccuracy in the dosage received and a potentially improved outcome for the patient. When IMRT is delivered using multileaf collimators in 'step and shoot' mode, it consists of a sequence of multileaf collimator configurations, or shape matrices; for each, time is needed to set up the configuration, and in addition the patient is exposed to radiation for a specified time, or beam-on time. The 'step and shoot leaf sequencing' problems for minimising treatment time considered in this thesis are the constant set-up time Total Treatment Time (TTT) problem and the Beam-on Time Constrained Minimum Cardinality (BTCMC) problem. The TTT problem minimises a weighted sum of total beam-on time and total number of shape matrices used, whereas the BTCMC problem lexicographically minimises the total beam-on time then the number of shape matrices used in a solution. The vast majority of approaches to these strongly NP-hard problems are heuristics; of the few exact approaches, the formulations either have excessive computation times or their solution methods do not easily incorporate multileaf collimator mechanical constraints (which are present in most currently used MLC systems). In this thesis, new exact mixed integer and integer programming formulations for solving the TTT and BTCMC problems are developed. The models and solution methods considered can be applied to the unconstrained and constrained versions of the problems, where 'constrained' refers to the modelling of additional MLC mechanical constraints. Within the context of integer programming formulations, new and existing methods for improving the computational efficiency of the models presented are investigated. Numerical results for all variations considered are provided. This thesis demonstrates that significant computational improvement can be achieved for the exact mixed integer and integer programming models investigated, via solution approaches based on an idea of systematically 'stepping-up' through the number of shape matrices used in a formulation, via additional constraints (particularly symmetry breaking constraints) and via the application of improved bounds on variables. This thesis also makes a contribution to the wider  field of integer programming through the examination of an interesting substructure of an exact integer programming model. In summary, this thesis presents a thorough analysis of possible integer programming models for the strongly NP-hard 'step and shoot' leaf sequencing problems and investigates and applies methods for improving the computational efficiency of such formulations. In this way, this thesis contributes to the  field of leaf sequencing for the application of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy using Multileaf Collimators.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer -- Radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Collimators (Optical instrument)</field><field name="subject">Image-guided radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">Radiotherapy</field><field name="subject">Radiography, Medical -- Digital techniques</field><field name="subject">Intensity modulated radiation therapy</field><field name="subject">Mathematical optimisation</field><field name="subject">Operations research</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0195</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The effectiveness of cross-selling as a relationship marketing initiative : an exploration of analytical and commonsense prediction</field><field name="creator">Ferguson, Graham</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Relationship marketing and some of its associated strategies, including customer relationship management (CRM), is an approach to marketing that is increasingly recognised as important by researchers and marketers. The approach suggests that marketers should focus on developing and maintaining strong relationships with existing customers in order to increase customer lifetime value (CLV) and to reduce the costs associated with constantly acquiring new customers. Advocates promote increased revenue per customer, increased products per customer (customer share), lower customer churn (higher retention) and increased chance that loyal customers will advocate on behalf of the organisation (positive word of mouth), as just some of the benefits of building relationships. While the concept of developing stronger relationships with customers appears convincing; the successful implementation of relationship marketing &amp; CRM initiatives has been a challenge for many enterprises. There are many reasons cited for this including differing benchmarks for success, the range of relationship marketing activities available to marketers, customer differences and how marketers choose to model customer response. To cut through this complexity and to contribute to the field, the current study was carried out to explore, in detail, a single relationship marketing initiative being implemented in a large consumer oriented organisation. The goals of the current study were to see whether the introduction of a cross-selling initiative (CSI) helped front line employees to cross-sell additional products to existing customers during face-to-face interactions and whether the technique used to predict product adoption influenced the effectiveness of those cross-selling activities. Cross-selling refers to the promotion of additional products to existing customers.  .... It was considered likely that retail employees would be more confident if they received a specific cross-selling recommendation for a customer and that the increased confidence would lead to increased cross-selling activity and better results. The results confirmed that:  Retail employees were more likely to approach a customer with a cross-sell offer if they had a specific recommendation for that customer.  Cross-sell offers based upon those recommendations were more likely to be successful.  Logistic regression was a better technique for identifying customers likely to adopt the product than anecdotal modelling approaches. The current study makes an important contribution to marketers considering or engaging in customer relationship marketing by confirming the effectiveness of CSIs. Based upon the results, CSIs appear to offer marketers an effective tool to increase customer share thereby increasing revenue and potentially increasing customer loyalty, tenure and profitability. The study also illustrates that effective modeling reduces the chance of making superfluous cross-selling offers to customers thereby reducing the cost of cross-selling, enhancing the confidence of retail employees and minimising the risk of damaging existing relationships. Overall, the study illustrates that the potential for CSIs as a relationship marketing tool is substantial and should not be underestimated.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Customer relations -- Management</field><field name="subject">Customer services -- Management</field><field name="subject">Consumer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">Marketing</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Selling</field><field name="subject">Relationship marketing</field><field name="subject">Next product to buy</field><field name="subject">Retail</field><field name="subject">CRM</field><field name="subject">Action research</field><field name="subject">Cross-selling</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0196</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An autoethnographic study of the rise and fall of intimacy : an embedded journey of discovery</field><field name="creator">Upton-Davis, Karen</field><field name="description">The loss of intimacy is a pervasive tale, felt especially poignantly when the particular story, with its plot lines of love and betrayal, soaked as they are in rage and grief, is my own.

It has been previously proposed that the descending auditory pathways, in particular the medial olivocochlear system, play a role in reducing the cochlea's response to noise in a process known as antimasking. This hypothesis was investigated in human subjects for its potential impact on the detection of signals in noise following auditory cues. Three experimental chapters (Chapters 3, 4 and 5) are described in this thesis. Experiments in the first chapter measured the effect of acoustic cues on the detection of subsequent tones of equal or different frequency. Results show that changes in the ability to detect signals following auditory cues are the result of both enhanced detection for tones at the cued frequency, and suppressed detection for tones at non-cue frequencies. Both effects were measured to be in the order of ~3 dB. This thesis has argued that the enhancement of a cued tone is the implicit result of an auditory cue, while suppression of a probe tone results from the expectation of a specific frequency based on accumulated experience of a listening task. The properties of enhancement support the antimasking hypothesis, however, the physiological mechanism for suppression is uncertain. In the second experimental chapter, auditory cues were replaced with visual cues (representing musical notes) whose pitch corresponded to the target frequency, and were presented to musician subjects who possessed absolute or relative pitch. Results from these experiments showed that a visual cue produces the same magnitude of enhancement as that produced by an acoustic cue. This finding demonstrates a cognitive influence on the detection of tones in noise, and implicates the role of higher centres such as those involved in template-matching or top-down control of the efferent pathways. The final experimental chapter repeated several of the experiments from the first chapter on subjects with various forms of hearing loss. The results indicate that subjects with an outer hair cell deficit (concomitant with a sensorineural hearing loss) do not exhibit an enhancement of cued frequencies or a suppression of unexpected frequencies to the same extent as the normal-hearing subjects. In addition, one subject with a long-standing conductive hearing loss (with normal cochlear function) produced an enhancement equivalent to that of the normalhearing subjects. These findings also support the role of the medial olivocochlear system and the outer hair cells in antimasking. It is the conclusion of this thesis that enhancement most likely results from a combination of changes in receptive field characteristics, at various levels of the auditory system. The medial olivocochlear system is likely to be involved in unmasking a portion of the signal at the cochlear level, which may be influenced by both acoustic reflex pathways or higher centres of the brain.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Attention</field><field name="subject">Auditory pathways</field><field name="subject">Listening</field><field name="subject">Selectivity (Psychology)</field><field name="subject">Sound</field><field name="subject">Auditory attention</field><field name="subject">Attentional filter</field><field name="subject">Selective listening</field><field name="subject">Olivocochlear</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0198</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification du facteur catalytique du processus d'edition des ARN des organites chez les plantes = Identification of the RNA editing enzyme in plant organelles</field><field name="creator">Salone, V&#233;ronique</field><field name="description">Il serait opportun de d&#233;buter cette introduction en donnant une d&#233;finition claire du processus d'&#233;dition des ARN, mais c'est aussi un exercice p&#233;rilleux car le terme d'&#233;dition des ARN a &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233; dans la litt&#233;rature pour d&#233;crire une multitude de processus biochimiques diff&#233;rents et la distinction entre les processus d'&#233;dition ou de modification est parfois confuse.

The family of synthetic PPAR  agonists, the thiazolidinediones (TZDs), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been implicated in the inhibition of cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC-3 and DU145) prostate cancer cells generating much interest in their use for potential curative cancer therapies. In light of the potential use of TZDs and NSAIDs in prostate cancer prevention and their ability to induce inhibitory effects in vitro and in vivo, the first aim of this project was to undertake a comprehensive study of the effects of ciglitazone (TZD) and indomethacin (NSAID) on the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145, using standardised concentrations and time-points to compare the effects of TZDs and NSAIDs on cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis. Treating the cells with either 10 &#181;M ciglitazone or 10 &#181;M indomethacin resulted in a time-dependent decrease in DU145 cell proliferation. The anti-proliferative effects were found to be in-part attributed to the slowing of cell progression through the G1/S-phase checkpoint of the cell cycle, and in the case of ciglitazone, apoptosis also played a role in its anti-proliferative effects in this cell line. Interestingly, although indomethacin failed to induce apoptosis, its antiproliferative effects were more potent than ciglitazone. The second aim of this project was to further investigate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the anti-proliferative effects of ciglitazone and indomethacin by evaluating their ability to modulate PPAR  mRNA and protein expression, and to induce PPAR  transcriptional activity. ... In addition, ligandinduced regulation of secreted frizzled related protein 4 (sFRP4) expression, a Wnt/ - catenin antagonists, was investigated. It was demonstrated that both ciglitazone and indomethacin attenuated Wnt/ -catenin signalling via the down-regulation of total  - catenin levels within the cells, inhibition or slowing of the translocation of cytoplasmic  -catenin into the nucleus and inhibition of cyclin&#150;D1 expression An inverse relationship between PPAR  and  -catenin protein levels was also detected, suggesting that PPAR  may directly bind to  -catenin itself. sFRP4 expression was transiently upregulated by ciglitazone and indomethacin-treatment, suggesting that the antiproliferative effects of the ligands may be mediated in part through regulation of sFRP4 mRNA and protein levels. In summary, the anti-proliferative effects of ciglitazone and indomethacin on the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line, DU145, described in this thesis are progressive steps in characterising the role of PPAR  in prostate cancer cell proliferation. The identification of indomethacin as a more potent PPAR  agonist than ciglitazone represents a novel target for the development of preventative strategies for advanced disease, and the relationship between PPAR  and the Wnt/ -catenin signalling pathway provide an insight into the mechanisms involved in the anti-proliferative effects of ciglitazone and indomethacin. Further studies into this relationship would advance help identify novel preventative and curative therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancer.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Prostate -- Cancer -- Treatment</field><field name="subject">Thiazoles -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents -- Therapeutic use</field><field name="subject">Thiazolidinediones</field><field name="subject">Androgen-independent prostate cancer</field><field name="subject">Wnt/B-catenin signalling cascade</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0200</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australian takeover waves : a re-examination of patterns, causes and consequences</field><field name="creator">Duong, Lien Thi Hong</field><field name="description">This thesis provides more precise characterisation of patterns, causes and consequences of takeover activity in Australia over three decades spanning from 1972 to 2004. The first contribution of the thesis is to characterise the time series behaviour of takeover activity. It is found that linear models do not adequately capture the structure of merger activity; a non-linear two-state Markov switching model works better. A key contribution of the thesis is, therefore, to propose an approach of combining a State-Space model with the Markov switching regime model in describing takeover activity. Experimental results based on our approach show an improvement over other existing approaches. We find four waves, one in the 1980s, two in the 1990s, and one in the 2000s, with an expected duration of each wave state of approximately two years. The second contribution is an investigation of the extent to which financial and macro-economic factors predict takeover activity after controlling for the probability of takeover waves. A main finding is that while stock market boom periods are empirically associated with takeover waves, the underlying driver is interest rate level. A low interest rate environment is associated with higher aggregate takeover activity. This relationship is consistent with Shleifer and Vishny (1992)'s liquidity argument that takeover waves are symptoms of lower cost of capital. Replicating the analysis to the biggest takeover market in the world, the US, reveals a remarkable consistency of results. In short, the Australian findings are not idiosyncratic. Finally, the implications for target and bidder firm shareholders are explored via investigation of takeover bid premiums and long-term abnormal returns separately between the wave and non-wave periods. This represents the third contribution to the literature of takeover waves. Findings reveal that target shareholders earn abnormally positive returns in takeover bids and bid premiums are slightly lower in the wave periods. Analysis of the returns to bidding firm shareholders suggests that the lower premiums earned by target shareholders in the wave periods may simply reflect lower total economic gains, at the margin, to takeovers made in the wave periods. It is found that bidding firms earn normal post-takeover returns (relative to a portfolio of firms matched in size and survival) if their bids are made in the non-wave periods. However, bidders who announce their takeover bids during the wave periods exhibit significant under-performance. For mergers that took place within waves, there is no difference in bid premiums and nor is there a difference in the long-run returns of bidders involved in the first half and second half of the waves. We find that none of theories of merger waves (managerial, mis-valuation and neoclassical) can fully account for the Australian takeover waves and their effects. Instead, our results suggest that a combination of these theories may provide better explanation. Given that normal returns are observed for acquiring firms, taken as a whole, we are more likely to uphold the neoclassical argument for merger activity. However, the evidence is not entirely consistent with neo-classical rational models, the under-performance effect during the wave states is consistent with the herding behaviour by firms.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Consolidation and merger of corporations -- Australia -- 1972-2004</field><field name="subject">Consolidation and merger of corporations -- Australia -- Econometric models</field><field name="subject">Mergers and acquisitions</field><field name="subject">Merger waves</field><field name="subject">Takeover waves</field><field name="subject">State-space models</field><field name="subject">Markov-switching model</field><field name="subject">Long-term post-bid performance</field><field name="subject">Takeover premiums</field><field name="subject">Herding</field><field name="subject">Capital liquidity</field><field name="subject">Macro-economic factors</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0201</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the interactions across international stock, bond and foreign exchange markets</field><field name="creator">Hakim, Abdul</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Given the theoretical and historical evidence that support the benefit of investing internationally. there is Iittle knowledge available of proper international portfolio construction in terms of how much should be invested in foreign countries, which countries should be targeted, and types of assets to be included in the portfolio. The prospects of these benefits depend on the market volatilities, cross-country correlations, and currency risks to change in the future. Another important issue in international portfolio diversification is the growth of newly emerging markets which have different characteristics from the developed ones. Addressing the issues, the thesis intends to investigate the nature of volatility, conditional correlations, and the impact of currency risks in international portfolio, both in developed and emerging markets. Chapter 2 provides literature review on volatility spillovers, conditional correlations, and forecasting both VaR and conditional correlations using GARCH-type models. Attention is made on the estimated models, type of assets, regions of markets, and tests of forecasts. Chapter 3 investigates the nature of volatility spillovers across intemational assets, which is important in determining the nature of portfolio's volatility when most assets are seems to be connected.  ... The impacts of incorporating volatility spillovers and asymmetric effect on the forecast performance of conditional correlation will also be examined in this thesis. The VARMA-AGARCH of McAleer, Hoti and Chan (2008) and the VARMA-GARCH model of Ling and McAleer (2003) will be estimated to accommodate volatility spillovers and asymmetric effect. The CCC model of Bollerslev (1990) will also be estimated as benchmark as the model does not incorporate both volatility spillovers and asymmetric effects. Given the information about the nature of conditional correlations resulted from the forecasts using a rolling window technique, Section 2 of Chapter 4 investigates the nature of conditional correlations by estimating two multivariate GARCH models allowing for time-varying conditional correlations, namely the DCC model of Engle (2002) and the GARCC model of McAleer et al. (2008). Chapter 5 conducts VaR forecast considering the important role of VaR as a standard tool for risk management. Especially, the chapter investigates whether volatility spillovers and time-varying conditional correlations discussed in the previous two chapters are of helps in providing better VaR forecasts. The BEKK model of Engle and Kroner (1995) and the DCC model of Engle (2002) will be estimated to incorporate volatility spillovers and conditional correlations, respectively. The DVEC model of Bollerslev et al. (1998) and the CCC model of Bollerslev (1990) will be estimated to serve benchmarks, as both models do not incorporate both volatility spillovers and timevarying conditional correlations.

If fewer than 75 years have elapsed since death, remains are classified as anthropological and of forensic interest. However, an accurate and reliable method for estimating time since death (TSD) from human skeletal remains has thus far eluded forensic anthropologists. This study investigates the application in an Australian context of a novel approach proposed by Swift (2001) to dating skeletal remains from their contained levels of radioisotopes 210Po, 238U and 226Ra and trace elements. Radionuclide activity concentrations were determined using alpha and gamma spectrometry. Trace element concentrations were measured on three separate occasions using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Discriminant analysis of the combination of activity concentration values for 210Po, 238U and 226Ra indicated the possibility of separation of bones derived from individuals who had died in the three eras of interest. Additionally, variations in the concentration levels of specific trace elements and certain inter-element relationships between elements also showed significant correlations with TSD. The study could not be exhaustive as access to human skeletal material was limited and additionally, the archaeological material had a different origin and post-death history to material from the more recent past. However, trend lines for inter-relationships between specific metals and for radionuclides indicated that all material fitted the same generally projected trends and as such, inferences with respect to variations of trace elements and radionuclides could be made with confidence. Bone radionuclide activity and calcium concentrations were all significantly higher in bones from the archaeological era than those from more recent eras, while trace lead concentrations contained in samples from the more recent historical era were significantly higher than those from other eras. Barium, lanthanum, rubidium, strontium, cerium and neodymium concentrations were all significantly correlated with one another and with radionuclide activity concentrations. Differences were found between the patterns of radionuclide activity and trace element concentrations between the skull and femur. The results of this study lend support to suggestions that multivariate analysis of trace element concentrations and radionuclide activity levels could aid in the estimation of time since death from skeletal remains in Australia. Although this study made use of only a limited amount of material, results clearly indicated the need to take into account variations arising from lifetime activities, diagenesis and bone type in applying the techniques to estimations of time since death. It highlights the need for a large-scale study using bone of known ages that systematically examines these influences on the estimation of time since death.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Bones -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Death -- Time of</field><field name="subject">Forensic osteology</field><field name="subject">Human skeleton -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Radioisotope scanning</field><field name="subject">Trace elements -- Analysis</field><field name="subject">Time since death</field><field name="subject">Trace element</field><field name="subject">Radioisotope</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0204</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of the female reproductive hormones in Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="creator">Barron, Anna May</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Alzheimer&#146;s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease which manifests clinically as personality changes and global cognitive decline resulting in a loss of function, ultimately leading to death. Whilst causal genetic mutations have been identified, accounting for a small proportion of familial cases, the vast majority of all AD cases are late onset and idiopathic. However, a number of risk factors have been identified, including age associated changes in the reproductive hormones &#150; estrogen and the gonadotropins. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated both estrogen and the gonadotropins in the regulation of the neurotoxic beta amyloid (A&#223;) peptide, accumulation of which is thought to be a key pathogenic event in the development of AD, but the role of these hormones in the etiology and pathogenesis of AD remains contentious. The aim of this thesis was to further understanding of the role of female reproductive hormones in modulating susceptibility to AD. The role of menopausal hormone dysregulation in behavior, cognitive decline and A&#223;-related neuropathology was examined in vivo in 4 studies using animal models of AD and menopause. The first two studies used a mouse model of AD expressing a human PS1 mutation (PS1KI) to examine the effects of ovariectomy as a model of menopause on cognition and neuropathology. Ovariectomy was found to selectively impair learning on a spatial working memory task without affecting working memory recall or reference memory performance. However, this cognitive impairment was not associated with any changes in A&#223; accumulation or oxidative stress. ... However, these findings cannot explain the lack of effect of estrogen supplementation on A&#223; levels. It is possible that supra-physiological doses of estrogen are necessary to yield anti-amyloidogenic and anti-oxidative benefits in ovariectomized sheep. It is becoming clear that the relationship between hormone changes at menopause and risk of AD may be more complicated than previously conceived. This study has begun to tease apart the relative contributions of estrogen and the gonadotropin hormones in the modulation of A&#223;, accumulation of which may confer susceptibility to AD. The findings presented indicate that the gonadotropins may play an important role in the regulation of AD-related behavior and cognition. The observed functional effects of the gonadotropins may also have implications for our understanding of behavioral and cognitive changes occurring during reproductive events. Based on the evidence presented here, combined with previous literature, it is clear that both estrogen and the gonadotropins are involved in the modulation of A&#223; accumulation, however, elucidation of the circumstances necessary to elicit these effects and their clinical relevance to humans will require further investigation. These findings contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of the post-menopausal hormonal milieu, recognizing the role of the gonadotropin hormones and that gonadal estrogen depletion does not necessarily result in brain estrogen depletion.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Alzheimer's disease</field><field name="subject">Amyloid beta-protein</field><field name="subject">Cognition</field><field name="subject">Estrogen</field><field name="subject">Gonadotropin</field><field name="subject">Menopause -- Hormone therapy</field><field name="subject">Estrogen</field><field name="subject">Beta amyloid</field><field name="subject">Gonadotropin</field><field name="subject">Learning and memory</field><field name="subject">Hormone therapy</field><field name="subject">Menopause</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0205</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Epithelial cell regulation of dentritic cell maturation in the airway mucosa : studies in an in vitro model system</field><field name="creator">Rate, Angela</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Atopic asthma pathogenesis is driven by the combined effects of airway inflammation generated during responses to viral infections and aeroallergens, and both of these pathways are regulated by dendritic cells (DC) that differentiate locally from monocytic precursors. These DC normally exhibit a sentinel phenotype characterised by active antigen sampling but attenuated presentation capability, which limits the intensity of local expression of adaptive immunity. How this tight control of airway DC functions is normally maintained and why it breaks down in some atopics leading to immunopathological changes in airway tissues, is unknown. In the airway mucosa, DC are intimately associated with airway epithelial cells (AEC), which are a source of a range of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. A few studies have previously examined the effects of AEC-derived surface-expressed and soluble mediators upon the function of pre-differentiated DC, although there is a dearth of information as to the extent of AEC-conditioning of DC during their generation from incoming monocytic precursors within the airways. Therefore, this study was designed to test the hypothesis that signals from adjacent AEC contribute to regulation of local differentiation of airway mucosal DC, especially in the context of allergic airway disease. A direct co-culture model was developed containing the AEC line 16HBE 14o- as a surrogate for primary AEC, and purified peripheral blood monocytes derived from atopic patients in a GM-CSF/IL-4-enriched cytokine milieu. Cells were cultured for 5 days, at which time the phenotype and functional attributes of the monocyte-derived DC (MDDC) generated in the presence of AEC (AEC-MDDC) were compared to the control MDDC population generated without AEC contact (Ctrl- MDDC). ...  In parallel, an attenuation of mRNA boosting for 7 out of 12 selected Th2-asscociated genes as well as IL-13 protein, was observed in AEC-MDDC supplemented cultures compared to ctrl-MDDC supplemented cultures. The data collected in the initial characterisation of the AEC-MDDC in Chapter 3 and further analysis of their gene expression profiles by microarray suggest a number of DC-associated factors could be involved in directing a potential bias against Th2 immunity within the T-cell recall response. These include increased expression of IL- 12 subunit mRNA and the enhanced levels of surface MHC Class II, CD80, ICAM-1 and SLAM. Further to Th1/Th2 modulation, a number of T-regulatory (Treg) genes were differentially expressed in the AEC-MDDC-re-activated CD4+ T-cells, and members of the chemokine and metallothionein families were elevated in the same population.  Collectively the results of this study suggest that in the context of the atopic airway microenvironment where there is an abundance of Th2-related mediators, healthy AEC arm locally maturing DC with an arsenal of anti-microbial defences that can be rapidly employed in response to encounter with inhaled pathogens, in particular viruses. In this way, the DC are maintained in an ideal functional phenotype to efficiently mobilise both innate and Th1-polarised adaptive immune defences against infection, whilst achieving tight control of potentially-damaging Th2 immunity to aeroallergens, thus contributing to the maintenance of immunological homeostasis within the respiratory tract.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Dendritic cells</field><field name="subject">Epithelial cells</field><field name="subject">Mucous membrane</field><field name="subject">Regulation of dentritic cells by airway epithelial cells</field><field name="subject">Immunology</field><field name="subject">Asthma</field><field name="subject">Airway epithelial cells</field><field name="subject">Dentritic cells</field><field name="subject">Airways</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0206</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Economics of protecting road infrastructure from dryland salinity in Western Australia</field><field name="creator">Graham, Tennille</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The salinisation of agricultural land, urban infrastructure and natural habitat is a serious and increasing problem in southern Australia. Government funding has been allocated to the problem to attempt to reduce substantial costs associated with degradation of agricultural and non-agricultural assets. Nevertheless, Government funding has been small relative to the size of the problem and therefore expenditure needs to be carefully targeted to interventions that will achieve the greatest net benefits. For intervention to be justified, the level of salinity resulting from private landholder decisions must exceed the level that is optimal from the point of view of society as a whole, and the costs of government intervention must be less than the benefits gained by society. This study aims to identify situations when government intervention is justified to manage dryland salinity that threatens to affect road infrastructure (a public asset). A key gap in the environmental economics literature is research that considers dryland salinity as a pollution that has off-site impacts on public assets. This research developed two hydrological/economic models to achieve this objective. The first was a simple economic model representing external costs from dryland salinity. This model was used to identify those variables that have the biggest impact on the net-benefits possible from government intervention. The second model was a combined hydro/economic model that represents the external costs from dryland salinity on road infrastructure. The hydrological component of the model applied the method of metamodelling to simplify a complex, simulation model to equations that could be easily included in the economic model. The key variables that have the biggest impact on net-benefits of dryland salinity mitigation were the value of the off-site asset and the time lag before the onset of dryland salinity in the absence of intervention. ...  In the case study of dryland salinity management in the Date Creek subcatchment of Western Australia, the economics of vegetation-based and engineering strategies were investigated for road infrastructure. In general, the engineering strategies were more economically beneficial than vegetation-based strategies. In the case-study catchment, the cost of dryland salinity affecting roads was low relative to the cost to agricultural land. Nevertheless, some additional change in land management to reduce impacts on roads (beyond the changes justified by agricultural land alone) was found to be optimal in some cases. Reinforcing the results from the simple model, a key factor influencing the economics of dryland salinity management was the urgency of the problem. If costs from dryland salinity were not expected to occur until 30 years or more, the optimal response in the short-term was to do nothing. Overall, the study highlights the need for governments to undertake comprehensive and case-specific analysis before committing resources to the management of dryland salinity affecting roads. There were many scenarios in the modelling analysis where the benefits of interventions would not be sufficient to justify action.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Salinization -- Control -- Economic aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Roads -- Maintenance and repair -- Environmental aspects -- Western Australia</field><field name="subject">Dryland salinity</field><field name="subject">Environmental policy</field><field name="subject">Resource economics</field><field name="subject">Hydrology</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0207</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Identification of the glenohumeral joint rotation centre : an MRI validation study</field><field name="creator">Campbell, Amity</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] Normal and pathological upper limb movement assessments rely on the valid and reliable identification of the glenohumeral joint centre of rotation (GHJ). However, clarifying the most suitable techniques to identify and reference this location has proved a challenge, and performing a variety of methods that lack validation is commonplace. This may not only be erroneous, but also prevents the standardised collection of upper limb biomechanical information. The principle aim of this research was to clarify the accuracy and reliability of various methods of GHJ identification, including both predictive and functional techniques, as well as the error associated with referencing the GHJ location during dynamic movement trials. Predictive methods of GHJ identification rely on a generic relationship between the GHJ position and predetermined anatomical distances or locations. The ISB recommended predictive method was developed and validated using cadavers, and it appears that a number of convenient, yet to be validated methods are routinely performed in preference of this recommended technique. In the present study, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was utilised to validate, in vivo, the accuracy of various predictive approaches; the ISB recommended method and a representative sample of commonly used techniques. A new multiple linear regression model and simple 3D offset method, were developed from the MRI identified locations of the GHJ and the surface markers. The results indicated that the new multiple linear regression model (13 &#177;4.6) mm and simple 3D offset (12 &#177;4.6 mm) found an average GHJ location closer to the MRI determined location than any of the established predictive methods (14-50 mm), including the ISB recommended method (32 &#177;8.2 mm), and a recently publicised amended 2nd version (16 &#177;8.4 mm). ... For instance when the optimal algorithm (geometric sphere fit), marker set and movement trial were used in the functional approach, average in vivo accuracy errors of 27 &#177;8.6 mm were reported, around half the error reported by the most accurate and reliable predictive method (13 &#177;4.6 mm). A further investigation aimed to determine the most suitable location to reference the GHJ during dynamic motion analysis trials. The GHJ was referenced in a number of upper arm and acromion technical coordinate systems (TCSs) in a series of static MRIs. This permitted the error associated with each set of markers to be calculated in vivo. The results indicated that a combination of TCSs defined from two sets of markers; one placed on the acromial plateau and one located proximally on the upper arm, produced the most accurate results, recording an average of 18 &#177;4 mm of error following a large humeral elevation (up to 180&#176;). Furthermore, a distal upper arm set of markers proved to be inappropriate for GHJ referencing, reporting average errors greater than 30 cm in two large humeral elevations. Therefore, following the identification of the GHJ, its 3D location should be referenced in the average of two TCSs determined from respective sets of markers placed on the acromion and proximal upper arm, during dynamic trials.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Shoulder joint -- Mechanical properties</field><field name="subject">Shoulder joint -- Range of motion -- Measurement</field><field name="subject">Shoulder joint -- Magnetic resonance imaging</field><field name="subject">Shoulder modelling</field><field name="subject">MRI</field><field name="subject">Motion analysis</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0208</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Applying social capital to electronic networks of practice : blog communities</field><field name="creator">Buranaburivast, Vorapoj</field><field name="description">Blogging is a recent phenomenon with research currently focusing on how it facilitates both personal and organisational knowledge exchange (Aimeur, Brassard &amp; Paquet 2005; Hsu &amp; Lin 2008). Social capital is shown to be a crucial factor facilitating knowledge transfer (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998). Blogging is a new social communication technology enabling individuals to collaborate and share knowledge. This research investigates how three dimensions of social capital affect individual knowledge sharing in weblog communities. In particular, it explores how individuals exploit weblogs as a tool for conversational knowledge management in educational institutions. Following Wasko &amp; Faraj's (2005) study, the conceptual model is developed by setting eight independent variables from social capital dimensions and a dependent variable is set from individual behaviour in online knowledge sharing. Eight hypotheses are developed to test the relationship between these variables. A quantitative approach was applied for data collection and analysis. For data collection, an online survey was published in several Australian university weblog communities. An additional paper-based survey was distributed to the respondents in order to gain adequate sample size. For data analysis, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to eliminate measurement items that shared a significant residual value with other measurement items. Further, the models obtained from confirmatory factor analysis were used to test the hypotheses by multiple regression analysis. Results from multiple regression analysis on online knowledge sharing suggest that trust, personal reputation and enjoy helping are positively associated with individual online knowledge sharing. The stepwise estimation procedure was further adapted in the regression model. The results show that four independent variables became significant to the study. These four significant variables were individual expertise, trust, personal reputation and enjoy helping. Lastly, several limitations in this study such as the sample of university online setting and respondents' activities on weblogs are discussed. These limitations lead to the direction of future research provided in conclusion of this study.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Knowledge management -- Blogs -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Communication in organizations -- Blogs -- Australia</field><field name="subject">Universities and colleges -- Australia -- Communication systems</field><field name="subject">Social capital (Sociology)</field><field name="subject">Online knowledge sharing</field><field name="subject">Blog communities</field><field name="subject">Electronic networks</field><field name="subject">Social capital</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The determinants of effectiveness of sporting associations in Singapore</field><field name="creator">Koh-Tan, Angela</field><field name="description">This study explores the different perceptions of effectiveness among four constituent groups of stakeholders in Singapore national sports associations. The four groups are athletes, board members, coaches, and secretariat staff. The study applies a qualitative research methodology. It uses a focus group and semi-structured interviews across 25 national sports associations. The qualitative data is analysed using NVivo software to organise the data into general themes and as an aid in breaking the data into sub-themes. The four constituent groups discuss multi-faceted perceptions of effectiveness by providing varying interpretations, meanings, inferences, and relational issues depending on the roles they hold. While confirming multi-dimensional perceptions of effectiveness, the study uncovers three determinants of effectiveness that are not cited directly in the literature: communication, athlete management, and commitment and organisation of the management committee. The study suggests major tensions in terms of organisational and personal athlete outcomes. It also highlights the paramount importance of funding, both for sports development and the organisation's personnel staffing and systems. There is a symbiotic relationship between internal and external perceptions of influences on effective performance. The findings suggest constituent groups' perceptions of the Singapore Sports Council influence their perceptions of effectiveness within their own associations. In turn, SSC's policy making and organisational behaviour are perceived to affect how the effectiveness of constituent groups is evaluated as well as their scope for action within their organisations. The implications for sports administrators and policy makers include the need for better communications between and within constituent groups, quality leadership (with decisions based on sports management and sports science knowledge), a more equitable distribution of funds, an internal environment of trust and empowerment balanced by objectivism, and an external environment of realism balanced by recognition of the need for continual performance improvement.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Sports administration -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Sports -- Societies, etc.. -- Singapore -- Evaluation</field><field name="subject">Organizational effectiveness -- Singapore</field><field name="subject">Effectiveness</field><field name="subject">Sports management</field><field name="subject">National sports associations</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0210</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Study of macromolecules in phloem exudate of Lupinus albus</field><field name="creator">Rodriguez, Caren</field><field name="description">[Truncated abstract] The phloem long distance translocation system is not only involved in the transport of nutrients and photo-assimilates to different organs of the plant, but it also appears to be important for the transport of information molecules including growth-regulators, proteins and RNA. Translocation of signals appears to be involved in the coordination of developmental processes and also in the response of the plant to environmental cues. Much of the information about macromolecules in phloem comes from analyses of exudates collected from the stylets of sap sucking insects or from incisions made to the vasculature. Among the legumes, members of the genus Lupinus exude phloem 'freely' from incisions made to the vasculature at most organs of the plant. This feature was exploited in this study to document some of the macromolecules present in exudate of L. albus and which might represent potential mobile signals. Phloem exudate was collected mainly from the sutures of developing pods and from inflorescence racemes. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry were used to identify 83 proteins in exudate. Analysis of a cDNA library constructed from exudate identified 609 unique transcripts. Both proteins and mRNA were classified into functional groups. The largest group was related to general and energy metabolism, suggesting some metabolic activity probably to support the sieve element (SE). Other significant functional groups were represented by proteins and transcripts involved in protein synthesis, turnover and sorting, and in redox homeostasis. Proteins in these categories could play a role in maintaining the functions and stability of proteins in SE. Macromolecules involved in signalling such as transcripts encoding proteins mediating calcium levels and the Flowering locus T (FT) protein were also identified in phloem exudate of L. albus. FT protein has been recently identified as a mobile signal that induces flowering. ... The hen1 mutant accumulates low, sometimes even undetectable levels of miRNA due to the lack of methylation. No translocation of the five miRNA assayed under nutrient replete (non stress) conditions was observed. Translocation of miR395 in response to sulphur (S) deficiency was also investigated, and while conclusive evidence of translocation was not obtained, the data suggested some movement from roots to shoots (possibly in xylem) of a signal in response to S-deficiency. Future work is required to provide greater insight into the translocation path and identity of this S-deficiency signal. This study suggests that not all miRNA identified in phloem exudates are mobile, which raises the question about their biological relevance in SE and how they reached this location (e.g. through the action of a non-selective transport mechanism). However, there is also the possibility that miRNA are translocated only in response to specific internal or external cues not tested in this study. This is the first study that provides information on macromolecules present in the phloem exudate of a member of the Fabaceae. The information obtained from this work, provides a basis for future studies in the identification of potential mobile signals that may play a role in a communication network that traffics information around the plant, regulating its various developmental processes and responding to environmental cues.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">eng</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Lupines -- Physiology</field><field name="subject">Lupines -- Molecular aspects</field><field name="subject">Plant translocation</field><field name="subject">Cellular signal transduction</field><field name="subject">Lupinus albus</field><field name="subject">Phloem tissue</field><field name="subject">Phloem macromolecules</field><field name="subject">miRNA</field><field name="identifier">http://theses.library.uwa.edu.au/adt-WU2009.0211</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Formal and Informal Controls of Government over Social Security Expenditure-An Analysis</field><field name="creator">Grose, Robert</field><field name="description">While a significant amount of research has examined the more traditional budgetary and procedural controls used by governments to maintain control over social security expenditure, very little research has examined the more obscure formal social controls used to achieve the same purpose.      The primary aim of this study was to fill this research vacuum by examining both the formal and informal mechanisms used by governments to maintain control over social security expenditure and to achieve longer-term public policy appropriation. In particular the study focused on the payment of Job Newstart and Youth Allowances and how the social control discourse of marginalisation was used to achieve such control.       The study was undertaken in two stages. In stage one, an e-mail questionnaire was distributed to Job Network consultants (n = 739) employed at 66 not-for-profit Job Network Providers throughout Australia. In stage two, focus group interviews were conducted to expand on the responses previously obtained from the e-mail questionnaire survey.       The study produced several significant findings from the views of Job Network consultants. Most significantly the results support Foucault's discourse on marginalisation. That is the results help to explain how consultants identify and single out people who do not fit the norm and therefore represent a case for special treatment. The effect of this marginalisation process is that governments are able to assert power and authority over welfare claimants and that the process is justified from the government's viewpoint. It would also seem that society and the individual accept such institutional arrangements. The techniques of marginalisation are disciplinary in their nature and relate to the multiplication of social security rules and procedures and a correlative division of the claimant population in accordance with constitutive criteria of status and entitlement. The study also concluded that Job Network consultants recognised that the breaching regime should be modified longer-term to take account of the i nformal ethical and moral criteria of fairness, justice and the rights of individuals. Having said this however, the same group of consultant's indicated in very strong terms that recipients' of Newstart and Youth Allowances should comply with their mutual obligation requirements and that they should be penalised in those instances where they do not comply with these requirements.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Formal controls</field><field name="subject">informal controls</field><field name="subject">social security expenditure</field><field name="subject">marginalisation</field><field name="subject">ethics.</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20080627.102004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Traversing the boundaries?
Art and film in Indonesia with particular reference to Perbatasan / boundaries: Lucia Hartini, paintings from a life</field><field name="creator">Jennifier Ann Dudley</field><field name="description">The repressive political conditions of the New Order state and the social dislocation caused by rapid industrial and technological development unquestionably affected the nature of artistic and cultural production in Indonesia. This thesis considers the dynamic of these conditions within a focused long-term study of the art and life of Indonesian &#147;Surealis&#148; painter, Lucia Hartini. My doctoral dissertation comprises this thesis and the forty-two minute documentary film Perbatasan / Boundaries: Lucia Hartini, Paintings from a Life (1999 &#150; 2002) which I filmed in Indonesia and presents Lucia Hartini and her art in the context of her times from the historical standpoint of Reformasi and millennial change. Art historically, this thesis informs us of a wider journey, that of selected twentieth century Indonesian contemporary artists exploring concepts of simulacra, hyper-reality, the meta-real and the surreal through the stylistic use of photo-realism.

Lucia Hartini is known for her &#147;Beautiful Surrealism&#148;. A founding member of the &#147;Surealis Yogya&#148;, formed in 1985, she was the only woman from the original group to continue painting professionally from the late 1970s, throughout the New Order, and into the era of Reform. The consideration of Lucia Hartini&#146;s work in this thesis acknowledges the gradual shift in her concerns. Lucia&#146;s paintings respond to her natural and social environment, as well as to the challenges and dramatic changes in her life. This thesis charts the journey of her artistic maturation, so richly embodied in her third solo exhibition, &#147;Irama Kehidupan / The Spirit of Life&#148;, in January 2002. Through a critical commentary on paintings selected from her oeuvre and the textual analysis of Perbatasan / Boundaries, I discuss Lucia Hartini&#146;s subject matter, unique systems of image formation and use of detail, her particular contribution to the characteristic qualities of Indonesian &#147;Surealisme&#148;. I regard the techniques, conceptual approaches and processes of filmmaking as intrinsic to this exploration, a methodological perspective arising from Hendro Wiyanto (2001) observation that Indonesia&#146;s &#147;Surealis&#148; artists present us with &#147;reality bundled as a dream&#148;.

Lucia Hartini&#146;s work raises questions of gender and personal transformation. This thesis argues that, for many years, the tensions created by the contrary forces of political repression and social transformation characterising much of New Order Indonesia, were reflected in her art. In a microcosmic-macrocosmic sense, Lucia and her art quietly contributed to attitudinal and social change in Indonesia. Works painted between 1986 and 1996 autobiographically chart a shift from personal distress to a growing sense of empowerment, followed by life-changing spiritual growth. I contextualize these paintings socially by studying the changing interstices between Lucia Hartini&#146;s private life, her professional creative practice and the public persona she adopted in Indonesia&#146;s emergent civilian society. My approach is informed by a conceptual framework based on difference, hybridity and its transformations, on the psychology of borderlands, negotiation and the transcendence of boundaries, witnessed through a study of the spiritual practice and quest for religious tolerance important to Lucia and evident in her art. This thesis reveals those boundaries which were transcended and those which remain negotiable.

Twice filming Lucia Hartini&#146;s art, I was also affected by the dramatically different conditions of production prevailing in 1992 in New Order Indonesia and those possible between 1999 and 2001 during Reformasi. These differences are highlighted in the textual analysis of Perbatasan / Boundaries. Engaging comparisons between contemporary Indonesian art and Indonesian documentary and feature films, I discuss important attempts to solve the problems associated with restrictions on freedom of expression in paintings made prior to Reformasi. I consider the different uses of figurative realism to depict subjects deemed controversial by the state, and the creation of credible representations in art and convincing characterisations in filmmaking. The dramatically real yet poetic work of the Indonesian Neo-realist filmmakers of the 1950s exemplified one such solution. Their films and ideas prompted comparisons with the photo-realism, poetic intent and dramatic juxtapositional image making of the &#147;Surealis Yogya&#148;. The relationship I perceive between Neo-realist cinematic practice and contemporary international documentary filmmaking encouraged me to make a documentary about Lucia rather than a purely creative or experimentally surreal work. Because of Reformasi and the changes wrought by Lucia&#146;s personal development, Perbatasan / Boundaries: Lucia Hartini, Paintings from a Life (1999 &#150; 2002) is the documentary which my first short experimental video, Pusaran / Vortex: From the Kitchen to Outer Space (1992 - 1993), made during the New Order, could not be.</field><field name="date">2006</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="identifier">http://wwwlib.murdoch.edu.au/adt/browse/view/adt-MU20090716.145044</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Advent of Methodism and the I Taukei: The Methodist Church in Fijian Nation-making</field><field name="creator">Williams, Beverley Anne Harwood</field><field name="description">This thesis is an historical anthropology of the role of the Methodist Church in Fiji, from the arrival of Methodist missionaries in 1830. At that time Fiji was a fragmented society. Fijians lived in villages on various islands, so there was no cohesion within the society. The insertion of Methodism into traditional Fijian society irreversibly changed the society, and this thesis traces the key changes that occurred. The rise to prominence of Chief Cakobau from Bau Island marks the beginning of unification of a fragmented Fiji. He formed the first Fijian government in 1871.The British Colonial authorities and the Methodists were also centrally involved in unification and the development of a national society as they set up structures to govern and evangelise the Fijians. However, the thesis argues that with the arrival of Indo-Fijians as indentured labourers to Fiji in 1879, the seeds of polarisation were planted and Indo-Fijians were left out of the frame of Fijian society. The thesis traces the involvement of Methodism, always in close relationship with the state in the twin processes of unification and polarisation.
The coups that have changed the political landscape of Fiji served to alter the relationship between the Methodist Church and the state. A schism occurred in the Methodist Church following the 1987 coup, where violence against some ministers occurred, and the Methodist constitution was suspended. Members belonging to i taukei Methodist hierarchy who insisted on Fijian paramountcy to the exclusion of Indo-Fijians have been separated irretrievably from members of the Methodist hierarchy who believe in an inclusive society irrespective of race. Increasing diversity of socio-economic status allied with hierarchical divides and different interpretations of the Church&#65533;s mission have generated conflict in the Church and society at large. Diminution of the power of the Methodist Church in Fiji has occurred since 1987, and there are both internal and external factors at work which continue this trend. The various factors influencing the Church in the present along with its future prospects are discussed.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Methodist Church</field><field name="subject">Fijian coups 1987</field><field name="subject">Fiji coup 2000</field><field name="subject">future of Methodist church in Fiji</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20091221.121517</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The application of management accounting for achieving public sector outcomes-based performance management in Queensland - a case study</field><field name="creator">Hampson, Veronica M.-M.</field><field name="description">This research investigates the application of management accounting practices (MAP) for achieving public sector outcomes-based performance management (OBPM) in Queenslandunder its Managing for Outcomes (MFO) policy. It identifies specific principles that support a performance-based environment in which outcomes-based performance is measured and for which costs are determined. This research also investigates whether there is support for the proposed MAP and examines the extent to which MAP is adopted. The research approach provides a complementary view of what should be happening with that which isactually happening in relation to MAP in the agency selected for this research.An insider research approach was undertaken for this research, drawing on a process of reflexive awareness and careful judgement to reframe, as theoretical knowledge, the tacit knowledge that has become deeply segmented in the Queensland public sector. A mixedmethod approach was used to limit the risk of the insider researcher losing objectivity and to ensure the standards of academic rigour. The approach utilised a group of criticalpractitioners, in a co-operative style of reflective inquiry, to co-create knowledge in the development of the theoretical principles. Document analyses and a case study including interviews with participants from two work units operating within one Queensland Government agency were conducted for the purposes of gaining knowledge of theQueensland Government&#8217;s MFO policy, the intended-MAP and the MAP-in-use, in particular performance measurement and cost management. An independent interviewer wasemployed wherever possible with the aim to limit possible insider researcher bias during the interview process.Findings suggest a significant gap exists between what the objectives of the MFO policy is seeking to achieve and the operational level at which this policy operates. Consultations with the critical group of practitioners and evidence from an analysis of documentation provide support for the theoretical principles. However, evidence from the case study interviews indicates a limited application of these principles. The &#8220;performance story&#8221; of theagency lacks logical links between the services it delivers and the government outcomes to which it contributes. The use of measures is not uniform throughout the agency. The agency&#8217;s ability to assess the efficiency and effectiveness to which it delivers services islimited by the fact that it reports mainly output oriented cost information. Thus, any extolments that the agency has improved their cost of delivery are largely rhetoric ratherthan anything real based on sound costing information. With an apparent compliance focus by the agency, the implication of these findings is that the costing approach adopted is one that is more likely to be based on its needs to secure sufficient resource allocations throughbudgeting processes of the Government.Opportunities exist to examine the broader social, cultural and political contexts within which Queensland government agencies operate. The findings of this study suggest that the technical merits of the proposed MAP that should be adopted by the Queensland government agencies are not sufficient to motivate agencies to adopt them. Future research that gains a fuller understanding of this aspect seems to be a logical progression.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">accounting;</field><field name="subject">management</field><field name="subject">accounting</field><field name="subject">practices;</field><field name="subject">public</field><field name="subject">sector;</field><field name="subject">outcomes-based</field><field name="subject">performance</field><field name="subject">management;</field><field name="subject">Queensland;</field><field name="subject">Managing</field><field name="subject">for</field><field name="subject">Outcomes</field><field name="subject">policy</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006529/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">An analysis of information security in selected Australian organisations</field><field name="creator">Darragh, Warren J.</field><field name="description">Previous, mainly quantitative, research has indicated that information security threats and incidents are having a significant impact on the conduct of electronic business - and office automation in general - both nationally and internationally. However, as revealed by this study's extensive review of the relevant literature, our understanding of the information security situation in Australian organisations has been quite limited. There has been very little detailed research into security threats and incidents and, equally importantly, the strategies the Australian IT industry is using to deal with them.In addressing that deficiency, this study used a qualitative, case-based research methodology involving a variety of Australian organisations. The case based approach, using in-depth interviews, facilitated a thorough examination of the information security risks (threats and incidents) and enabled assessment and analysis of management actions (countermeasures) to mitigate the identified risks.The major findings with regard to this study's research issues are:&#61623; The case-study organisations are generally highly reliant on IT for the conduct of their business and therefore would be heavily impacted if it was unavailable&#61623; They face a variety of information security threats with viruses being the most prevalent threat. The hacking threat was not as evident as reported in the literature&#61623; There are some differences between the Australian information security experience and that reported in the literature for international organisations in particular many of the very large business overseas operate on a much larger scale than those in Australia&#61623; The organisations do not believe that they are specific targets for security attacks; rather they believe that are 'targets of opportunity'&#61623; A wide range of countermeasures are employed; generally, the larger the organisation the greater the diversity and complexity of countermeasures. However, the majority do not have a clear link between risks and countermeasures&#61623; The majority of the organisations do not have a specific security budget.Whilst Australian organisations were generally well prepared and versed on security issues, the findings indicate the need for the application of best practice across the industry as a whole. A degree of cynicism regarding the nature of the hacking threat was evident &#8211; with many participants believing that the threat is overstated. Indeed this study uncovered little direct evidence of the organisations involved being subjected to actual hacker attacks.The framework developed for this study and its findings are readily adaptable for use by industry. By following the process specified in the framework, organisations will be better able to identify both likely and unlikely threats and incidents and deploy appropriate countermeasures.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">security;</field><field name="subject">organisations;</field><field name="subject">Australia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006531/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The role of technology attributes, trust and dependency on e-procuremnt adoptions: an empirical analysis of Malaysian manufacturers</field><field name="creator">Abdullah, Nik Ab Halim Nik</field><field name="description">Firms may gain benefit from each other&#8216;s skills and resources when they engaged in a long term supply chain relationship, hence, improving their competitive advantage. Adoption of information technology initiatives such as e-procurement systems may further enhance the effectiveness of the relationship. Trust and dependency factors have been identified as important elements that influence business relationships. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of technology attributes, inter-organizational trust and inter-organizational dependency manufacturer&#8216;s have towards their suppliers and customers when making an e-procurement adoption decision. This study also aims to determine if there is a critical gap between trust and dependency towards suppliers and customers and to identify which trust and dependency constructs have the most critical gap. Data was collected through case study interviews and mail survey questionnaires. It was analysed using the Partial Least Square Regression (PLS) analysis where the results indicate that dependency did have a significant positive influence on e-procurement adoption decisions, while trust did not. Size of the company, which is a control variable, has a significantly negative effect on adoption decision. Hence, this study confirmed that the level of dependency and size of company did influence an e-procurement adoption decision. Three gap analysis methods, namely the T-test analysis, weighted mean gap and the un-weighted Important Performance Analysis (IPA), were adopted and the results indicate that there is a significant gap between trust and dependency towards the supplier and customer, where the level of both variables are higher towards the customer than the supplier. Construct related to communication of problem is identified as trust factor with the most critical gap, while how partners help improve a firm&#8216;s reputation and the level of knowledge transfer have the most critical gap for dependency. This study extends the body of literature related to information technology adoption factors by investigating the effect of trust and dependency in supply chain relationships within a single study. While findings on dependency and size of company are consistent with previous studies, findings on trust provide a new paradigm to trust-related studies as it is identified as not an important factor that influence e-procurement adoption decisions, particularly in a developing country such as Malaysia.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">information</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">initiatives;</field><field name="subject">e-procurement;</field><field name="subject">technology</field><field name="subject">attributes;</field><field name="subject">trust;</field><field name="subject">dependency;</field><field name="subject">manufacturers;</field><field name="subject">Malaysia</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006532/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Expression, Purification and Crystallisation Studies with the M2 Muscarinic and H1 Histamine Receptors.</field><field name="creator">Aloia, Amanda Louise</field><field name="description">This thesis describes the expression of three human seven transmembrane receptors: the M2 Muscarinic; H1 Histamine and 5HT2A Serotonin receptors, in the baculovirus/insect cell expression system.

a case study of teacher and student beliefs about roles and responsibilities</field><field name="creator">Kehrwald, Jane</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Learner autonomy in language learning has been described as the ability to take charge of one&#8217;s own learning by determining the objectives, defining the contents and progressions, selecting methods and techniques to be used, monitoring the procedure of acquisition and evaluating what has been acquired (Holec, 1979). Few would doubt that learner autonomy in language learning is a positive thing and can lead to learners who are more proficient in the target language. These sentiments are echoed in many language programs, which have as their explicitly stated goal the development of autonomous, self-directed learners. This project is a pilot study with the aim of investigating one such program: the Languages Other Than English (LOTE) (Indonesian) program at a regional public high school.Taking a collective case study approach this investigation sought to determine two LOTE (Indonesian) learners&#8217; and their teacher&#8217;s beliefs about roles and responsibilities in the language learning process and how these beliefs are translated into their teaching and learning behaviour. Prior to any interventions aimed at facilitating the transfer of responsibility for the management of the learning process from the teacher to the learner, it is essential to access learners&#8217; and teachers&#8217; beliefs and attitudes as these have a profound impact on their learning and teaching behaviour and erroneous beliefs may lead to less effective approaches to learning, ultimately impacting on learners&#8217; success in language learning (Horwitz, 1987).The data, collected through structured interviews and classroom observations, suggest that the subjects simultaneously exhibit characteristics consistent with and in contradiction to the profiles of autonomous learners and of a teacher who engages in pedagogy aimed at the development of autonomous learners. The two LOTE learners&#8217; beliefs, and their learning behaviour, suggest that they defer responsibility to the teacher for the technical aspects of their learning, such as identifying learning objectives and topics, selecting learning activities and resources. On the other hand, through their expressed beliefs, and from the observed lessons, it appears that the two learners accept some level responsibility for reflecting and evaluating their learning and fully accept responsibility for maintaining their interest and motivations in learning the LOTE. While the LOTE learners defer responsibility for the technical aspects of their learning to their LOTE teacher, the LOTE teacher herself defers responsibility to the LOTE syllabus. However, the LOTE teacher was observediiiworking with learners, helping them to evaluate and reflect upon their learning and maintaining their interest and motivation in learning the LOTE.Recommendations for pedagogy to promote the development of learner autonomy and further research are presented.</field><field name="date">2005</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">learners;</field><field name="subject">autonomy;</field><field name="subject">learner</field><field name="subject">autonomy;</field><field name="subject">LOTE;</field><field name="subject">languages</field><field name="subject">other</field><field name="subject">than</field><field name="subject">English;</field><field name="subject">classroom;</field><field name="subject">teachers;</field><field name="subject">students;</field><field name="subject">responsibility;</field><field name="subject">responsibilities</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00003184/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Past, present and future rainfall trends in Queensland</field><field name="creator">Cottrill, Andrew</field><field name="description">Queensland and much of eastern Australia have had significant rainfall declines since ~1951, causing economic hardship on rural and urban communities. However, no significant attempt has been made to identify and understand the physical causes of the rainfall declines over southeast Queensland (SE QLD) and whether they are likely to continue into the 21st century under higher levels of global warming.In this research, climate observations, models and global climate data as well as palaeoclimate information are used to investigate past, present and future rainfall trends in SE QLD. Five global climate models (GCMs) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC&#8211;AR4) show a significant decrease in rainfall will occur over the SE QLD region during the 21st century. Observations since ~1951 show the mean sea level pressure (MSLP) has been increasing over much of Queensland, indicating the subtropical ridge has been expanding. This study attributes the increase in the MSLP and some of the rainfall decline to changes in the subtropical ridge and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Projections show increases in the MSLP over the region are likely to continue during the 21st century associated with the positive polarity of SAM. Land cover changes over SE QLD were investigated using a regional climate model and show rainfall decreases with higher surface albedo values. Finally, a palaeoenvironmental record developed using lake sediments from Lake Broadwater in SE QLD, indicates a gradual rainfall decline has occurred during the last ~3.2 kyr B.P. Hence SE QLD has undergone a slow rainfall decline since the late Holocene and also since ~1951, with these conditions likely to continue and intensify during the 21st century.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">rainfall;</field><field name="subject">trends;</field><field name="subject">Queensland</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006407/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sound of Many Voices: investigating how principals view and influence massed singing in secondary boys&#8217; schools</field><field name="creator">Barclay, Daryl James</field><field name="description">This research focused on how three principals in Melbourne boys-only schools view and influence the place of massed singing within their respective school cultures. The views of the principals themselves and their own capacity for self-reflection were critical to the thesis. The study was underpinned by three theoretical propositions: principals, although not usually involved in the teaching of massed singing, nevertheless exert an influence on it; massed singing has a unique power to enhance the broader school culture; and, cultural assumptions about gendered participation in music-making can affect student attitudes towards massed singing. The review of literature highlighted three themes which informed the conceptual framework underpinning the research: organisational and educational leadership; the construct of masculinity in boys&#8217; education and in leadership; and the nature and benefits of massed singing. Given the themes of the review, it seemed appropriate to undertake a study which would be essentially qualitative, interpretive, and based on indepth interviews with the key stakeholders. In the case of each of the three participating principals, data was collected from key documents produced by the schools, from a written questionnaire, and from a semistructured interview. The questionnaire was designed both to collect data and to raise participants&#8217; consciousness prior to the interview. The questionnaire&#8217;s 17 questions, structured so as to address the three themes identified through the review of literature, were designed to create a flexible framework for an in-depth exploration of key issues in the context of the interview itself. Findings from the study indicated that there was a very strong belief amongst the participating principals that massed singing affects the overall culture of their schools in a range of profound and significant ways; that they themselves exercise a sponsorial or support role in relation to the singing programs in their schools, and rely on experts for the effective delivery of musical content; that traditional stereotypes of gender can be challenged and debunked through student participation in massed singing; and that their own personal histories of singing, and their favourable disposition towards it, are significant factors in how effectively they are able to promote and support it. The study findings have implications for school leaders and their boards; the teaching profession in general, and choral and vocal educators in particular; parents and the arts community; government education authorities and policy makers; and this researcher himself.

This ethnography study explored the experiences and practices of cancer pain management among nurses at the Cancer Hospital, Sri Lanka. Data were collected at the Cancer Hospital in Sri Lanka during October 2007 to January 2008. Data consisted of participant observation of nursing practice in a cancer ward, semistructured interviews with 10 participants and researcher diary. Analysis of data was undertaken with Richard&#8217;s (2005) method of handling qualitative data and consisted of coding data initially and an integrative process to develop categories. Findings identified Sri Lankan nurses have minimum cancer pain management practice because of a lack of resources, large number of patients to care for, shortage of nurses and unbearable workload in this hospital setting. Additionally the nurses are powerless as they have no autonomy in practice as well as no prospects of career promotion. They are stuck in a task oriented system that rarely acknowledges cancer patients&#8217; pain management needs. It is anticipated that this study may lead to improve nursing pain management for cancer patients as well as curriculum change in nursing courses in Sri Lanka. Nursing curriculum change is required to include cancer pain management education as well as care of acute and palliative cancer patients. Additionally, the Ministry of Health in Sri Lanka needs to acknowledge the importance of palliative care service as well as pain management service and a recommendation is made to implement policies at the Cancer Hospital addressing these areas.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Cancer</field><field name="subject">Pain management</field><field name="subject">Nurses</field><field name="subject">Sri Lanka</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp227.14012010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Meaning of the Word Owoai (Save) in the Gospel of Mark (A Semiotic Analysis Approach)</field><field name="creator">Jacquin, Vivian Daniel</field><field name="description" /><field name="date">1999</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Gospel of Mark</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp225.12012010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Autonomy as Creative Action;
Reconciling human commonality and particularity</field><field name="creator">Hancock, Lisa Jane</field><field name="description">Reconciliation of human plurality, with the commonality requisite for egalitarian political order, is arguably the central question confronting political thought today.  The thesis is a response to Hannah Arendt&#146;s insight that in the wake of the twentieth-century demise of metaphysical ultimates, we must affirm human capacity for autonomous judgment as fundamental to sustaining a world &#145;fit for human habitation&#146;.  It consists of a theory of autonomy (or practical reason) designed to fully address pluralism, historicism and the critique of identity/difference.  In the light of Onora O&#146;Neill&#146;s constructivist reading of Kantian reason, autonomy as &#145;creative action&#146; is defended as the minimal human commonality which must be presupposed, to account for trans-cultural justice grounded in communication rather than coercion.

The account of autonomy employs Kant&#146;s notion of the &#145;unconditioned&#146;: freedom from determinate causes; that which is common to all by virtue of being particular to none.  Kant&#146;s merely formal concept is reconceived as a substantive experience within the world: the momentary suspension of existing cultural forms, identified as both a formal and substantive prerequisite to overcoming prejudices, and the achievement of trans-cultural communication.  Building on Hans-George Gadamer&#146;s tradition-dependent notion of hermeneutic judgment, creative action consists of first &#145;receptive attention&#146;, the suspension of existing understandings, pre-conceptions etc., and open receptivity to what is there, and second, &#145;responsive judgment&#146;, revitalisation of authoritative standards internal to a &#145;vital sphere of practice&#146; &#150; a realm of human activity whose authoritative standards are constituted through creative action.  Creative action is defended as a minimal, generic prerequisite for the realisation of any transcendent value (such as truth, justice and beauty) within a vital sphere of practice.  This ideal of autonomy coheres with a pluralist ideal of society as a web of equal, autonomous yet interdependent vital spheres of practice.  

A distinctive feature of the thesis is that it provides, in addition to a maximally-capacious account of autonomy, a radically pluralist ontological and epistemic framework.  Contemporary political thought embracing human plurality and difference has for the most part been wary of metaphysical ultimates, opting for epistemic abstinence and avoiding explicit metaphysical commitments.  I argue, however, that a substantive, philosophical account of the possibility of trans-cultural justice requires admission of that which transcends the culturally-conditioned, as well as adherence to some notion of philosophical truth.  As western thought has inherited from Platonism and the Judeo-Christian tradition a view of truth as monological, universal and unchanging, radical, pluralist revisions are required.  Within the proposed two-tiered epistemology, creative action takes the place of reason.  This epistemic framework retains the transcendent content of truth, while fully acknowledging the cultural-relativity of particular socio-cultural forms.  It allows the theory to stand as a substantive, philosophically-vindicated theory of autonomy, but without rendering it vulnerable to post-structuralist charges of cultural-imperialism.  

The thesis shows that the universalist, egalitarian commitments of the Kantian tradition can be reconciled with strong commitment to difference and diversity, but only if the philosophical and political realms abdicate their traditional positions of privilege vis a vis other spheres of practice.</field><field name="date">29.11.07</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">pluralism</field><field name="subject">Kant</field><field name="subject">Arendt</field><field name="subject">constructivist</field><field name="subject">autonomy</field><field name="subject">universal</field><field name="subject">O'Neill</field><field name="identifier">http://catalogue.flinders.edu.au./local/adt/public/adt-SFU20071129.105145</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Modelling the change in conductivity of soil associated
with the application of saline-sodic water</field><field name="creator">Ezlit, Younes Daw</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Scarcity of fresh water has led to use of low quality waters (high sodicity and salinity) that were considered unsuitable for irrigation in the past. Mismanagement of irrigation using this water can increase the potential for soil degradation and limit crop production in the long term. Irrigation using highly saline-sodic water requires appropriate management to avoid long term development of sodicity and salinity problems. The main factors that control the sodicity and salinity problems are maintenance of sufficientleaching and avoidance of soil structure degradation due to sodicity. The management options are determined by complex factors such as soil type and condition, water quality, irrigation practice and crop type.Investigating the management options for using highly saline-sodic water in irrigation experimentally is costly and time consuming. However, it could be done using anappropriate modelling tool that can handle the degradation of soil structure due to sodicity along with the chemical reaction system within the soil profile. UNSATCHEM has been widely used to model sodicity and salinity effects under irrigation. It has a feature to deal with soil structure degradation along with water and solute movement, major ion chemistry, CO2 production and movement and heat transfer under sodic conditions. It uses a hydraulic conductivity reduction function torelate the change of chemical properties to the change in hydraulic properties of the soil. However, the evaluation of the hydraulic conductivity reduction function underhigh sodicity during simulation has not been done. Hence, the core of this research project has been to improve quantification of soil structure degradation under sodicconditions and enhance the modelling of water and solute movement under sodic conditions. The hydraulic conductivity reduction function incorporated inUNSATCHEM was evaluated using data obtained from soil column experiments.Columns of two local soils were used in an experiment to investigate the effect on soil structural stability of different amendments to highly saline-sodic water rich withbicarbonates (EC = 4.6 dS/m and SAR = 117). The column experiments were used to examine the effect of reducing water pH to different levels using sulphuric acid andcombined gypsum and dilution treatments. It was found that reducing the pH of highly saline-sodic water did not enhance soil structural stability as the water applied hasnaturally high relative sodium concentrations. However, the application of diluted highly saline-sodic water amended with gypsum showed no significant effect on soil structure and permeability. It is concluded that different amendments associated with appropriate irrigation management can be applied to sustain irrigation and prevent long term salinity and sodicity problems.The data from the column experiments was used to evaluate the quantification of the soil structure degradation in UNSATCHEM. The resultant simulations for the soilcolumns showed that the estimated outflow and hydraulic conductivity were less than the experimental measurements, which suggested that the soil structure degradationwas not accounted for properly. The sodicity effect was accounted for in UNSATCHEM by a reduction function, which is a combined function of the McNeal (1968) clay swelling model and the Simunek et al. (1996) pH effect equations. The empirical pH effect equation accounts for the reduction of the conductivity due to increasing pH and clay swelling. The evaluation of UNSATCHEM under highly sodic conditions suggests that the hydraulic conductivity reduction function is limiting the UNSATCHEM performance.Consideration of the first term of the hydraulic conductivity reduction function (i.e. the McNeal (1968) clay swelling model) has highlighted the weaknesses of the McNeal model and led to develop a generic clay swelling model (GCSM). Calibration of the GCSM using the data of McNeal showed good agreement between the estimated and measured relative conductivity data. Further calibration of the GCSM using relative conductivity data obtained for five local soils also showed good agreement between the model estimation and the measured data.Coding of the generic clay swelling model into UNSATCHEM and re-simulating the column experiments showed that the modelling process is improved compared with theUNSATCHEM version containing the McNeal (1968) clay swelling model. However, the outflow and conductivity values produced were still less than measured values. This result suggested that further investigations are required to identify the effect of pH on the change of hydraulic conductivity, cation exchange capacity, and the exchangeable sodium percentage. Further research is also required regarding bicarbonate chemistry duringapplication of highly saline-sodic water.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">saline-sodic</field><field name="subject">water;</field><field name="subject">soil</field><field name="subject">conductivity;</field><field name="subject">irrigation</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006387/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Reforming the middle years curriculum in an international school: a naturalistic inquiry</field><field name="creator">Scagliarini, Richard</field><field name="description">This dissertation reports on the experiences of a small group of teachers and administrators as they endeavoured to reform the middle years curriculum of an international school in Japan. This single case study is based primarily upon the observations of the researcher, a middle school teacher at the school and a key participant in the reform process. This study is positioned in the naturalistic paradigm which allows for the accumulation of sufficient knowledge to lead to a holistic understanding of middle years curriculum reform within this context.Reforming the middle years of schooling has received renewed attention in recent years. A new paradigm is emerging about the nature of schooling in this significant stage of life that is now recognised as crucial to the formation of attitudes, values, and habits of mind that shape the individual&#8216;s identity and development as an adult. Despite the growth and status of international schools, very little is known about the nature and processes of middle years curriculum reform in this context. The central aim of this study was to provide a detailed and authentic account of the process of curriculum reform that can validate, guide and extend the current body of knowledge on middle years curriculum reform and is meaningful and useful to educators in the international school context.Three dimensions of reform emerged in this study: the process of reform, identified as a multidimensional and interconnected process that ventured through six identifiable phases; the product of the reform, the Humankind Curriculum, was found to have its core features grounded in shared understandings of effective middle schooling; and the dynamics of change, which revealed a professional learning community as the catalyst for change, with the interplay of relational trust, leadership, interpersonal relationships and collaboration as empowering the capacity for reculturing the middle school. While the findings contribute to the current body of knowledge on middle school reform in the international school context, they also provide direction for further discussion, exploration and research.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">middle</field><field name="subject">school;</field><field name="subject">middle</field><field name="subject">years;</field><field name="subject">curriculum;</field><field name="subject">Japan</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006610/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Determining broadacre crop area estimates through the use of multi-temporal modis satellite imagery for major Australian winter crops</field><field name="creator">Potgieter, Andries B.</field><field name="description">[Abstract]: Since early settlement, agriculture has been one of the main industries contributing to the livelihoods of most rural communities in Australia. The wheat grain industry is Australia&#8217;s second largest agricultural export commodity, with an average value of $3.5 billion per annum. Climate variability and change, higher input costs, and world commodity markets have put increased pressure on the sustainability of the grain industry. This has lead to an increasing demand for accurate, objective and near real-time crop production information by industry. To generate such production estimates, it is essential to determine crop area planted at the desired spatial and temporal scales. However, such information at regional scale is currently not available in Australia.The aim of this study was to determine broadacre crop area estimates through the use of multi-temporal satellite imagery for major Australian winter crops. Specifically, the objectives were to: (i) assess the ability of a range of approaches to using multi-temporal Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery to estimate total end-of-season winter crop area; (ii) determine the discriminative ability of such remote sensing approaches in estimating planted area for wheat, barley and chickpea within a specific cropping season; (iii) develop and evaluate the methodology for determining the predictability of crop area estimates well before harvest; and (iv) validate the ability of multi-temporal MODIS approaches to determine the pre-harvest and end-of-season winter crop area estimates for different seasons and regions.MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) was used as a surrogate measure for crop canopy health and architecture, for two contiguous shires in the Darling Downs region of Queensland, Australia. Multi-temporal approaches comprising principal component analysis (PCA), harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS), multi-date MODIS EVI during the crop growth period (MEVI), and two curve fitting procedures (CF1, CF2) were derived and applied. These approaches were validated against the traditional single-date approach. Early-season crop area estimates were derived through the development and application of a metric, i.e. accumulation of consecutive 16-day EVI values greater than or equal to 500, at different periods before flowering. Using ground truth data, image classification was conducted by applying supervised (maximum likelihood) and unsupervised (K-means) classification algorithms. The percent correctly classified and kappa coefficient statistics from the error matrix were used to assess pixel-scale accuracy, while shire-scale accuracy was determined using the percent error (PE) statistic. A simple linear regression of actual shire-scale data against predicted data was used to assess accuracy across regions and seasons. Actual shire-scale data was acquired from government statistical reports for the period 2000, 2001, 2003 and 2004 for the Darling Downs, and 2005 and 2006 for the entire Queensland cropping region.Results for 2003 and 2004 showed that multi-temporal HANTS, MEVI, CF1, CF2 and PCA methods achieved high overall accuracies ranging from 85% to 97% to discriminate between crops and non-crops. The accuracies for discriminating between specific crops at pixel scale were less, but still moderate, especially for wheat and barley (lowest at 57%). The HANTS approach had the smallest mean absolute percent error of 27% at shire-scale compared to other multi-temporal approaches. For early-season prediction, the 16-day EVI values greater than or equal to 500 metric showed high accuracy (94% to 98%) at a pixel scale and high R2 (0.96) for predicting total winter crop area planted.The rigour of the HANTS and the 16-day EVI values greater than or equal to 500 approaches was assessed when extrapolating over the entire Queensland cropping region for the 2005 and 2006 season. The combined early-season estimate of July and August produced high accuracy at pixel and regional scales with percent error of 8.6% and 26% below the industry estimates for 2005 and 2006 season, respectively. These satellite-derived crop area estimates were available at least four months before harvest, and deemed that such information will be highly sought after by industry in managing their risk. In discriminating among crops at pixel and regional scale, the HANTS approach showed high accuracy. Specific area estimates for wheat, barley and chickpea were, respectively, 9.9%, -5.2% and 10.9% (for 2005) and -2.8%, -78% and 64% (for 2006). Closer investigation suggested that the higher error in 2006 area estimates for barley and chickpea has emanated from the industry figures collected by the government.Area estimates of total winter crop, wheat, barley and chickpea resulted in R2 values of 0.92, 0.89, 0.82 and 0.52, when contrasted against the actual shire-scale data. A significantly high R2 (0.87) was achieved for total winter crop area estimates in Augusts across all shires for the 2006 season. Furthermore, the HANTS approach showed high accuracy in discriminating cropping area from non-cropping area and highlighted the need for accurate and up-to-date land use maps.This thesis concluded that time-series MODIS EVI imagery can be applied successfully to firstly, determine end-of-season crop area estimates at shire scale. Secondly, capturing canopy green-up through a novel metric (i.e. 16-day EVI values greater than or equal to 500) can be utilised effectively to determine early-season crop area estimates well before harvest. Finally, the extrapolability of these approaches to determine total and specific winter crop area estimates showed good utility across larger areas and seasons. Hence, it is envisaged that this technology is transferable to different regions across Australia. The utility of the remote sensing techniques developed in this study will depend on the risk agri-industry operates at within their decision and operating regimes. Trade-off between risk and value will depend on the accuracy and timing of the disseminated crop production forecast.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Australia;</field><field name="subject">winter;</field><field name="subject">crops;</field><field name="subject">broadacre;</field><field name="subject">crop</field><field name="subject">area;</field><field name="subject">estimates;</field><field name="subject">estimation;</field><field name="subject">multi-temporal</field><field name="subject">modis</field><field name="subject">satellite</field><field name="subject">imagery</field><field name="identifier">http://eprints.usq.edu.au/archive/00006613/</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Australia's military intervention in East Timor, 1999</field><field name="creator">Pietsch, Samuel</field><field name="description">This thesis argues that the Australian military intervention in East Timor in 1999 was motivated primarily by the need to defend Australia&#146;s own strategic interests. It was an act of Australian imperialism understood from a Marxist perspective, and was consistent with longstanding strategic policy in the region.&#182;
Australian policy makers have long been concerned about the security threat posed by a small and weak neighbouring state in the territory of East Timor. This led to the deployment of Australian troops to the territory in World War Two. In 1974 Australia supported Indonesia&#146;s invasion of the territory in order to prevent it from becoming a strategic liability in the context of Cold War geopolitics. But, as an indirect result of the Asian financial crisis, by September 1999 the Indonesian government&#146;s control over the territory had become untenable. Indonesia&#146;s political upheaval also raised the spectre of the &#145;Balkanisation&#146; of the Indonesian archipelago, and East Timor thus became the focal point for Australian fears about an &#145;arc of instability&#146; that arose in this period.&#182;
Australia&#146;s insertion of military forces into East Timor in 1999 served its own strategic priorities by ensuring an orderly transfer of sovereignty took place, avoiding a destabilising power vacuum as the country transitioned to independence. It also guaranteed that Australia&#146;s economic and strategic interests in the new nation could not be ignored by the United Nations or the East Timorese themselves. There are therefore underlying consistencies in Australia&#146;s policy on East Timor stretching back several decades. Despite changing contexts, and hence radically different policy responses, Australia acted throughout this time to prevent political and strategic instability in East Timor.&#182;
In addition, the intervention reinforced Australia&#146;s standing as a major power in Southeast Asia and the Southwest Pacific. The 1999 deployment therefore helped facilitate a string of subsequent Australian interventions in Pacific island nations, both by providing a model for action and by building a public consensus in favour of the use of military intervention as a policy tool.&#182;
This interpretation of events challenges the consensus among existing academic accounts. Australia&#146;s support of Indonesia&#146;s invasion and occupation of East Timor from 1974 was frequently criticised as favouring realpolitik over ethical considerations. But the 1999 intervention, which ostensibly ended severe violence and secured national independence for the territory, drew widespread support, both from the public and academic commentators. It has generally been seen as a break with previous Australian policy, and as driven by political forces outside the normal foreign policy process. Moreover, it has been almost universally regarded as a triumph for moral conduct in international affairs, and even as a redemptive moment for the Australian national conscience. Viewing the intervention as part of the longstanding strategy of Australian imperialism casts doubt on such positive evaluations.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">east timor</field><field name="subject">foriegn policy</field><field name="subject">foriegn policy australia</field><field name="subject">international relations</field><field name="subject">indonesia</field><field name="subject">imperialism</field><field name="subject">Howard doctrine</field><field name="subject">Marxism</field><field name="subject">arc of instability</field><field name="subject">humanitarian intervention</field><field name="subject">deputy sheriff</field><field name="subject">US alliance</field><field name="subject">Australia Indonesia relations</field><field name="subject">critical international relations</field><field name="subject">South Pacific</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20091214.122004</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Sky is our Roof, the Earth our Floor: Orang Rimba Customs and Religion in the Bukit Duabelas Region of Jambi, Sumatra</field><field name="creator">Sager, Steven</field><field name="description">This is an ethnographic study of the Orang Rimba ('people of the forest'), a Malay-speaking minority group who traditionally lived throughout the lowland rainforests of Jambi, Sumatra. The Orang Rimba have much in common with surrounding Malay peoples, including a similar local dialect and variants of regional Malay customs and beliefs. They are different from the Malay and other Austronesian peoples in that they have a unique, mobile, flexible economy that traditionally shifts in and out of periods of swidden gardening and a very nomadic life based on digging for wild yams, largely upon death. They have an egalitarian social system based on sharing and reciprocity, which occurs within the context of a system of relationships in which women have great rights over forest resources and extraordinary distribution rights. They are also unique for their traditional non-Islamic religious beliefs, which they believe are crucial towards maintaining their way of life in the forest based on maintaining separation with the outside world. While the Makekal Orang Rimba believe themselves to share common origins with the Malay/Melayu, the downstream world of the villagers is perceived as a source of danger and sickness, which holds the potential to disrupt the delicate relations with their gods and make life in the forest impossible.
&#182;
	Within the history of an unstable and assimilative upstream climate that was often hostile towards animist forest peoples, ethnic boundaries have served as a means to maintain their social identity, safety, and maintain a distinctive way of life in the forest. However, within the context of an egalitarian share society in which groupings of closely related women have a great deal of authority over the management and distribution of resources, including game, and the power of men is diminished through dispersed uxorilocal residence patterns, ethnic boundaries are also closely intertwined with internal power issues. The authority adult men is marked by their duty and obligation to protect and shield the rights of women from a dangerous outside world, and all outside males who are not immediate kin, through the manipulation of a convoluted system of law and fines paid in sheets of cloth. While females have great rights in their society, and the complete freedom to bully men through their passions and voice, their social mobility is limited by some of the most rigid gender divisions in all of Southeast Asia. Male authority is also marked within the domain of religion, through their duty to maintain the order and balance of their material and spiritual world (adat) in the forests by observing and enforcing religious prohibitions, which restrict relations with the outside world. This serves to facilitate close relations with their gods in matters ranging from health and subsistence to maintaining the timely occurrence of the seasonal fruits, honey, and migrations of bearded pigs. 
&#182; 
	This thesis explores how the Orang Rimba maintain their distinct social identity as 'the people of the forest' through an examination of their customs, beliefs and religion (adat), and their belief and ritual surrounding fruits and the annual season of fruits, a primary season in the lowland dipterocarp forests of Sumatra. Throughout the thesis, I explore some of the key concepts, structural categories (forest-village, upstream-downstream, mobility-sedentism, hot-cold, and reason-passion), and metaphor that run through their system of beliefs and religion, and how some of these beliefs influence their social, moral and cosmological orders, relations amongst themselves, and with the outside world. A broader theme examines how religious beliefs are intertwined with social relations, which are largely based on issues of gender, adulthood, relations of affinity and male experience in the realms of law and religion, and how some of their beliefs are interrelated with maintaining ethnic boundaries with outsiders. Some of these topics are explored in their social relations, the structure of their origin stories, gender related food prohibitions, and the management of forest resources. These issues are examined in light of the great change that has taken place over the last 30 years, a result of large-scale logging, plantations and development projects.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">orang rimba</field><field name="subject">kubu</field><field name="subject">malay</field><field name="subject">suku anak dalam</field><field name="subject">bukit duabelas</field><field name="subject">jambi</field><field name="subject">sumatra</field><field name="subject">indonesia</field><field name="subject">religion</field><field name="subject">ethnicity</field><field name="identifier">http://thesis.anu.edu.au./public/adt-ANU20091226.232154</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Power and the Global Governance of Plant Genetic Resources</field><field name="creator">Sutherland, Johanna</field><field name="description">This thesis explores the location and nature of the power that is deepening and broadening the revolution in modern biotechnologies, and which is inherent in the global governance of one type of genetic resource &#151; plant genetic resources.

The thesis argues that transnational norms, values and knowledge are important aspects of power.

Opportunities to add value were investigated with three main ideas emerging which include up-cycling the visual appearance of the garment or textiles through restyling, user interaction, and creating a narrative for the garment. The practice focussed on developing methods to incorporate these concepts as a way of extending the life of low value textiles into items that could be re-introduced into the fashion cycle2. Walker (2008) suggests that by conveying the story of a product to the consumer, the perception of value increased, and opportunities to explore this concept were investigated during the project. Experimentation with a variety of materials and techniques resulted in developing a method to re-fabricate3 threadbare and stained garments into a new material. User participation4 was investigated as a way to &#8216;add value,&#8217; as it was hoped that by enabling the user to interact with the design they would value the item more. Exploring this concept led to the development of a range of garments and garment kits that enabled the user to learn techniques and make garments using discarded textiles and clothing. The garments and kits were developed using methods and techniques that could be easily mastered and used materials that would be readily available to the user. The development of the garment kits reframed the user as a designer/maker, which is sometimes referred to as participatory design,5 and Followed Fletcher&#8217;s (2008) directive that for practical reasons, the methods need to be low tech and inexpensive. A group of research participants trialled the garment kits, made their own garment and provided feedback, which informed the final phase of the project and the development of revised kits and garments. The project suggests potential opportunities for the fashion designer may exist by focussing on the use of existing resources and heightened user connectivity in the design of garments.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Up-cycling</field><field name="subject">Textiles</field><field name="subject">Fashion</field><field name="subject">Sustainable</field><field name="subject">User</field><field name="subject">Kits</field><field name="identifier">http://hdl.handle.net/10292/810</field></doc><doc><field name="title">The Relationship Between &#8220;The Religious&#8221; and &#8220;The Secular&#8221;: The case of Australian Catholics</field><field name="creator">Daw, Joan Margaret</field><field name="description">This thesis seeks to examine the relationship between the religious and the secular as it pertains to Australian Catholics. The main line of enquiry takes the form of investigating the proposition that sociological approaches to religion that are based on the assumption of secular-religious dualism cannot adequately account for the way practising Australian Catholics live and hold their faith. The central theoretical concern of the thesis relates to the sociological construction of the religious and the secular as derived from a &#8220;this world-other world&#8221; dichotomy. The classical sociological argument that rationalism underpins the binary distinction between &#8220;this world&#8221; and the &#8220;other world&#8221; is challenged in terms of its applicability to Catholicism. Any assumption that a religious sensibility precludes rationality is also challenged. The thesis adopts the perspective of symbolic rationality which is regarded as inclusive of instrumental rationality. From this perspective, there is exploration of the extent to which the Catholic incarnational symbol system can accommodate both this-worldly and other-worldly tendencies. More specifically, there is examination of the proposition that a sacramental sensibility can be associated with the co-existence of apparent opposites &#8211; faith / reason, grace / nature, transcendence / immanence. The thesis propositions are tested by analysis of data from the 1996 Catholic Church Life Survey and the 2001 National Church Life Survey. The findings indicate that, for Australian Catholics, orthodoxy of belief is compatible with a sense of paradox and contextuality. Australian Catholics are found to have a tendency to engage humanity in both its &#8220;grace&#8221; and its &#8220;sin&#8221;. There is no evidence to support any hypothesis of mutual exclusiveness between Catholic religious commitment and openness to the wider &#8220;secular&#8221; society. Indeed, it is found that Catholic openness to the &#8220;secular&#8221; appears to be associated with openness to the &#8220;Other&#8221; &#8211; a central element of the &#8220;Catholic ethic&#8221;. Catholicism is presented as an organic religion that has the capacity to engage the multiplicities of the socio-cultural environment. Moreover, it is argued that the organic nature of Catholic engagement in secular society can be inclusive of engagement at the structural level of society. Overall, it is argued that many practising Australian Catholics have the ability to hold apparent opposites together and that the classical sociological construction of the religious and the secular in terms of dichotomy does not fit the reality of their lived faith. The thesis concludes that, in the case of Australian Catholics, there is an overarching organic relationship between the religious and the secular that can be inclusive of instrumental relationships on the institutional level.</field><field name="date">2008</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Catholics</field><field name="subject">Catholicism</field><field name="identifier">http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/digitaltheses/public/adt-acuvp228.20012010</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Development of macro/nanocellular foams in polymer nanocomposites</field><field name="creator">Bhattacharya, Subhendu</field><field name="description">This thesis focuses on the generation of fine cell polymer foams using a heterogeneous nucleating agent (nanoclay), appropriate polymer blending strategies and accurate control of foam processing parameters. Foaming behaviour of HMSPP/ clay nanocomposites and HMS-PP/EVA/clay nanocomposite blends is studied using a batch and a continuous foam injection moulding system. Morphological studies using TEM and SEM led to a few interesting deductions. It is very difficult to attain complete exfoliation in case of HMS-PP/clay nanocomposites even at low clay loadings due to a non polar nature and low graft efficiencies of HMS-PP matrix. The addition of clay to an   immiscible blend of HMS-PP/EVA results in compatibilization between the dispersed and the continuous phase. Nanocellular foams (290 nm) were subsequently generated in the batch process at a foaming temperature of 147oC and 25 seconds foaming time. The addition of immiscible EVA-28 to the HMS-PP matrix in presence of clay particles further results in reduction of foam cell sizes to 100 nm. The effect of gas concentration, foaming temperature, injection pressure, and foaming time on foam cell size was studied. It was found that the foam cell size was highly sensitive to the injection pressure at the mould gate (hence pressure drop rate) and foaming temperature. The cell size linearly decreased with increase in gas concentration and foaming time. The sensitivity of foam cell sizes to changes in processing parameters decreases with increase in clay concentration. The effect of addition of clay particle on gas solubility was modelled using the Guggenheims contact fraction approach and subsequently a new model to  predict gas solubility was developed using statistical thermodynamic tools. Additionally the effect of shear and extensional rheology on foam cell morphology was modelled. It was found that the viscoelasticity of the polymer matrix greatly affects cell sizes as compared to extensional viscosity.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">fine cell polymer foams</field><field name="subject">HMS-PP/clay nanocomposites</field><field name="subject">nanomaterials</field><field name="subject">viscoelasticity</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100122.114345</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Information Technology Project Management   Team Building for Project Success</field><field name="creator">Guiney, Andrew</field><field name="description">More than ninety per cent of projects are run by project teams and the stronger the team the more likely the project will succeed. Team building activities are performed to both increase team performance and to enhance the likelihood of project success. For the purpose of this study, information technology (IT) business projects were chosen as IT is a major driving force in business today and there is widespread dissatisfaction with the performance of IT business projects. In analysing the causes of dissatisfaction, increasingly researchers are recognising that technology is a secondary issue behind the human side of project team management. Business projects were chosen because increasingly IT is being used in the business environment to solve problems in the post-industrial era characterised by the service industry, while the manufacturing industry, from which much of the project literature has emerged, reduces. The importance of the project team in developing  IT business projects is well recognised and managers are concerned about their ability to transform an ad-hoc collection of people assigned to a particular project into a coherent, integrated project team. In most cases the activities recommended to build a successful IT business project team have been theoretically based, rather than empirically founded.    The goal of this research was to investigate the team building activities used on successful projects. To achieve this goal, the research defines the key measures of project success and establishes their relative importance; determines the most important team building activities for project success with experienced project managers; enhances the understanding of implementation of team building activities on successful projects; and provides suggestions on how to increase the likelihood of project success through focusing on team building activities. The research used the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to develop a hierarchical model linking project success measures with team building activities. Confirmation of the AHP results and additional understanding of team building activities implementation was achieved by interviewing experienced project managers.   The research found that customer satisfaction, although seldom used, was significantly more important as a project success measure than the three measures most often used - time, budget and scope. As identified by project managers, the most important team building activities for achieving customer satisfaction are team leadership; ensuring senior management support; staffing the team properly; planning the project with the team and empowering team members; building commitment among team members; developing strong communication channels and developing appropriate organisational interfaces. The research found successful projects focused on relationships in addition to the task focus of many project methodologies.   The research findings on team building activities will enable project leaders on IT business projects to develop empowered project teams with stronger affiliations and support throughout the organisation. By empowering project teams to create effective internal and external relationships there will be fewer project failures, increased customer satisfaction and improved achievement of project success.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">project management</field><field name="subject">AHP</field><field name="subject">analytic hierarchy process</field><field name="subject">team building</field><field name="subject">team building activities</field><field name="subject">project success measures</field><field name="subject">customer satisfaction</field><field name="subject">team leadership; leadership</field><field name="subject">senior management support; project staffing; project resourcing</field><field name="subject">project planning</field><field name="subject">empowering team members; project team commitment; communication channels</field><field name="subject">organisational interfaces</field><field name="subject">information technology</field><field name="subject">critical success factors</field><field name="subject">teamwork</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100122.121228</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Sense-making across collaborating disciplines in   the early stages of architectural design</field><field name="creator">Holzer, Dominik</field><field name="description">In my PhD thesis I raise the claim that a main ingredient to successful design collaboration   in architecture and engineering is to make sense out of the information that is provided by   designers and consultants as early and comprehensively as possible.   The design of buildings has become a task with such a level of complexity that a social effort   is required to coordinate and integrate the various worldviews of disciplines involved. In my   research I first analyse obstacles to sense-making across collaborating disciplines by   investigating the worldviews and priorities of the main parties involved in the design of   buildings. I then propose novel ways for exchanging knowledge and generating common   understanding between design professionals during early design and I introduce the process   of optioneering as one possible method to assist architectural and engineering work practice.   In order to address the above issues, I have embedded myself in the engineering firm Arup   in their Sydney and Melbourne offices. There, I have examined methods for communicating   and integrating aspects of building performance between designers and design consultants   over a period of three years. As part of my research at Arup, I have gained an understanding   about the everyday requirements of design professionals for sense-making in collaborative   practice.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Optioneering</field><field name="subject">Transdisciplinarity</field><field name="subject">Collaboration</field><field name="subject">Design Communication</field><field name="subject">Knowledge Management</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100122.133209</field></doc><doc><field name="title">A Housing demand model:  a case study of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, Thailand</field><field name="creator">Vajiranivesa, Pon</field><field name="description">Housing -as a special product- distinguishes the behaviour of its demand and supply. An imbalance of housing supply against demand can be a crucial part of economic crises, as happened in Thailand between 1996 and 1997. Can the housing market be controlled in a robust and rigid system? A secure market depends on balancing demand and supply dynamics; therefore, any demand has to be quantified.       This research demonstrates how housing demand can be modelled by using a System Dynamics approach. This modelling concept has been set up, using the root causes which generate housing demand. Causal factors which influence housing demand are collated, and mapped. A model simulating housing demand was developed. Keys to this are demographic, social and economic factors. This model is presented with a view to pursuing new approaches for housing demand modelling. Conceptual ideas are developed on how to quantify housing demand, and the result of the simulation can then be used as a basis for policy and decision making in housing markets.       The housing demand model developed from this research depends on many interrelated factors. These factors can be categorized into three broad groups, following precedent set by a review of available literature.

Over the course of this exegesis I aimed to explore different aspects of privacy issues related to mobile messaging, including users' awareness and the control of the privacy issues when using social networking messaging. This was demonstrated by conducting a project, which involved development of a mobile phone application and a role-playing game. The project created a frictional scenario of users communicating via mobile messaging. My research revealed that the participants lacked awareness of privacy violations when using mobile messaging, and tended not to modify their behaviours immediately when privacy breaches arose.

The study was conducted using a modified grounded theory approach. There were a total of seventeen participants; fourteen NESB nurses, and three teachers who were directly involved with their education in the CBAP. The NESB nurses who participated fell into three main groups in terms of their previous professional experience. These were:
&#65533;	Specialist 
&#65533;	Experienced generalist
&#65533;	Inexperienced generalist 
However, the level of skill and experience that the nurses brought to the educational and practice encounter made no difference to their experience of prejudice and lack of support, particularly in the clinical environment. The education and clinical experience they received challenged feelings of competency as much as they expanded feelings of competency. The NESB nurses&#65533; experiences of diversity also challenged their feelings of competence. In addition, the level of previous experience did not reduce the concern expressed by NESB nurses regarding the possibility of finding appropriate employment following registration. The implications of this for the profession and the health care system are that even the most experienced specialist and generalist nurses are not having their level of skill appropriately recognised and utilised in a timely way despite the current shortage of generalist and specialist nurses in Victoria. 
 

The outcome of the study led to the development of a model that has the potential to lead to a culture change in the clinical environment with a view to improving educational opportunities and experiences for NESB nurses who are enrolled in CBAP. In addition, the model has the potential to be useful in terms of providing local nurses with an opportunity to express their own thoughts and ideas in relation to the education of NESB nurses in the clinical environment. The model is based upon the theoretical perspectives of &#65533;productive diversity&#65533; and &#65533;clinical governance and organisational learning&#65533;.</field><field name="date">2007</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">non-English speaking nurses</field><field name="subject">education</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">professional adjustment</field><field name="subject">contextual competence</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Attitudes</field><field name="subject">Nurses -- Foreign</field><field name="identifier">http://www.lib.latrobe.edu.au./thesis/public/adt-LTU20091123.101606</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Gilgamesh, the hero of Mesopotamia</field><field name="creator">Aziz, Lamia</field><field name="description">This thesis creatively reconsiders the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh and offers a design of the ancient epic as a contemporary, illustrated text.

Traffic engineers, statutory planners, civil engineers, landscape architects and architects each make specific but isolated contributions to urban design frameworks. Each consultant documents their position predominantly through text and two dimensional representations, occasionally with specious perspective images produced by a hand rendering specialist.       This fragmented and sequential design approach inadequately addresses contemporary urban agendas, practice constraints or the potential of digital design techniques, particularly in light of increasing fears of an imminent environmental crisis and peak oil, and concerns for health, amenity and accommodating an increasingly urbanised population.      The aim of my thesis is to identify and address disparities between contemporary urban design practice and society's prevailing urban agendas for integrated and sustainable cities. The hypothesis tested by my thesis is that the gulf between prevailing urban agendas of society and urban design can be reduced by developing a 'defragmented' design approach that uses rapid, parametric, four-dimensional, digital analysis and design techniques, which build upon software commonly available within the industry.      This hypothesis has been tested in four ways: firstly through the analysis of urban agendas, design techniques and urban design paradigms, in both historic and contemporary contexts; secondly by identifying currently available technologies with the potential for adaptation and customisation; thirdly by development of new digital techniques; and finally by testing this defragmented approach on both simplified models and various case studies within an urban design practice as part of the embedded research program. Techniques I have developed and tested as part of the approach fit into four categories: firstly pedestrian connectivity - walkability and accessibility; secondly daylight amenity assessment; thirdly visual impact analysis assessing urban form visualisation, generation and composition; and finally feasibility modelling, including linked data yield analysis. I have evaluated the success of the approach in these studies with regard to practice constraints (time and budget) and contemporary society's pr evailing urban agendas.      My rapid, defragmented design approach has resulted in new techniques shown to be used quickly and concurrently 'in-house' contributing to the urban design process, whilst meeting fee budgets and project deadlines. I have demonstrated that issues that are currently difficult to solve using the constraints of conventional planning techniques can be addressed more effectively than they are currently, whilst avoiding the considerable expense of specialised hardware/software or the appointment of additional consultants.       My thesis concludes that the rapid, defragmented approach can demonstrably yield more synergistic urban design responses. The inherently flexible approach can be tailored for a myriad of different urban design scenarios, as well as potentially other disciplines. The defragmented approach can expand the realm of urban designers and increase their contribution in the generation and advocacy of sustainable planning policy and reduce the disparities between contemporary urban design practice and society's need for integrated and sustainable cities.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">defragmented</field><field name="subject">sustainable urbanism</field><field name="subject">pedestrian connectivity</field><field name="subject">amenity</field><field name="subject">transdisciplinary</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100205.114348</field></doc><doc><field name="title">'Philanthropic' Support for the Arts: Views from the Corporate Sector</field><field name="creator">Baldwin, Nigel</field><field name="description">Corporate support for the Arts, what views are held by the corporate sector about their support for the arts in Australia?  Comparison of the literature of the not-for-profit arts sector in Australia with that of the USA and Britain highlights differences in the structure of philanthropic trusts in the USA and their contribution to the not-for-profit arts and the benefit of arts funding in Britain due to support form funding from lotteries. The Australian not-for-profit arts sector does not have support from lottery funding or a long history of support from philanthropic sources. An alternate funding source is corporations, and the role they play in support for the not-for-profit arts in Australia whilst acknowledged, remains unclear. With the use of an Interpretivist approach, this has been an exploratory study. Data was generated through focused interviews with representatives from companies, agencies of government and private philanthropy.      The findings from the research have lead to the formation of the view that for the participant populations, support for the arts is considered to be sponsorship (perhaps mirroring structural changes in wider society); that is becoming focussed and strategic and in some instances comes at the expense of sports funding. Competition for corporate funding is not confined to the arts, but the wider not-for-profit sector and corporate decision making has become more astute. Policies and procedures support the decision process, aligning it with corporate goals reducing any impact of internal bias.</field><field name="date">2009</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Philanthropy</field><field name="subject">Corporate</field><field name="subject">Arts</field><field name="subject">Not-for-profit</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100205.141643</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Numerical and experimental studies of air and particle flow in the realistic human upper airway models</field><field name="creator">Li, Huafeng</field><field name="description">The human upper airway structure provides access of ambient air to the lower respiratory tract, and it as an efficient filter to cleanse inspired air of dust bacteria, and other environmental pollutants. When air passes through airway passages, it constantly changes direction, which may lead to flow separation, recirculation, secondary flow and shear stress variations along the airway surface. Therefore, it is essential to understanding the air transport processes within the upper airway system. The functions are respiratory defence mechanisms that protecting the delicate tissues of the lower airway from the often harsh conditions of the ambient air. While protecting the lower respiratory system, however, the upper airway itself becomes susceptible to various lesions and infections from filtration of environmental pollutants. Inhaled particle pollutants have been implicated as a potential cause of respiratory diseases. In contrast, inhalation of drug particles de posited directly to the lung periphery results in rapid absorption across bronchopulmonary mucosal membranes and reduction of the adverse reactions in the therapy of asthma and other respiratory disorders.  For this purpose, it is desirable that the particles should not deposit in the upper airways before reaching the lung periphery. Therefore, accurate prediction of local and regional pattern of inhaled particle deposition in the human upper airway should provide useful information to clinical researchers in assessing the pathogenic potential and possibly lead to innovation in inhalation therapies.   With the development of the increasing computer power and advancement of modeling software, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique to study dilute gas-particle flow problems is gradually becoming an attractive investigative tool. This research will provide a more complete picture of the detailed physical processes within the human upper airway system. Owing to the significant advancements in computer technologies, it will allow us to efficiently construct a full-scaled model integrating the various functional biological elements including the nasal, oral, laryngeal and more generations of the bifurcation of the human upper airway system through imagining methodologies. A significant advantage of this human model is that the differences in airway morphology and ventilation parameters that exist between healthy and diseased airways, and other factors, can be accommodated. This model will provide extensive experimental and numerical studies to probe significant insights to the particle deposition characte ristics within the complex airway passages and better understanding of any important phenomena associated with the fluid-particle flow. It will also lead to an improved understanding of fluid/particle transport under realistic physiological conditions. New concepts and numerical models to capture the main features observed in the experimental program and innovative techniques will be formulated. The ability to numerically model and a better physical understanding of the complex phenomena associated with the fluid dynamics and biological processes will be one of the major medical contributions especially targeting drug delivery and health risk analysis. Its biomedical engineering significance lies in the fact that this will enable us to accurately evaluate potential biological effects by the inhaled drug particles, facilitating new drug research and development.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">human upper airway</field><field name="subject">CFD</field><field name="subject">PIV</field><field name="subject">particle</field><field name="subject">biomedical</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100205.145548</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Using adaptation and goal context to automatically generate individual personalities for virtual characters</field><field name="creator">Sandercock, Jennifer Ellen</field><field name="description">Personality is a key component of characters that inhabit immersive virtual environments, such as games and virtual agent applications. In order to be distinguishable from other characters in the environment, each character should have its own personality in the form of different observable behaviour, not solely in its physical appearance or animation. Previous work in this field has mostly relied on time-consuming, handcrafted characters and static, trait-based approaches to personality. Our goal is a method to develop complex, individual personalities without handcrafting every behaviour. Unlike most implemented versions of personality theories, cognitive-social theories of personality address how personality is developed and adapts throughout childhood and over our lifetimes. Cognitive-social theories also emphasise the importance of situations in determining how we behave. From this basis, we believe that personality should be individual, adaptive, and based  on context. Characters in current state-of-the-art games and virtual environments do not demonstrate all of these features without extensive handcrafting.       We propose a model where personality influences both decision-making and evaluation of reward. Characters use their past experiences in the form of simple somatic markers, or gut-instinct, to make decisions; and determine rewards based on their own personal goals, rather than via external feedback. We evaluated the model by implementation of a simple game and tested it using quantitative criteria, including a purpose-designed individuality measure. Results indicate that, although characters are given the same initial personality template, it is possible to develop different personalities (in the form of behaviour) based on their unique experiences in the environment and relationships with other characters. This work shows a way forward for more automated development of personalities that are individual, context-aware and adapt to users and the environment.</field><field name="date">2010</field><field name="language">en</field><field name="relation" /><field name="subject">Games</field><field name="subject">somatic markers</field><field name="subject">personality</field><field name="subject">agents</field><field name="subject">learning</field><field name="subject">adaptation</field><field name="subject">soft goals</field><field name="identifier">http://adt.lib.rmit.edu.au/adt/public/adt-VIT20100205.162047</field></doc><doc><field name="title">Destructive Discourse: 'Japan-bashing' in the United States, Australia and Japan in the 1980s and 1990s</field><field name="creator">Narrelle Morris</field><field name="description">By the 1960s-70s, most Western commentators agreed that Japan had rehabilitated itself from World War II, in the process becoming on the whole a reliable member of the international community.
